<br>Chapter I
<br>DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE
<br>
<br><b>Alice</b> was beginning <b>to</b> get very tired <b>of</b> sitting <b>by</b> her sister <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> having nothing <b>to</b> do: once <b>or</b> twice she had peeped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> book her sister was reading, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> had <b>no</b> pictures <b>or</b> conversations in <b>it</b>, “<b>and</b> what is <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a book,” thought <b>Alice</b> “without pictures <b>or</b> conversation?”
<br>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for <b>the</b> hot day made her feel very sleepy <b>and</b> stupid), whether <b>the</b> pleasure <b>of</b> making a daisy-chain would be worth <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> getting up <b>and</b> picking <b>the</b> daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close <b>by</b> her.
<br>There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did <b>Alice</b> think <b>it</b> so VERY much out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> Rabbit say <b>to</b> itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought <b>it</b> over afterwards, <b>it</b> occurred <b>to</b> her that she ought <b>to</b> have wondered at this, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>it</b> all seemed quite natural); <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then hurried <b>on</b>, <b>Alice</b> started <b>to</b> her feet, for <b>it</b> flashed across her mind that she had never before see a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, <b>or</b> a watch <b>to</b> take out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> burning with curiosity, she ran across <b>the</b> field after <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> fortunately was just in time <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> pop down a large rabbit-hole under <b>the</b> hedge.
<br>In another moment down went <b>Alice</b> after <b>it</b>, never once considering how in <b>the</b> world she was <b>to</b> get out again.
<br>The rabbit-hole went straight <b>on</b> like a tunnel for some way, <b>and</b> then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that <b>Alice</b> had not a moment <b>to</b> think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
<br>Either <b>the</b> well was very deep, <b>or</b> she fell very slowly, for she had plenty <b>of</b> time as she went down <b>to</b> look about her <b>and</b> <b>to</b> wonder what was going <b>to</b> happen next. First, she tried <b>to</b> look down <b>and</b> make out what she was coming <b>to</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was too dark <b>to</b> see anything; then she looked at <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well, <b>and</b> noticed that they were filled with cupboards <b>and</b> book-shelves; here <b>and</b> there she saw maps <b>and</b> pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shelves as she passed; <b>it</b> was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE', <b>but</b> <b>to</b> her great disappointment <b>it</b> way empty: she did not like <b>to</b> drop <b>the</b> jar for fear <b>of</b> killing somebody, so managed <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cupboards as she fell past <b>it</b>.
<br>“Well!” thought <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing <b>of</b> tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about <b>it</b>, even if I fell off <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house!” (Which was very likely true.)
<br>Down, down, down. Would <b>the</b> fall NEVER come <b>to</b> an end! “I wonder how many miles I've fallen <b>by</b> this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting somewhere near <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, <b>Alice</b> had learnt several things <b>of</b> this sort in her lessons in <b>the</b> schoolroom, <b>and</b> though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was <b>no</b> one <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> her, still <b>it</b> was good practice <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> over) “—yes, that's about <b>the</b> right distance—<b>but</b> then I wonder what Latitude <b>or</b> Longitude I've got <b>to</b>?” (<b>Alice</b> had <b>no</b> idea what Latitude was, <b>or</b> Longitude either, <b>but</b> thought they were nice grand words <b>to</b> say.)
<br>Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH <b>the</b> earth! How funny <b>it</b>'ll seem <b>to</b> come out among <b>the</b> people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there WAS <b>no</b> one listening, this time, as <b>it</b> didn't sound at all <b>the</b> right word) “—<b>but</b> I shall have <b>to</b> ask them what <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand <b>or</b> Australia?” (<b>and</b> she tried <b>to</b> curtsey as she spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through <b>the</b> air! Do you think you could manage <b>it</b>?) “And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, <b>it</b>'ll never do <b>to</b> ask: perhaps I shall see <b>it</b> written up somewhere.”
<br>Down, down, down. There was nothing else <b>to</b> do, so <b>Alice</b> soon began talking again. Dinah'll miss me very much <b>to</b>-night, I should think!” (Dinah was <b>the</b> cat.) “I hope they'll remember her saucer <b>of</b> milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are <b>no</b> mice in <b>the</b> air, I'm afraid, <b>but</b> you might catch a bat, <b>and</b> that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here <b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> get rather sleepy, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> saying <b>to</b> herself, in a dreamy sort <b>of</b> way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” <b>and</b> sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, <b>it</b> didn't much matter which way she put <b>it</b>. She felt that she was dozing off, <b>and</b> had just begun <b>to</b> dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, <b>and</b> saying <b>to</b> her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me <b>the</b> truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap <b>of</b> stick <b>and</b> dry leaves, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fall was over.
<br><b>Alice</b> was not a bit hurt, <b>and</b> she jumped up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her feet in a moment: she looked up, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down <b>it</b>. There was not a moment <b>to</b> be lost: away went <b>Alice</b> like <b>the</b> wind, <b>and</b> was just in time <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b> say, as <b>it</b> turned a corner, “Oh my ears <b>and</b> whiskers, how late <b>it</b>'s getting!” She was close behind <b>it</b> when she turned <b>to</b> corner, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit was <b>no</b> longer <b>to</b> be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up <b>by</b> a row <b>of</b> lamps hanging from <b>the</b> roof.
<br>There were doors all round <b>the</b> hall, <b>but</b> they were all locked; <b>and</b> when <b>Alice</b> had been all <b>the</b> way down one side <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> other, trying every door, she walked sadly down <b>the</b> middle, wondering how she was ever <b>to</b> get out again.
<br>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made <b>of</b> solid glass; there was nothing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> except a tiny golden key, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>'s first thought was that <b>it</b> might belong <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall; <b>but</b>, alas! either <b>the</b> locks were too large, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> key was too small, <b>but</b> at any rate <b>it</b> would not open any <b>of</b> them. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b> was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried <b>the</b> little golden key in <b>the</b> lock, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> her great delight <b>it</b> fitted!
<br><b>Alice</b> opened <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> found that <b>it</b> led <b>into</b> a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down <b>and</b> looked along <b>the</b> passage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed <b>to</b> get out <b>of</b> that dark hall, <b>and</b> wander about among those beds <b>of</b> bright flowers <b>and</b> those cool fountains, <b>but</b> she could <b>to</b> even get her head thought he doorway; “<b>and</b> even if my head would go through,” thought poor <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b> would be <b>of</b> very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how <b>to</b> begin.” For, you see, so many out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way things had happened lately, that <b>Alice</b> had begun <b>to</b> think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
<br>There seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> use in waiting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> little door, so she went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, half hoping she might find another key <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> at any rate a book <b>or</b> rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, (`which certainly was not here before,” said <b>Alice</b>,) <b>and</b> round <b>the</b> neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle was a paper label, with <b>the</b> words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in large letters.
<br>It was all very well <b>to</b> say “Drink me,” <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wise little <b>Alice</b> was not going <b>to</b> do THAT in a hurry. “No, I'll look first,” she said, “<b>and</b> see whether <b>it</b>'s marked «poison» <b>or</b> not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, <b>and</b> eaten up <b>by</b> wild beasts <b>and</b> other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember <b>the</b> simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if your hold <b>it</b> too long; <b>and</b> that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, <b>it</b> usually bleeds; <b>and</b> she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” <b>it</b> is almost certain <b>to</b> disagree with you, sooner <b>or</b> later.
<br>However, this bottle was NOT marked “poison,” so <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> taste <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> finding <b>it</b> very nice, (<b>it</b> had, in fact, a sort <b>of</b> mixed flavour <b>of</b> cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, <b>and</b> hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished <b>it</b> off.
<br>“What a curious feeling!” said <b>Alice</b>; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”
<br>And so <b>it</b> was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, <b>and</b> her face brightened up at <b>the</b> thought that she was now <b>the</b> right size for going though <b>the</b> little door <b>into</b> that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes <b>to</b> see if she was going <b>to</b> shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for <b>it</b> might end, you know,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried <b>to</b> fancy what <b>the</b> flame <b>of</b> a candle is like after <b>the</b> candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
<br>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided <b>on</b> going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden at once; <b>but</b>, alas for poor <b>Alice</b>! when she got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, she found he had forgotten <b>the</b> little golden key, <b>and</b> when she went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table for <b>it</b>, she found she could not possibly reach <b>it</b>: she could see <b>it</b> quite plainly through <b>the</b> glass, <b>and</b> she tried her best <b>to</b> climb up one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> was too slippery; <b>and</b> when she had tired herself out with trying, <b>the</b> poor little thing sat down <b>and</b> cried.
<br>“Come, there's <b>no</b> use in crying like that!” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, rather sharply; “I advise you <b>to</b> leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed <b>it</b>), <b>and</b> sometimes she scolded herself so severely as <b>to</b> bring tears <b>into</b> her eyes; <b>and</b> once she remembered trying <b>to</b> box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game <b>of</b> croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond <b>of</b> pretending <b>to</b> be two people. “But <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> use now,” thought poor <b>Alice</b>, “<b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> be two people! Why, there's hardly enough <b>of</b> me left <b>to</b> make ONE respectable person!”
<br>Soon her eye fell <b>on</b> a little glass box that was lying under <b>the</b> table: she opened <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> found in <b>it</b> a very small cake, <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I'll eat <b>it</b>,” said Alive, “<b>and</b> if <b>it</b> makes me grow larger, I can reach <b>the</b> key; <b>and</b> if <b>it</b> makes me grow smaller, I can creep under <b>the</b> door; so either way I'll get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>and</b> I don't care which happens!”
<br>She ate a little bit, <b>and</b> said anxiously <b>to</b> herself, “Which way? Which way?', holding her hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> her head <b>to</b> feel which way <b>it</b> was growing, <b>and</b> she was quite surprised <b>to</b> find that she remained <b>the</b> same size: <b>to</b> be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, <b>but</b> <b>Alice</b> had got so much <b>into</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> expecting nothing <b>but</b> out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way things <b>to</b> happen, that <b>it</b> seemed quite dull <b>and</b> stupid for life <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> common way.
<br>So she set <b>to</b> work, <b>and</b> very soon finished off <b>the</b> cake.

<br>Chapter II
<br>THE POOL OF TEARS
<br>
<br>“Curiouser <b>and</b> curiouser!” cried <b>Alice</b> (she was so much surprised, that for <b>the</b> moment she quite forgot how <b>to</b> speak good English); “now I'm opening out like <b>the</b> largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed <b>to</b> be almost out <b>of</b> sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put <b>on</b> your shoes <b>and</b> stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off <b>to</b> trouble myself about you: you must manage <b>the</b> best way you can; —<b>but</b> I must be kind <b>to</b> them,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “<b>or</b> perhaps they won't walk <b>the</b> way I want <b>to</b> go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair <b>of</b> boots every Christmas.”
<br>And she went <b>on</b> planning <b>to</b> herself how she would manage <b>it</b>. “They must go <b>by</b> <b>the</b> carrier,” she thought; “<b>and</b> how funny <b>it</b>'ll seem, sending presents <b>to</b> one's own feet! And how odd <b>the</b> directions will look!
<br>
<br>ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
<br>HEARTHRUG,
<br>NEAR THE FENDER,
<br>(WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
<br>
<br>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!”
<br>Just then her head struck against <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, <b>and</b> she at once took up <b>the</b> little golden key <b>and</b> hurried off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden door.
<br>Poor <b>Alice</b>! It was as much as she could do, lying down <b>on</b> one side, <b>to</b> look through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden with one eye; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> cry again.
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> be ashamed <b>of</b> yourself,” said <b>Alice</b>, “a great girl like you,” (she might well say this), “<b>to</b> go <b>on</b> crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> same, shedding gallons <b>of</b> tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep <b>and</b> reaching half down <b>the</b> hall.
<br>After a time she heard a little pattering <b>of</b> feet in <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> she hastily dried her eyes <b>to</b> see what was coming. It was <b>the</b> White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair <b>of</b> white kid gloves in one hand <b>and</b> a large fan in <b>the</b> other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering <b>to</b> himself as he came, “Oh! <b>the</b> Duchess, <b>the</b> Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!” <b>Alice</b> felt so desperate that she was ready <b>to</b> ask help <b>of</b> any one; so, when <b>the</b> Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped <b>the</b> white kid gloves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fan, <b>and</b> skurried away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness as hard as he could go.
<br><b>Alice</b> took up <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> gloves, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all <b>the</b> time she went <b>on</b> talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is <b>to</b>-day! And yesterday things went <b>on</b> just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in <b>the</b> night? Let me think: was I <b>the</b> same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not <b>the</b> same, <b>the</b> next question is, Who in <b>the</b> world am I? Ah, THAT'S <b>the</b> great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all <b>the</b> children she knew that were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same age as herself, <b>to</b> see if she could have been changed for any <b>of</b> them.
<br>“I'm sure I'm not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long ringlets, <b>and</b> mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; <b>and</b> I'm sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts <b>of</b> things, <b>and</b> she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, <b>and</b> I'm I, <b>and</b>—oh dear, how puzzling <b>it</b> all is! I'll try if I know all <b>the</b> things I used <b>to</b> know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, <b>and</b> four times six is thirteen, <b>and</b> four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get <b>to</b> twenty at that rate! However, <b>the</b> Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Paris, <b>and</b> Paris is <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Rome, <b>and</b> Rome—<b>no</b>, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try <b>and</b> say «How doth <b>the</b> little— «” <b>and</b> she crossed her hands <b>on</b> her lap as if she were saying lessons, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> her voice sounded hoarse <b>and</b> strange, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words did not come <b>the</b> same as they used <b>to</b> do:—
<br>“How doth <b>the</b> little crocodile
<br>Improve his shining tail,
<br>And pour <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile
<br>On every golden scale!
<br>“How cheerfully he seems <b>to</b> grin,
<br>How neatly spread his claws,
<br>And welcome little fishes in
<br>With gently smiling jaws!”
<br>“I'm sure those are not <b>the</b> right words,” said poor <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> her eyes filled with tears again as she went <b>on</b>, “I must be Mabel after all, <b>and</b> I shall have <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> live in that poky little house, <b>and</b> have next <b>to</b> <b>no</b> toys <b>to</b> play with, <b>and</b> oh! ever so many lessons <b>to</b> learn! No, I've made up my mind about <b>it</b>; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be <b>no</b> use their putting their heads down <b>and</b> saying «Come up again, dear!» I shall only look up <b>and</b> say «Who am I then? Tell me that first, <b>and</b> then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"—<b>but</b>, oh dear!” cried <b>Alice</b>, with a sudden burst <b>of</b> tears, “I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired <b>of</b> being all alone here!”
<br>As she said this she looked down at her hands, <b>and</b> was surprised <b>to</b> see that she had put <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. “How CAN I have done that?” she thought. “I must be growing small again.” She got up <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table <b>to</b> measure herself <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, <b>and</b> was going <b>on</b> shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> this was <b>the</b> fan she was holding, <b>and</b> she dropped <b>it</b> hastily, just in time <b>to</b> avoid shrinking away altogether.
<br>“That WAS a narrow escape!” said <b>Alice</b>, a good deal frightened at <b>the</b> sudden change, <b>but</b> very glad <b>to</b> find herself still in existence; “<b>and</b> now for <b>the</b> garden!” <b>and</b> she ran with all speed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little door: <b>but</b>, alas! <b>the</b> little door was shut again, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little golden key was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glass table as before, “<b>and</b> things are worse than ever,” thought <b>the</b> poor child, “for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare <b>it</b>'s too bad, that <b>it</b> is!”
<br>As she said these words her foot slipped, <b>and</b> in another moment, splash! she was up <b>to</b> her chin in salt water. He first idea was that she had somehow fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea, “<b>and</b> in that case I can go back <b>by</b> railway,” she said <b>to</b> herself. (<b>Alice</b> had been <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seaside once in her life, <b>and</b> had come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general conclusion, that wherever you go <b>to</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English coast you find a number <b>of</b> bathing machines in <b>the</b> sea, some children digging in <b>the</b> sand with wooden spades, then a row <b>of</b> lodging houses, <b>and</b> behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in <b>the</b> pool <b>of</b> tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.
<br>“I wish I hadn't cried so much!” said <b>Alice</b>, as she swam about, trying <b>to</b> find her way out. “I shall be punished for <b>it</b> now, I suppose, <b>by</b> being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, <b>to</b> be sure! However, everything is queer <b>to</b>-day.”
<br>Just then she heard something splashing about in <b>the</b> pool a little way off, <b>and</b> she swam nearer <b>to</b> make out what <b>it</b> was: at first she thought <b>it</b> must be a walrus <b>or</b> hippopotamus, <b>but</b> then she remembered how small she was now, <b>and</b> she soon made out that <b>it</b> was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.
<br>“Would <b>it</b> be <b>of</b> any use, now,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “<b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> this mouse? Everything is so out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way down here, that I should think very likely <b>it</b> can talk: at any rate, there's <b>no</b> harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse, do you know <b>the</b> way out <b>of</b> this pool? I am very tired <b>of</b> swimming about here, O Mouse!” (<b>Alice</b> thought this must be <b>the</b> right way <b>of</b> speaking <b>to</b> a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, <b>but</b> she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, “A mouse—<b>of</b> a mouse—<b>to</b> a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!” The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> her <b>to</b> wink with one <b>of</b> its little eyes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> said nothing.
<br>“Perhaps <b>it</b> doesn't understand English,” thought <b>Alice</b>; “I daresay <b>it</b>'s a French mouse, come over with William <b>the</b> Conqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge <b>of</b> history, <b>Alice</b> had <b>no</b> very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Ou est ma chatte?” which was <b>the</b> first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried <b>Alice</b> hastily, afraid that she had hurt <b>the</b> poor animal's feelings. “I quite forgot you didn't like cats.”
<br>“Not like cats!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would YOU like cats if you were me?”
<br>“Well, perhaps not,” said <b>Alice</b> in a soothing tone: “don't be angry about <b>it</b>. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy <b>to</b> cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b>, half <b>to</b> herself, as she swam lazily about in <b>the</b> pool, “<b>and</b> she sits purring so nicely <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, licking her paws <b>and</b> washing her face—<b>and</b> she is such a nice soft thing <b>to</b> nurse—<b>and</b> she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried <b>Alice</b> again, for this time <b>the</b> Mouse was bristling all over, <b>and</b> she felt certain <b>it</b> must be really offended. “We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.”
<br>“We indeed!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, who was trembling down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his tail. “As if I would talk <b>on</b> such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear <b>the</b> name again!”
<br>“I won't indeed!” said <b>Alice</b>, in a great hurry <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> conversation. “Are you—are you fond—<b>of</b>—<b>of</b> dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b> eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like <b>to</b> show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And <b>it</b>'ll fetch things when you throw them, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>'ll sit up <b>and</b> beg for its dinner, <b>and</b> all sorts <b>of</b> thins—I can't remember half <b>of</b> them—<b>and</b> <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> a farmer, you know, <b>and</b> he says <b>it</b>'s so useful, <b>it</b>'s worth a hundred pounds! He says <b>it</b> kills all <b>the</b> rats <b>and</b>—oh dear!” cried <b>Alice</b> in a sorrowful tone, “I'm afraid I've offended <b>it</b> again!” For <b>the</b> Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as <b>it</b> could go, <b>and</b> making quite a commotion in <b>the</b> pool as <b>it</b> went.
<br>So she called softly after <b>it</b>, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, <b>and</b> we won't talk about cats <b>or</b> dogs either, if you don't like them!” When <b>the</b> Mouse heard this, <b>it</b> turned round <b>and</b> swam slowly back <b>to</b> her: its face was quite pale (with passion, <b>Alice</b> thought), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore, <b>and</b> then I'll tell you my history, <b>and</b> you'll understand why <b>it</b> is I hate cats <b>and</b> dogs.”
<br>It was high time <b>to</b> go, for <b>the</b> pool was getting quite crowded with <b>the</b> birds <b>and</b> animals that had fallen <b>into</b> <b>it</b>: there were a Duck <b>and</b> a Dodo, a Lory <b>and</b> an Eaglet, <b>and</b> several other curious creatures. <b>Alice</b> led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whole party swam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter III
<br>A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE
<br>
<br>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank—<b>the</b> birds with draggled feathers, <b>the</b> animals with their fur clinging close <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> all dripping wet, cross, <b>and</b> uncomfortable.
<br>The first question <b>of</b> course was, how <b>to</b> get dry again: they had a consultation about this, <b>and</b> after a few minutes <b>it</b> seemed quite natural <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with <b>the</b> Lory, who at last turned sulky, <b>and</b> would only say, “I am older than you, <b>and</b> must know better'; <b>and</b> this <b>Alice</b> would not allow without knowing how old <b>it</b> was, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> Lory positively refused <b>to</b> tell its age, there was <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> be said.
<br>At last <b>the</b> Mouse, who seemed <b>to</b> be a person <b>of</b> authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> me! I'LL soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with <b>the</b> Mouse in <b>the</b> middle. <b>Alice</b> kept her eyes anxiously fixed <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
<br>“Ahem!” said <b>the</b> Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This is <b>the</b> driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! «William <b>the</b> Conqueror, whose cause was favoured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pope, was soon submitted <b>to</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English, who wanted leaders, <b>and</b> had been <b>of</b> late much accustomed <b>to</b> usurpation <b>and</b> conquest. Edwin <b>and</b> Morcar, <b>the</b> earls <b>of</b> Mercia <b>and</b> Northumbria- -"“
<br>“Ugh!” said <b>the</b> Lory, with a shiver.
<br>“I beg your pardon!” said <b>the</b> Mouse, frowning, <b>but</b> very politely: “Did you speak?”
<br>“Not I!” said <b>the</b> Lory hastily.
<br>“I thought you did,” said <b>the</b> Mouse. “—I proceed. «Edwin <b>and</b> Morcar, <b>the</b> earls <b>of</b> Mercia <b>and</b> Northumbria, declared for him: <b>and</b> even Stigand, <b>the</b> patriotic archbishop <b>of</b> Canterbury, found <b>it</b> advisable—"“
<br>“Found WHAT?” said <b>the</b> Duck.
<br>“Found IT,” <b>the</b> Mouse replied rather crossly: “<b>of</b> course you know what «<b>it</b>» means.”
<br>“I know what «<b>it</b>» means well enough, when I find a thing,” said <b>the</b> Duck: “<b>it</b>'s generally a frog <b>or</b> a worm. The question is, what did <b>the</b> archbishop find?”
<br>The Mouse did not notice this question, <b>but</b> hurriedly went <b>on</b>, “"—found <b>it</b> advisable <b>to</b> go with Edgar Atheling <b>to</b> meet William <b>and</b> offer him <b>the</b> crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But <b>the</b> insolence <b>of</b> his Normans—» How are you getting <b>on</b> now, my dear?” <b>it</b> continued, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> as <b>it</b> spoke.
<br>“As wet as ever,” said <b>Alice</b> in a melancholy tone: “<b>it</b> doesn't seem <b>to</b> dry me at all.”
<br>“In that case,” said <b>the</b> Dodo solemnly, rising <b>to</b> its feet, “I move that <b>the</b> meeting adjourn, for <b>the</b> immediate adoption <b>of</b> more energetic remedies—”
<br>“Speak English!” said <b>the</b> Eaglet. “I don't know <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> half those long words, <b>and</b>, what's more, I don't believe you do either!” And <b>the</b> Eaglet bent down its head <b>to</b> hide a smile: some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other birds tittered audibly.
<br>“What I was going <b>to</b> say,” said <b>the</b> Dodo in an offended tone, “was, that <b>the</b> best thing <b>to</b> get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
<br>“What IS a Caucus-race?” said <b>Alice</b>; not that she wanted much <b>to</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Dodo had paused as if <b>it</b> thought that SOMEBODY ought <b>to</b> speak, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> one else seemed inclined <b>to</b> say anything.
<br>“Why,” said <b>the</b> Dodo, “<b>the</b> best way <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b> is <b>to</b> do <b>it</b>.” (And, as you might like <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how <b>the</b> Dodo managed <b>it</b>.)
<br>First <b>it</b> marked out a race-course, in a sort <b>of</b> circle, (`<b>the</b> exact shape doesn't matter,” <b>it</b> said,) <b>and</b> then all <b>the</b> party were placed along <b>the</b> course, here <b>and</b> there. There was <b>no</b> “One, two, three, <b>and</b> away,” <b>but</b> they began running when they liked, <b>and</b> left off when they liked, so that <b>it</b> was not easy <b>to</b> know when <b>the</b> race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour <b>or</b> so, <b>and</b> were quite dry again, <b>the</b> Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” <b>and</b> they all crowded round <b>it</b>, panting, <b>and</b> asking, “But who has won?”
<br>This question <b>the</b> Dodo could not answer without a great deal <b>of</b> thought, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (<b>the</b> position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in <b>the</b> pictures <b>of</b> him), while <b>the</b> rest waited in silence. At last <b>the</b> Dodo said, “EVERYBODY has won, <b>and</b> all must have prizes.”
<br>“But who is <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> prizes?” quite a chorus <b>of</b> voices asked.
<br>“Why, SHE, <b>of</b> course,” said <b>the</b> Dodo, pointing <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> with one finger; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”
<br><b>Alice</b> had <b>no</b> idea what <b>to</b> do, <b>and</b> in despair she put her hand in her pocket, <b>and</b> pulled out a box <b>of</b> comfits, (luckily <b>the</b> salt water had not got <b>into</b> <b>it</b>), <b>and</b> handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.
<br>“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said <b>the</b> Mouse.
<br>“Of course,” <b>the</b> Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in your pocket?” he went <b>on</b>, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Only a thimble,” said <b>Alice</b> sadly.
<br>“Hand <b>it</b> over here,” said <b>the</b> Dodo.
<br>Then they all crowded round her once more, while <b>the</b> Dodo solemnly presented <b>the</b> thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance <b>of</b> this elegant thimble'; <b>and</b>, when <b>it</b> had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
<br><b>Alice</b> thought <b>the</b> whole thing very absurd, <b>but</b> they all looked so grave that she did not dare <b>to</b> laugh; <b>and</b>, as she could not think <b>of</b> anything <b>to</b> say, she simply bowed, <b>and</b> took <b>the</b> thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
<br>The next thing was <b>to</b> eat <b>the</b> comfits: this caused some noise <b>and</b> confusion, as <b>the</b> large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> small ones choked <b>and</b> had <b>to</b> be patted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. However, <b>it</b> was over at last, <b>and</b> they sat down again in a ring, <b>and</b> begged <b>the</b> Mouse <b>to</b> tell them something more.
<br>“You promised <b>to</b> tell me your history, you know,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>and</b> why <b>it</b> is you hate—C <b>and</b> D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that <b>it</b> would be offended again.
<br>“Mine is a long <b>and</b> a sad tale!” said <b>the</b> Mouse, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> sighing.
<br>“It IS a long tail, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b>, looking down with wonder at <b>the</b> Mouse's tail” “<b>but</b> why do you call <b>it</b> sad?” And she kept <b>on</b> puzzling about <b>it</b> while <b>the</b> Mouse was speaking, so that her idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale was something like this:—
<br>
<br>“Fury said <b>to</b> a mouse,
<br>That he met in <b>the</b> house,
<br>«Let us both go <b>to</b> law: I will prosecute YOU.
<br>
<br>—Come, I'll take <b>no</b> denial;
<br>We must have a trial:
<br>For really this morning I've nothing <b>to</b> do.»
<br>
<br>Said <b>the</b> mouse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cur,
<br>«Such a trial, dear Sir,
<br>With <b>no</b> jury <b>or</b> judge,
<br>would be wasting our breath.»
<br>
<br>«I'll be judge, I'll be jury,»
<br>Said cunning old Fury:
<br>«I'll try <b>the</b> whole cause,
<br><b>and</b> condemn you <b>to</b> death.»
<br>
<br>“You are not attending!” said <b>the</b> Mouse <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> severely. “What are you thinking <b>of</b>?”
<br>“I beg your pardon,” said <b>Alice</b> very humbly: “you had got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fifth bend, I think?”
<br>“I had NOT!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, sharply <b>and</b> very angrily.
<br>“A knot!” said <b>Alice</b>, always ready <b>to</b> make herself useful, <b>and</b> looking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help <b>to</b> undo <b>it</b>!”
<br>“I shall do nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort,” said <b>the</b> Mouse, getting up <b>and</b> walking away. “You insult me <b>by</b> talking such nonsense!”
<br>“I didn't mean <b>it</b>!” pleaded poor <b>Alice</b>. “But you're so easily offended, you know!”
<br>The Mouse only growled in reply.
<br>“Please come back <b>and</b> finish your story!” <b>Alice</b> called after <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Mouse only shook its head impatiently, <b>and</b> walked a little quicker.
<br>“What a pity <b>it</b> wouldn't stay!” sighed <b>the</b> Lory, as soon as <b>it</b> was quite out <b>of</b> sight; <b>and</b> an old Crab took <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> saying <b>to</b> her daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson <b>to</b> you never <b>to</b> lose YOUR temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said <b>the</b> young Crab, a little snappishly. “You're enough <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> patience <b>of</b> an oyster!”
<br>“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said <b>Alice</b> aloud, addressing nobody in particular. “She'd soon fetch <b>it</b> back!”
<br>“And who is Dinah, if I might venture <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> question?” said <b>the</b> Lory.
<br><b>Alice</b> replied eagerly, for she was always ready <b>to</b> talk about her pet: “Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after <b>the</b> birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at <b>it</b>!”
<br>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among <b>the</b> party. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds hurried off at once: one <b>the</b> old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; <b>the</b> night-air doesn't suit my throat!” <b>and</b> a Canary called out in a trembling voice <b>to</b> its children, “Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> was soon left alone.
<br>“I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!” she said <b>to</b> herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems <b>to</b> like her, down here, <b>and</b> I'm sure she's <b>the</b> best cat in <b>the</b> world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!” And here poor <b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> cry again, for she felt very lonely <b>and</b> low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering <b>of</b> footsteps in <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> she looked up eagerly, half hoping that <b>the</b> Mouse had changed his mind, <b>and</b> was coming back <b>to</b> finish his story.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter IV
<br>THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL
<br>
<br>It was <b>the</b> White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, <b>and</b> looking anxiously about as <b>it</b> went, as if <b>it</b> had lost something; <b>and</b> she heard <b>it</b> muttering <b>to</b> itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur <b>and</b> whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?” <b>Alice</b> guessed in a moment that <b>it</b> was looking for <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pair <b>of</b> white kid gloves, <b>and</b> she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, <b>but</b> they were nowhere <b>to</b> be seen—everything seemed <b>to</b> have changed since her swim in <b>the</b> pool, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> great hall, with <b>the</b> glass table <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little door, had vanished completely.
<br>Very soon <b>the</b> Rabbit noticed <b>Alice</b>, as she went hunting about, <b>and</b> called out <b>to</b> her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, <b>and</b> fetch me a pair <b>of</b> gloves <b>and</b> a fan! Quick, now!” And <b>Alice</b> was so much frightened that she ran off at once in <b>the</b> direction <b>it</b> pointed <b>to</b>, without trying <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> mistake <b>it</b> had made.
<br>“He took me for his housemaid,” she said <b>to</b> herself as she ran. “How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his fan <b>and</b> gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> which was a bright brass plate with <b>the</b> name “W. RABBIT” engraved upon <b>it</b>. She went in without knocking, <b>and</b> hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet <b>the</b> real Mary Ann, <b>and</b> be turned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house before she had found <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> gloves.
<br>“How queer <b>it</b> seems,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> herself, “<b>to</b> be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me <b>on</b> messages next!” And she began fancying <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> thing that would happen: “"Miss <b>Alice</b>! Come here directly, <b>and</b> get ready for your walk!» «Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got <b>to</b> see that <b>the</b> mouse doesn't get out.» Only I don't think,” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b>, “that they'd let Dinah stop in <b>the</b> house if <b>it</b> began ordering people about like that!”
<br>By this time she had found her way <b>into</b> a tidy little room with a table in <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> (as she had hoped) a fan <b>and</b> two <b>or</b> three pairs <b>of</b> tiny white kid gloves: she took up <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> a pair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gloves, <b>and</b> was just going <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near <b>the</b> looking- glass. There was <b>no</b> label this time with <b>the</b> words “DRINK ME,” <b>but</b> nevertheless she uncorked <b>it</b> <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> her lips. “I know SOMETHING interesting is sure <b>to</b> happen,” she said <b>to</b> herself, “whenever I eat <b>or</b> drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does. I do hope <b>it</b>'ll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired <b>of</b> being such a tiny little thing!”
<br>It did so indeed, <b>and</b> much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half <b>the</b> bottle, she found her head pressing against <b>the</b> ceiling, <b>and</b> had <b>to</b> stoop <b>to</b> save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down <b>the</b> bottle, saying <b>to</b> herself “That's quite enough—I hope I shan't grow any more—As <b>it</b> is, I can't get out at <b>the</b> door—I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!”
<br>Alas! <b>it</b> was too late <b>to</b> wish that! She went <b>on</b> growing, <b>and</b> growing, <b>and</b> very soon had <b>to</b> kneel down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, <b>and</b> she tried <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> lying down with one elbow against <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other arm curled round her head. Still she went <b>on</b> growing, <b>and</b>, as a last resource, she put one arm out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> one foot up <b>the</b> chimney, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> herself “Now I can do <b>no</b> more, whatever happens. What WILL become <b>of</b> me?”
<br>Luckily for <b>Alice</b>, <b>the</b> little magic bottle had now had its full effect, <b>and</b> she grew <b>no</b> larger: still <b>it</b> was very uncomfortable, <b>and</b>, as there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> chance <b>of</b> her ever getting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room again, <b>no</b> wonder she felt unhappy.
<br>“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor <b>Alice</b>, “when one wasn't always growing larger <b>and</b> smaller, <b>and</b> being ordered about <b>by</b> mice <b>and</b> rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—<b>and</b> yet—<b>and</b> yet—<b>it</b>'s rather curious, you know, this sort <b>of</b> life! I do wonder what CAN have happened <b>to</b> me! When I used <b>to</b> read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind <b>of</b> thing never happened, <b>and</b> now here I am in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> one! There ought <b>to</b> be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one—<b>but</b> I'm grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there's <b>no</b> room <b>to</b> grow up any more HERE.”
<br>“But then,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “shall I NEVER get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never <b>to</b> be an old woman- -<b>but</b> then—always <b>to</b> have lessons <b>to</b> learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!”
<br>“Oh, you foolish <b>Alice</b>!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> room at all for any lesson-books!”
<br>And so she went <b>on</b>, taking first one side <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> other, <b>and</b> making quite a conversation <b>of</b> <b>it</b> altogether; <b>but</b> after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, <b>and</b> stopped <b>to</b> listen.
<br>“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said <b>the</b> voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then came a little pattering <b>of</b> feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs. <b>Alice</b> knew <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> Rabbit coming <b>to</b> look for her, <b>and</b> she trembled till she shook <b>the</b> house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as <b>the</b> Rabbit, <b>and</b> had <b>no</b> reason <b>to</b> be afraid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>Presently <b>the</b> Rabbit came up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> open <b>it</b>; <b>but</b>, as <b>the</b> door opened inwards, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>'s elbow was pressed hard against <b>it</b>, that attempt proved a failure. <b>Alice</b> heard <b>it</b> say <b>to</b> itself “Then I'll go round <b>and</b> get in at <b>the</b> window.”
<br>“THAT you won't” thought <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b>, after waiting till she fancied she heard <b>the</b> Rabbit just under <b>the</b> window, she suddenly spread out her hand, <b>and</b> made a snatch in <b>the</b> air. She did not get hold <b>of</b> anything, <b>but</b> she heard a little shriek <b>and</b> a fall, <b>and</b> a crash <b>of</b> broken glass, from which she concluded that <b>it</b> was just possible <b>it</b> had fallen <b>into</b> a cucumber-frame, <b>or</b> something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort.
<br>Next came an angry voice—<b>the</b> Rabbit's—`Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”
<br>“Digging for apples, indeed!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come <b>and</b> help me out <b>of</b> THIS!” (Sounds <b>of</b> more broken glass.)
<br>“Now tell me, Pat, what's that in <b>the</b> window?”
<br>“Sure, <b>it</b>'s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced <b>it</b> “arrum.')
<br>“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, <b>it</b> fills <b>the</b> whole window!”
<br>“Sure, <b>it</b> does, yer honour: <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s an arm for all that.”
<br>“Well, <b>it</b>'s got <b>no</b> business there, at any rate: go <b>and</b> take <b>it</b> away!”
<br>There was a long silence after this, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> could only hear whispers now <b>and</b> then; such as, “Sure, I don't like <b>it</b>, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” <b>and</b> at last she spread out her hand again, <b>and</b> made another snatch in <b>the</b> air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, <b>and</b> more sounds <b>of</b> broken glass. “What a number <b>of</b> cucumber-frames there must be!” thought <b>Alice</b>. “I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I don't want <b>to</b> stay in here any longer!”
<br>She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling <b>of</b> little cartwheels, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a good many voice all talking together: she made out <b>the</b> words: “Where's <b>the</b> other ladder?—Why, I hadn't <b>to</b> bring <b>but</b> one; Bill's got <b>the</b> other—Bill! fetch <b>it</b> here, lad!—Here, put 'em up at this corner—No, tie 'em together first—they don't reach half high enough yet—Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular- -Here, Bill! catch hold <b>of</b> this rope—Will <b>the</b> roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, <b>it</b>'s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—`Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who's <b>to</b> go down <b>the</b> chimney?—Nay, I shan't! YOU do <b>it</b>!—That I won't, then!—Bill's <b>to</b> go down—Here, Bill! <b>the</b> master says you're <b>to</b> go down <b>the</b> chimney!”
<br>“Oh! So Bill's got <b>to</b> come down <b>the</b> chimney, has he?” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself. “Shy, they seem <b>to</b> put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, <b>to</b> be sure; <b>but</b> I THINK I can kick a little!”
<br>She drew her foot as far down <b>the</b> chimney as she could, <b>and</b> waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess <b>of</b> what sort <b>it</b> was) scratching <b>and</b> scrambling about in <b>the</b> chimney close above her: then, saying <b>to</b> herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, <b>and</b> waited <b>to</b> see what would happen next.
<br>The first thing she heard was a general chorus <b>of</b> “There goes Bill!” then <b>the</b> Rabbit's voice along—`Catch him, you <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hedge!” then silence, <b>and</b> then another confusion <b>of</b> voices—`Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don't choke him—How was <b>it</b>, old fellow? What happened <b>to</b> you? Tell us all about <b>it</b>!”
<br>Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,” thought <b>Alice</b>,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I'm better now—<b>but</b> I'm a deal too flustered <b>to</b> tell you—all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-<b>the</b>-box, <b>and</b> up I goes like a sky-rocket!”
<br>“So you did, old fellow!” said <b>the</b> others.
<br>“We must burn <b>the</b> house down!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit's voice; <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> called out as loud as she could, “If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!”
<br>There was a dead silence instantly, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> thought <b>to</b> herself, “I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take <b>the</b> roof off.” After a minute <b>or</b> two, they began moving about again, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> heard <b>the</b> Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, <b>to</b> begin with.”
<br>“A barrowful <b>of</b> WHAT?” thought <b>Alice</b>; <b>but</b> she had not long <b>to</b> doubt, for <b>the</b> next moment a shower <b>of</b> little pebbles came rattling in at <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them hit her in <b>the</b> face. “I'll put a stop <b>to</b> this,” she said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> shouted out, “You'd better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.
<br><b>Alice</b> noticed with some surprise that <b>the</b> pebbles were all turning <b>into</b> little cakes as they lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> a bright idea came <b>into</b> her head. “If I eat one <b>of</b> these cakes,” she thought, “<b>it</b>'s sure <b>to</b> make SOME change in my size; <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> can't possibly make me larger, <b>it</b> must make me smaller, I suppose.”
<br>So she swallowed one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cakes, <b>and</b> was delighted <b>to</b> find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough <b>to</b> get through <b>the</b> door, she ran out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> found quite a crowd <b>of</b> little animals <b>and</b> birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in <b>the</b> middle, being held up <b>by</b> two guinea-pigs, who were giving <b>it</b> something out <b>of</b> a bottle. They all made a rush at <b>Alice</b> <b>the</b> moment she appeared; <b>but</b> she ran off as hard as she could, <b>and</b> soon found herself safe in a thick wood.
<br>“The first thing I've got <b>to</b> do,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, as she wandered about in <b>the</b> wood, “is <b>to</b> grow <b>to</b> my right size again; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second thing is <b>to</b> find my way <b>into</b> that lovely garden. I think that will be <b>the</b> best plan.”
<br>It sounded an excellent plan, <b>no</b> doubt, <b>and</b> very neatly <b>and</b> simply arranged; <b>the</b> only difficulty was, that she had not <b>the</b> smallest idea how <b>to</b> set about <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> while she was peering about anxiously among <b>the</b> trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.
<br>An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, <b>and</b> feebly stretching out one paw, trying <b>to</b> touch her. “Poor little thing!” said <b>Alice</b>, in a coaxing tone, <b>and</b> she tried hard <b>to</b> whistle <b>to</b> <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> she was terribly frightened all <b>the</b> time at <b>the</b> thought that <b>it</b> might be hungry, in which case <b>it</b> would be very likely <b>to</b> eat her up in spite <b>of</b> all her coaxing.
<br>Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit <b>of</b> stick, <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> puppy; whereupon <b>the</b> puppy jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air off all its feet at once, with a yelp <b>of</b> delight, <b>and</b> rushed at <b>the</b> stick, <b>and</b> made believe <b>to</b> worry <b>it</b>; then <b>Alice</b> dodged behind a great thistle, <b>to</b> keep herself from being run over; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moment she appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, <b>the</b> puppy made another rush at <b>the</b> stick, <b>and</b> tumbled head over heels in its hurry <b>to</b> get hold <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; then <b>Alice</b>, thinking <b>it</b> was very like having a game <b>of</b> play with a cart-horse, <b>and</b> expecting every moment <b>to</b> be trampled under its feet, ran round <b>the</b> thistle again; then <b>the</b> puppy began a series <b>of</b> short charges at <b>the</b> stick, running a very little way forwards each time <b>and</b> a long way back, <b>and</b> barking hoarsely all <b>the</b> while, till at last <b>it</b> sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out <b>of</b> its mouth, <b>and</b> its great eyes half shut.
<br>This seemed <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, <b>and</b> ran till she was quite tired <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> breath, <b>and</b> till <b>the</b> puppy's bark sounded quite faint in <b>the</b> distance.
<br>“And yet what a dear little puppy <b>it</b> was!” said <b>Alice</b>, as she leant against a buttercup <b>to</b> rest herself, <b>and</b> fanned herself with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves: “I should have liked teaching <b>it</b> tricks very much, if—if I'd only been <b>the</b> right size <b>to</b> do <b>it</b>! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got <b>to</b> grow up again! Let me see—how IS <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be managed? I suppose I ought <b>to</b> eat <b>or</b> drink something <b>or</b> other; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> great question is, what?”
<br>The great question certainly was, what? <b>Alice</b> looked all round her at <b>the</b> flowers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blades <b>of</b> grass, <b>but</b> she did not see anything that looked like <b>the</b> right thing <b>to</b> eat <b>or</b> drink under <b>the</b> circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about <b>the</b> same height as herself; <b>and</b> when she had looked under <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> both sides <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> occurred <b>to</b> her that she might as well look <b>and</b> see what was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>She stretched herself up <b>on</b> tiptoe, <b>and</b> peeped over <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> her eyes immediately met those <b>of</b> a large caterpillar, that was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, <b>and</b> taking not <b>the</b> smallest notice <b>of</b> her <b>or</b> <b>of</b> anything else.
<br>

<br>Chapter V
<br>ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR
<br>
<br>The Caterpillar <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked at each other for some time in silence: at last <b>the</b> Caterpillar took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth, <b>and</b> addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
<br>“Who are YOU?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. <b>Alice</b> replied, rather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present— at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, <b>but</b> I think I must have been changed several times since then.”
<br>“What do you mean <b>by</b> that?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”
<br>“I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir” said <b>Alice</b>, “because I'm not myself, you see.”
<br>“I don't see,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“I'm afraid I can't put <b>it</b> more clearly,” <b>Alice</b> replied very politely, “for I can't understand <b>it</b> myself <b>to</b> begin with; <b>and</b> being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”
<br>“It isn't,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, perhaps you haven't found <b>it</b> so yet,” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>but</b> when you have <b>to</b> turn <b>into</b> a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—<b>and</b> then after that <b>into</b> a butterfly, I should think you'll feel <b>it</b> a little queer, won't you?”
<br>“Not a bit,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said <b>Alice</b>; “all I know is, <b>it</b> would feel very queer <b>to</b> ME.”
<br>“You!” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are YOU?”
<br>Which brought them back again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conversation. <b>Alice</b> felt a little irritated at <b>the</b> Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, <b>and</b> she drew herself up <b>and</b> said, very gravely, “I think, you out <b>to</b> tell me who YOU are, first.”
<br>“Why?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>Here was another puzzling question; <b>and</b> as <b>Alice</b> could not think <b>of</b> any good reason, <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> Caterpillar seemed <b>to</b> be in a VERY unpleasant state <b>of</b> mind, she turned away.
<br>“Come back!” <b>the</b> Caterpillar called after her. “I've something important <b>to</b> say!”
<br>This sounded promising, certainly: <b>Alice</b> turned <b>and</b> came back again.
<br>“Keep your temper,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Is that all?” said <b>Alice</b>, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.
<br>“No,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else <b>to</b> do, <b>and</b> perhaps after all <b>it</b> might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes <b>it</b> puffed away without speaking, <b>but</b> at last <b>it</b> unfolded its arms, took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth again, <b>and</b> said, “So you think you're changed, do you?”
<br>“I'm afraid I am, sir,” said <b>Alice</b>; “I can't remember things as I used—<b>and</b> I don't keep <b>the</b> same size for ten minutes together!”
<br>“Can't remember WHAT things?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, I've tried <b>to</b> say «HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,» <b>but</b> <b>it</b> all came different!” <b>Alice</b> replied in a very melancholy voice.
<br>“Repeat, «YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"“ said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> folded her hands, <b>and</b> began:—
<br>“You are old, Father William,” <b>the</b> young man said,
<br>“And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand <b>on</b> your head—
<br>Do you think, at your age, <b>it</b> is right?”
<br>“In my youth,” Father William replied <b>to</b> his son,
<br>“I feared <b>it</b> might injure <b>the</b> brain; But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
<br>Why, I do <b>it</b> again <b>and</b> again.”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “as I mentioned before,
<br>And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault in at <b>the</b> door—
<br>Pray, what is <b>the</b> reason <b>of</b> that?”
<br>“In my youth,” said <b>the</b> sage, as he shook his grey locks,
<br>“I kept all my limbs very supple By <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this ointment—one shilling <b>the</b> box—
<br>Allow me <b>to</b> sell you a couple?”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “<b>and</b> your jaws are too weak
<br>For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished <b>the</b> goose, with <b>the</b> bones <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beak—
<br>Pray how did you manage <b>to</b> do <b>it</b>?”
<br>“In my youth,” said his father, “I took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law,
<br>And argued each case with my wife; And <b>the</b> muscular strength, which <b>it</b> gave <b>to</b> my jaw,
<br>Has lasted <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> my life.”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “one would hardly suppose
<br>That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your nose—
<br>What made you so awfully clever?”
<br>“I have answered three questions, <b>and</b> that is enough,”
<br>Said his father; “don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day <b>to</b> such stuff?
<br>Be off, <b>or</b> I'll kick you down stairs!”
<br>“That is not said right,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,” said <b>Alice</b>, timidly; some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words have got altered.”
<br>“It is wrong from beginning <b>to</b> end,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar decidedly, <b>and</b> there was silence for some minutes.
<br>The Caterpillar was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> speak.
<br>“What size do you want <b>to</b> be?” <b>it</b> asked.
<br>“Oh, I'm not particular as <b>to</b> size,” <b>Alice</b> hastily replied; “only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.”
<br>“I DON'T know,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, <b>and</b> she felt that she was losing her temper.
<br>“Are you content now?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, I should like <b>to</b> be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,” said <b>Alice</b>: “three inches is such a wretched height <b>to</b> be.”
<br>“It is a very good height indeed!” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as <b>it</b> spoke (<b>it</b> was exactly three inches high).
<br>“But I'm not used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>!” pleaded poor <b>Alice</b> in a piteous tone. And she thought <b>of</b> herself, “I wish <b>the</b> creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!”
<br>“You'll get used <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in time,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> put <b>the</b> hookah <b>into</b> its mouth <b>and</b> began smoking again.
<br>This time <b>Alice</b> waited patiently until <b>it</b> chose <b>to</b> speak again. In a minute <b>or</b> two <b>the</b> Caterpillar took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth <b>and</b> yawned once <b>or</b> twice, <b>and</b> shook itself. Then <b>it</b> got down off <b>the</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> crawled away in <b>the</b> grass, merely remarking as <b>it</b> went, “One side will make you grow taller, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other side will make you grow shorter.”
<br>“One side <b>of</b> WHAT? The other side <b>of</b> WHAT?” thought <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself.
<br>“Of <b>the</b> mushroom,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar, just as if she had asked <b>it</b> aloud; <b>and</b> in another moment <b>it</b> was out <b>of</b> sight.
<br><b>Alice</b> remained looking thoughtfully at <b>the</b> mushroom for a minute, trying <b>to</b> make out which were <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round <b>it</b> as far as they would go, <b>and</b> broke off a bit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge with each hand.
<br>“And now which is which?” she said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> nibbled a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-hand bit <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> effect: <b>the</b> next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: <b>it</b> had struck her foot!
<br>She was a good deal frightened <b>by</b> this very sudden change, <b>but</b> she felt that there was <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set <b>to</b> work at once <b>to</b> eat some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room <b>to</b> open her mouth; <b>but</b> she did <b>it</b> at last, <b>and</b> managed <b>to</b> swallow a morsel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lefthand bit.
<br>“Come, my head's free at last!” said <b>Alice</b> in a tone <b>of</b> delight, which changed <b>into</b> alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere <b>to</b> be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length <b>of</b> neck, which seemed <b>to</b> rise like a stalk out <b>of</b> a sea <b>of</b> green leaves that lay far below her.
<br>“What CAN all that green stuff be?” said <b>Alice</b>. “And where HAVE my shoulders got <b>to</b>? And oh, my poor hands, how is <b>it</b> I can't see you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> result seemed <b>to</b> follow, except a little shaking among <b>the</b> distant green leaves.
<br>As there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> getting her hands up <b>to</b> her head, she tried <b>to</b> get her head down <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> was delighted <b>to</b> find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving <b>it</b> down <b>into</b> a graceful zigzag, <b>and</b> was going <b>to</b> dive in among <b>the</b> leaves, which she found <b>to</b> be nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown <b>into</b> her face, <b>and</b> was beating her violently with its wings.
<br>“Serpent!” screamed <b>the</b> Pigeon.
<br>“I'm NOT a serpent!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly. “Let me alone!”
<br>“Serpent, I say again!” repeated <b>the</b> Pigeon, <b>but</b> in a more subdued tone, <b>and</b> added with a kind <b>of</b> sob, “I've tried every way, <b>and</b> nothing seems <b>to</b> suit them!”
<br>“I haven't <b>the</b> least idea what you're talking about,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“I've tried <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> I've tried banks, <b>and</b> I've tried hedges,” <b>the</b> Pigeon went <b>on</b>, without attending <b>to</b> her; “<b>but</b> those serpents! There's <b>no</b> pleasing them!”
<br><b>Alice</b> was more <b>and</b> more puzzled, <b>but</b> she thought there was <b>no</b> use in saying anything more till <b>the</b> Pigeon had finished.
<br>“As if <b>it</b> wasn't trouble enough hatching <b>the</b> eggs,” said <b>the</b> Pigeon; “<b>but</b> I must be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> look-out for serpents night <b>and</b> day! Why, I haven't had a wink <b>of</b> sleep these three weeks!”
<br>“I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,” said <b>Alice</b>, who was beginning <b>to</b> see its meaning.
<br>“And just as I'd taken <b>the</b> highest tree in <b>the</b> wood,” continued <b>the</b> Pigeon, raising its voice <b>to</b> a shriek, “<b>and</b> just as I was thinking I should be free <b>of</b> them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from <b>the</b> sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
<br>“But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!” said <b>Alice</b>. “I'm a—I'm a—”
<br>“Well! WHAT are you?” said <b>the</b> Pigeon. “I can see you're trying <b>to</b> invent something!”
<br>“I—I'm a little girl,” said <b>Alice</b>, rather doubtfully, as she remembered <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> changes she had gone through that day.
<br>“A likely story indeed!” said <b>the</b> Pigeon in a tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deepest contempt. “I've seen a good many little girls in my time, <b>but</b> never ONE with such a neck as that! No, <b>no</b>! You're a serpent; <b>and</b> there's <b>no</b> use denying <b>it</b>. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”
<br>“I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b>, who was a very truthful child; “<b>but</b> little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.”
<br>“I don't believe <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Pigeon; “<b>but</b> if they do, why then they're a kind <b>of</b> serpent, that's all I can say.”
<br>This was such a new idea <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, that she was quite silent for a minute <b>or</b> two, which gave <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> adding, “You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; <b>and</b> what does <b>it</b> matter <b>to</b> me whether you're a little girl <b>or</b> a serpent?”
<br>“It matters a good deal <b>to</b> ME,” said <b>Alice</b> hastily; “<b>but</b> I'm not looking for eggs, as <b>it</b> happens; <b>and</b> if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them raw.”
<br>“Well, be off, then!” said <b>the</b> Pigeon in a sulky tone, as <b>it</b> settled down again <b>into</b> its nest. <b>Alice</b> crouched down among <b>the</b> trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among <b>the</b> branches, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then she had <b>to</b> stop <b>and</b> untwist <b>it</b>. After a while she remembered that she still held <b>the</b> pieces <b>of</b> mushroom in her hands, <b>and</b> she set <b>to</b> work very carefully, nibbling first at one <b>and</b> then at <b>the</b> other, <b>and</b> growing sometimes taller <b>and</b> sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down <b>to</b> her usual height.
<br>It was so long since she had been anything near <b>the</b> right size, that <b>it</b> felt quite strange at first; <b>but</b> she got used <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in a few minutes, <b>and</b> began talking <b>to</b> herself, as usual. “Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going <b>to</b> be, from one minute <b>to</b> another! However, I've got back <b>to</b> my right size: <b>the</b> next thing is, <b>to</b> get <b>into</b> that beautiful garden—how IS that <b>to</b> be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in <b>it</b> about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b>'ll never do <b>to</b> come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out <b>of</b> their wits!” So she began nibbling at <b>the</b> righthand bit again, <b>and</b> did not venture <b>to</b> go near <b>the</b> house till she had brought herself down <b>to</b> nine inches high.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter VI
<br>PIG AND PEPPER
<br>
<br>For a minute <b>or</b> two she stood looking at <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> wondering what <b>to</b> do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood—(she considered him <b>to</b> be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging <b>by</b> his face only, she would have called him a fish)—<b>and</b> rapped loudly at <b>the</b> door with his knuckles. It was opened <b>by</b> another footman in livery, with a round face, <b>and</b> large eyes like a frog; <b>and</b> both footmen, <b>Alice</b> noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious <b>to</b> know what <b>it</b> was all about, <b>and</b> crept a little way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>to</b> listen.
<br>The Fish-Footman began <b>by</b> producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, <b>and</b> this he handed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For <b>the</b> Duchess. An invitation from <b>the</b> Queen <b>to</b> play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in <b>the</b> same solemn tone, only changing <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words a little, “From <b>the</b> Queen. An invitation for <b>the</b> Duchess <b>to</b> play croquet.”
<br>Then they both bowed low, <b>and</b> their curls got entangled together.
<br><b>Alice</b> laughed so much at this, that she had <b>to</b> run back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood for fear <b>of</b> their hearing her; <b>and</b> when she next peeped out <b>the</b> Fish-Footman was gone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground near <b>the</b> door, staring stupidly up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky.
<br><b>Alice</b> went timidly up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> knocked.
<br>“There's <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> use in knocking,” said <b>the</b> Footman, “<b>and</b> that for two reasons. First, because I'm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, <b>no</b> one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going <b>on</b> within—a constant howling <b>and</b> sneezing, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then a great crash, as if a dish <b>or</b> kettle had been broken <b>to</b> pieces.
<br>“Please, then,” said <b>Alice</b>, “how am I <b>to</b> get in?”
<br>“There might be some sense in your knocking,” <b>the</b> Footman went <b>on</b> without attending <b>to</b> her, “if we had <b>the</b> door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, <b>and</b> I could let you out, you know.” He was looking up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky all <b>the</b> time he was speaking, <b>and</b> this <b>Alice</b> thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can't help <b>it</b>,” she said <b>to</b> herself; “his eyes are so VERY nearly at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I <b>to</b> get in?” she repeated, aloud.
<br>“I shall sit here,” <b>the</b> Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
<br>At this moment <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house opened, <b>and</b> a large plate came skimming out, straight at <b>the</b> Footman's head: <b>it</b> just grazed his nose, <b>and</b> broke <b>to</b> pieces against one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees behind him.
<br>“—<b>or</b> next day, maybe,” <b>the</b> Footman continued in <b>the</b> same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.
<br>“How am I <b>to</b> get in?” asked <b>Alice</b> again, in a louder tone.
<br>“ARE you <b>to</b> get in at all?” said <b>the</b> Footman. “That's <b>the</b> first question, you know.”
<br>It was, <b>no</b> doubt: only <b>Alice</b> did not like <b>to</b> be told so. “It's really dreadful,” she muttered <b>to</b> herself, “<b>the</b> way all <b>the</b> creatures argue. It's enough <b>to</b> drive one crazy!”
<br>The Footman seemed <b>to</b> think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “<b>on</b> <b>and</b> off, for days <b>and</b> days.”
<br>“But what am I <b>to</b> do?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Anything you like” said <b>the</b> Footman, <b>and</b> began whistling.
<br>“Oh, there's <b>no</b> use in talking <b>to</b> him,” said <b>Alice</b> desperately: “he's perfectly idiotic!” And she opened <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> went in.
<br>The door led right <b>into</b> a large kitchen, which was full <b>of</b> smoke from one end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other: <b>the</b> Duchess was sitting <b>on</b> a three-legged stool in <b>the</b> middle, nursing a baby; <b>the</b> cook was leaning over <b>the</b> fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed <b>to</b> be full <b>of</b> soup.
<br>“There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> herself, as well as she could for sneezing.
<br>There was certainly too much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in <b>the</b> air. Even <b>the</b> Duchess sneezed occasionally; <b>and</b> as for <b>the</b> baby, <b>it</b> was sneezing <b>and</b> howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in <b>the</b> kitchen that did not sneeze, were <b>the</b> cook, <b>and</b> a large cat which was sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth <b>and</b> grinning from ear <b>to</b> ear.
<br>“Please would you tell me,” said <b>Alice</b>, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether <b>it</b> was good manners for her <b>to</b> speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”
<br>“It's a Cheshire cat,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “<b>and</b> that's why. Pig!”
<br>She said <b>the</b> last word with such sudden violence that <b>Alice</b> quite jumped; <b>but</b> she saw in another moment that <b>it</b> was addressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> baby, <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> her, so she took courage, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> again:—
<br>I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.”
<br>“They all can,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> most <b>of</b> 'em do.”
<br>“I don't know <b>of</b> any that do,” <b>Alice</b> said very politely, feeling quite pleased <b>to</b> have got <b>into</b> a conversation.
<br>“You don't know much,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> that's a fact.”
<br><b>Alice</b> did not at all like <b>the</b> tone <b>of</b> this remark, <b>and</b> thought <b>it</b> would be as well <b>to</b> introduce some other subject <b>of</b> conversation. While she was trying <b>to</b> fix <b>on</b> one, <b>the</b> cook took <b>the</b> cauldron <b>of</b> soup off <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> at once set <b>to</b> work throwing everything within her reach at <b>the</b> Duchess <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby- -<b>the</b> fire-irons came first; then followed a shower <b>of</b> saucepans, plates, <b>and</b> dishes. The Duchess took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> them even when they hit her; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby was howling so much already, that <b>it</b> was quite impossible <b>to</b> say whether <b>the</b> blows hurt <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not.
<br>“Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!” cried <b>Alice</b>, jumping up <b>and</b> down in an agony <b>of</b> terror. “Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> very nearly carried <b>it</b> off.
<br>“If everybody minded their own business,” <b>the</b> Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “<b>the</b> world would go round a deal faster than <b>it</b> does.”
<br>“Which would NOT be an advantage,” said <b>Alice</b>, who felt very glad <b>to</b> get an opportunity <b>of</b> showing off a little <b>of</b> her knowledge. “Just think <b>of</b> what work <b>it</b> would make with <b>the</b> day <b>and</b> night! You see <b>the</b> earth takes twenty-four hours <b>to</b> turn round <b>on</b> its axis—”
<br>“Talking <b>of</b> axes,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “chop off her head!”
<br><b>Alice</b> glanced rather anxiously at <b>the</b> cook, <b>to</b> see if she meant <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> hint; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> cook was busily stirring <b>the</b> soup, <b>and</b> seemed not <b>to</b> be listening, so she went <b>on</b> again: “Twenty-four hours, I THINK; <b>or</b> is <b>it</b> twelve? I—”
<br>“Oh, don't bother ME,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “I never could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort <b>of</b> lullaby <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as she did so, <b>and</b> giving <b>it</b> a violent shake at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> every line:
<br>
<br>“Speak roughly <b>to</b> your little boy,
<br>And beat him when he sneezes:
<br>He only does <b>it</b> <b>to</b> annoy,
<br>Because he knows <b>it</b> teases.”
<br>
<br>CHORUS.
<br>(In which <b>the</b> cook <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby joined):—
<br>“Wow! wow! wow!”
<br>
<br>While <b>the</b> Duchess sang <b>the</b> second verse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, she kept tossing <b>the</b> baby violently up <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor little thing howled so, that <b>Alice</b> could hardly hear <b>the</b> words:—
<br>
<br>“I speak severely <b>to</b> my boy,
<br>I beat him when he sneezes;
<br>For he can thoroughly enjoy
<br>The pepper when he pleases!”
<br>
<br>CHORUS.
<br>“Wow! wow! wow!”
<br>
<br>“Here! you may nurse <b>it</b> a bit, if you like!” <b>the</b> Duchess said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, flinging <b>the</b> baby at her as she spoke. “I must go <b>and</b> get ready <b>to</b> play croquet with <b>the</b> Queen,” <b>and</b> she hurried out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> just missed her.
<br><b>Alice</b> caught <b>the</b> baby with some difficulty, as <b>it</b> was a queer- shaped little creature, <b>and</b> held out its arms <b>and</b> legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought <b>Alice</b>. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> kept doubling itself up <b>and</b> straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for <b>the</b> first minute <b>or</b> two, <b>it</b> was as much as she could do <b>to</b> hold <b>it</b>.
<br>As soon as she had made out <b>the</b> proper way <b>of</b> nursing <b>it</b>, (which was <b>to</b> twist <b>it</b> up <b>into</b> a sort <b>of</b> knot, <b>and</b> then keep tight hold <b>of</b> its right ear <b>and</b> left foot, so as <b>to</b> prevent its undoing itself,) she carried <b>it</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open air. “IF I don't take this child away with me,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “they're sure <b>to</b> kill <b>it</b> in a day <b>or</b> two: wouldn't <b>it</b> be murder <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b> behind?” She said <b>the</b> last words out loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little thing grunted in reply (<b>it</b> had left off sneezing <b>by</b> this time). “Don't grunt,” said <b>Alice</b>; “that's not at all a proper way <b>of</b> expressing yourself.”
<br>The baby grunted again, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked very anxiously <b>into</b> its face <b>to</b> see what was <b>the</b> matter with <b>it</b>. There could be <b>no</b> doubt that <b>it</b> had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether <b>Alice</b> did not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing at all. “But perhaps <b>it</b> was only sobbing,” she thought, <b>and</b> looked <b>into</b> its eyes again, <b>to</b> see if there were any tears.
<br>No, there were <b>no</b> tears. “If you're going <b>to</b> turn <b>into</b> a pig, my dear,” said <b>Alice</b>, seriously, “I'll have nothing more <b>to</b> do with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (<b>or</b> grunted, <b>it</b> was impossible <b>to</b> say which), <b>and</b> they went <b>on</b> for some while in silence.
<br><b>Alice</b> was just beginning <b>to</b> think <b>to</b> herself, “Now, what am I <b>to</b> do with this creature when I get <b>it</b> home?” when <b>it</b> grunted again, so violently, that she looked down <b>into</b> its face in some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about <b>it</b>: <b>it</b> was neither more nor less than a pig, <b>and</b> she felt that <b>it</b> would be quite absurd for her <b>to</b> carry <b>it</b> further.
<br>So she set <b>the</b> little creature down, <b>and</b> felt quite relieved <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> trot away quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood. “If <b>it</b> had grown up,” she said <b>to</b> herself, “<b>it</b> would have made a dreadfully ugly child: <b>but</b> <b>it</b> makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, <b>and</b> was just saying <b>to</b> herself, “if one only knew <b>the</b> right way <b>to</b> change them—” when she was a little startled <b>by</b> seeing <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat sitting <b>on</b> a bough <b>of</b> a tree a few yards off.
<br>The Cat only grinned when <b>it</b> saw <b>Alice</b>. It looked good- natured, she thought: still <b>it</b> had VERY long claws <b>and</b> a great many teeth, so she felt that <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be treated with respect.
<br>“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether <b>it</b> would like <b>the</b> name: however, <b>it</b> only grinned a little wider. “Come, <b>it</b>'s pleased so far,” thought <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> she went <b>on</b>. “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought <b>to</b> go from here?”
<br>“That depends a good deal <b>on</b> where you want <b>to</b> get <b>to</b>,” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“I don't much care where—” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> doesn't matter which way you go,” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“—so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” <b>Alice</b> added as an explanation.
<br>“Oh, you're sure <b>to</b> do that,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”
<br><b>Alice</b> felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. “What sort <b>of</b> people live about here?”
<br>“In THAT direction,” <b>the</b> Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: <b>and</b> in THAT direction,” waving <b>the</b> other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.”
<br>“But I don't want <b>to</b> go among mad people,” <b>Alice</b> remarked.
<br>“Oh, you can't help that,” said <b>the</b> Cat: “we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.”
<br>“How do you know I'm mad?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You must be,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “<b>or</b> you wouldn't have come here.”
<br><b>Alice</b> didn't think that proved <b>it</b> at all; however, she went <b>on</b> “And how do you know that you're mad?”
<br>“To begin with,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “a dog's not mad. You grant that?”
<br>“I suppose so,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Well, then,” <b>the</b> Cat went <b>on</b>, “you see, a dog growls when <b>it</b>'s angry, <b>and</b> wags its tail when <b>it</b>'s pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, <b>and</b> wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.”
<br>“I call <b>it</b> purring, not growling,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Call <b>it</b> what you like,” said <b>the</b> Cat. “Do you play croquet with <b>the</b> Queen <b>to</b>-day?”
<br>“I should like <b>it</b> very much,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>but</b> I haven't been invited yet.”
<br>“You'll see me there,” said <b>the</b> Cat, <b>and</b> vanished.
<br><b>Alice</b> was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used <b>to</b> queer things happening. While she was looking at <b>the</b> place where <b>it</b> had been, <b>it</b> suddenly appeared again.
<br>“By-<b>the</b>-bye, what became <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby?” said <b>the</b> Cat. “I'd nearly forgotten <b>to</b> ask.”
<br>“It turned <b>into</b> a pig,” <b>Alice</b> quietly said, just as if <b>it</b> had come back in a natural way.
<br>“I thought <b>it</b> would,” said <b>the</b> Cat, <b>and</b> vanished again.
<br><b>Alice</b> waited a little, half expecting <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> again, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not appear, <b>and</b> after a minute <b>or</b> two she walked <b>on</b> in <b>the</b> direction in which <b>the</b> March Hare was said <b>to</b> live. “I've seen hatters before,” she said <b>to</b> herself; “<b>the</b> March Hare will be much <b>the</b> most interesting, <b>and</b> perhaps as this is May <b>it</b> won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as <b>it</b> was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, <b>and</b> there was <b>the</b> Cat again, sitting <b>on</b> a branch <b>of</b> a tree.
<br>“Did you say pig, <b>or</b> fig?” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“I said pig,” replied <b>Alice</b>; “<b>and</b> I wish you wouldn't keep appearing <b>and</b> vanishing so suddenly: you make <b>on</b> quite giddy.”
<br>“All right,” said <b>the</b> Cat; <b>and</b> this time <b>it</b> vanished quite slowly, beginning with <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail, <b>and</b> ending with <b>the</b> grin, which remained some time after <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>it</b> had gone.
<br>“Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,” thought <b>Alice</b>; “<b>but</b> a grin without a cat! It's <b>the</b> most curious thing I ever say in my life!”
<br>She had not gone much farther before she came in sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> March Hare: she thought <b>it</b> must be <b>the</b> right house, because <b>the</b> chimneys were shaped like ears <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like <b>to</b> go nearer till she had nibbled some more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lefthand bit <b>of</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> raised herself <b>to</b> about two feet high: even then she walked up towards <b>it</b> rather timidly, saying <b>to</b> herself “Suppose <b>it</b> should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Hatter instead!”
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter VII
<br>A MAD TEA-PARTY
<br>
<br>There was a table set out under a tree in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> March Hare <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hatter were having tea at <b>it</b>: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two were using <b>it</b> as a cushion, resting their elbows <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for <b>the</b> Dormouse,” thought <b>Alice</b>; “only, as <b>it</b>'s asleep, I suppose <b>it</b> doesn't mind.”
<br>The table was a large one, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> three were all crowded together at one corner <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw <b>Alice</b> coming. “There's PLENTY <b>of</b> room!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly, <b>and</b> she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table.
<br>“Have some wine,” <b>the</b> March Hare said in an encouraging tone.
<br><b>Alice</b> looked all round <b>the</b> table, <b>but</b> there was nothing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> tea. “I don't see any wine,” she remarked.
<br>“There isn't any,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> wasn't very civil <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> offer <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b> angrily.
<br>“It wasn't very civil <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> sit down without being invited,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“I didn't know <b>it</b> was YOUR table,” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>it</b>'s laid for a great many more than three.”
<br>“Your hair wants cutting,” said <b>the</b> Hatter. He had been looking at <b>Alice</b> for some time with great curiosity, <b>and</b> this was his first speech.
<br>“You should learn not <b>to</b> make personal remarks,” <b>Alice</b> said with some severity; “<b>it</b>'s very rude.”
<br>The Hatter opened his eyes very wide <b>on</b> hearing this; <b>but</b> all he SAID was, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”
<br>“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought <b>Alice</b>. “I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.
<br>“Do you mean that you think you can find out <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Exactly so,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Then you should say what you mean,” <b>the</b> March Hare went <b>on</b>.
<br>“I do,” <b>Alice</b> hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I say—that's <b>the</b> same thing, you know.”
<br>“Not <b>the</b> same thing a bit!” said <b>the</b> Hatter. “You might just as well say that «I see what I eat» is <b>the</b> same thing as «I eat what I see»!”
<br>“You might just as well say,” added <b>the</b> March Hare, “that «I like what I get» is <b>the</b> same thing as «I get what I like»!”
<br>“You might just as well say,” added <b>the</b> Dormouse, who seemed <b>to</b> be talking in his sleep, “that «I breathe when I sleep» is <b>the</b> same thing as «I sleep when I breathe»!”
<br>“It IS <b>the</b> same thing with you,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b> here <b>the</b> conversation dropped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party sat silent for a minute, while <b>Alice</b> thought over all she could remember about ravens <b>and</b> writing-desks, which wasn't much.
<br>The Hatter was <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> silence. “What day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month is <b>it</b>?” he said, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>: he had taken his watch out <b>of</b> his pocket, <b>and</b> was looking at <b>it</b> uneasily, shaking <b>it</b> every now <b>and</b> then, <b>and</b> holding <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his ear.
<br><b>Alice</b> considered a little, <b>and</b> then said “The fourth.”
<br>“Two days wrong!” sighed <b>the</b> Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn't suit <b>the</b> works!” he added looking angrily at <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“It was <b>the</b> BEST butter,” <b>the</b> March Hare meekly replied.
<br>“Yes, <b>but</b> some crumbs must have got in as well,” <b>the</b> Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn't have put <b>it</b> in with <b>the</b> bread-knife.”
<br>The March Hare took <b>the</b> watch <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> gloomily: then he dipped <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his cup <b>of</b> tea, <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> again: <b>but</b> he could think <b>of</b> nothing better <b>to</b> say than his first remark, “It was <b>the</b> BEST butter, you know.”
<br><b>Alice</b> had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a funny watch!” she remarked. “It tells <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month, <b>and</b> doesn't tell what o'clock <b>it</b> is!”
<br>“Why should <b>it</b>?” muttered <b>the</b> Hatter. “Does YOUR watch tell you what year <b>it</b> is?”
<br>“Of course not,” <b>Alice</b> replied very readily: “<b>but</b> that's because <b>it</b> stays <b>the</b> same year for such a long time together.”
<br>“Which is just <b>the</b> case with MINE,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br><b>Alice</b> felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed <b>to</b> have <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> meaning in <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> was certainly English. “I don't quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she could.
<br>“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b> he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
<br>The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, <b>and</b> said, without opening its eyes, “Of course, <b>of</b> course; just what I was going <b>to</b> remark myself.”
<br>“Have you guessed <b>the</b> riddle yet?” <b>the</b> Hatter said, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> again.
<br>“No, I give <b>it</b> up,” <b>Alice</b> replied: “that's <b>the</b> answer?”
<br>“I haven't <b>the</b> slightest idea,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“Nor I,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br><b>Alice</b> sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with <b>the</b> time,” she said, “than waste <b>it</b> in asking riddles that have <b>no</b> answers.”
<br>“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, “you wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.”
<br>“I don't know what you mean,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Of course you don't!” <b>the</b> Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke <b>to</b> Time!”
<br>“Perhaps not,” <b>Alice</b> cautiously replied: “<b>but</b> I know I have <b>to</b> beat time when I learn music.”
<br>“Ah! that accounts for <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Hatter. “He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept <b>on</b> good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with <b>the</b> clock. For instance, suppose <b>it</b> were nine o'clock in <b>the</b> morning, just time <b>to</b> begin lessons: you'd only have <b>to</b> whisper a hint <b>to</b> Time, <b>and</b> round goes <b>the</b> clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”
<br>(`I only wish <b>it</b> was,” <b>the</b> March Hare said <b>to</b> itself in a whisper.)
<br>“That would be grand, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b> thoughtfully: “<b>but</b> then—I shouldn't be hungry for <b>it</b>, you know.”
<br>“Not at first, perhaps,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “<b>but</b> you could keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> half-past one as long as you liked.”
<br>“Is that <b>the</b> way YOU manage?” <b>Alice</b> asked.
<br>The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just before HE went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at <b>the</b> March Hare,) “—<b>it</b> was at <b>the</b> great concert given <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Queen <b>of</b> Hearts, <b>and</b> I had <b>to</b> sing
<br>
<br>«Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
<br>How I wonder what you're at!»
<br>
<br>You know <b>the</b> song, perhaps?”
<br>“I've heard something like <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“It goes <b>on</b>, you know,” <b>the</b> Hatter continued, “in this way:—
<br>
<br>«Up above <b>the</b> world you fly,
<br>Like a tea-tray in <b>the</b> sky.
<br>Twinkle, twinkle—"“
<br>
<br>Here <b>the</b> Dormouse shook itself, <b>and</b> began singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> so long that they had <b>to</b> pinch <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> stop.
<br>“Well, I'd hardly finished <b>the</b> first verse,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, “when <b>the</b> Queen jumped up <b>and</b> bawled out, «He's murdering <b>the</b> time! Off with his head!"“
<br>“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“And ever since that,” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b> in a mournful tone, “he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.”
<br>A bright idea came <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s head. “Is that <b>the</b> reason so many tea-things are put out here?” she asked.
<br>“Yes, that's <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Hatter with a sigh: “<b>it</b>'s always tea-time, <b>and</b> we've <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> wash <b>the</b> things between whiles.”
<br>“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Exactly so,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “as <b>the</b> things get used up.”
<br>“But what happens when you come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning again?” <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> ask.
<br>“Suppose we change <b>the</b> subject,” <b>the</b> March Hare interrupted, yawning. “I'm getting tired <b>of</b> this. I vote <b>the</b> young lady tells us a story.”
<br>“I'm afraid I don't know one,” said <b>Alice</b>, rather alarmed at <b>the</b> proposal.
<br>“Then <b>the</b> Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And they pinched <b>it</b> <b>on</b> both sides at once.
<br>The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn't asleep,” he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”
<br>“Tell us a story!” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Yes, please do!” pleaded <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“And be quick about <b>it</b>,” added <b>the</b> Hatter, “<b>or</b> you'll be asleep again before <b>it</b>'s done.”
<br>“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” <b>the</b> Dormouse began in a great hurry; “<b>and</b> their names were Elsie, Lacie, <b>and</b> Tillie; <b>and</b> they lived at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well—”
<br>“What did they live <b>on</b>?” said <b>Alice</b>, who always took a great interest in questions <b>of</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking.
<br>“They lived <b>on</b> treacle,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, after thinking a minute <b>or</b> two.
<br>“They couldn't have done that, you know,” <b>Alice</b> gently remarked; “they'd have been ill.”
<br>“So they were,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse; “VERY ill.”
<br><b>Alice</b> tried <b>to</b> fancy <b>to</b> herself what such an extraordinary ways <b>of</b> living would be like, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> puzzled her too much, so she went <b>on</b>: “But why did they live at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well?”
<br>“Take some more tea,” <b>the</b> March Hare said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, very earnestly.
<br>“I've had nothing yet,” <b>Alice</b> replied in an offended tone, “so I can't take more.”
<br>“You mean you can't take LESS,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “<b>it</b>'s very easy <b>to</b> take MORE than nothing.”
<br>“Nobody asked YOUR opinion,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Who's making personal remarks now?” <b>the</b> Hatter asked triumphantly.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not quite know what <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> this: so she helped herself <b>to</b> some tea <b>and</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter, <b>and</b> then turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse, <b>and</b> repeated her question. “Why did they live at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well?”
<br>The Dormouse again took a minute <b>or</b> two <b>to</b> think about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then said, “It was a treacle-well.”
<br>“There's <b>no</b> such thing!” <b>Alice</b> was beginning very angrily, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hatter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> March Hare went “Sh! sh!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If you can't be civil, you'd better finish <b>the</b> story for yourself.”
<br>“No, please go <b>on</b>!” <b>Alice</b> said very humbly; “I won't interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.”
<br>“One, indeed!” said <b>the</b> Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning <b>to</b> draw, you know—”
<br>“What did they draw?” said <b>Alice</b>, quite forgetting her promise.
<br>“Treacle,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
<br>“I want a clean cup,” interrupted <b>the</b> Hatter: “let's all move one place <b>on</b>.”
<br>He moved <b>on</b> as he spoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse followed him: <b>the</b> March Hare moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse's place, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> rather unwillingly took <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> March Hare. The Hatter was <b>the</b> only one who got any advantage from <b>the</b> change: <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> was a good deal worse off than before, as <b>the</b> March Hare had just upset <b>the</b> milk-jug <b>into</b> his plate.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not wish <b>to</b> offend <b>the</b> Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: “But I don't understand. Where did they draw <b>the</b> treacle from?”
<br>“You can draw water out <b>of</b> a water-well,” said <b>the</b> Hatter; “so I should think you could draw treacle out <b>of</b> a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
<br>“But they were IN <b>the</b> well,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse, not choosing <b>to</b> notice this last remark.
<br>“Of course they were', said <b>the</b> Dormouse; “—well in.”
<br>This answer so confused poor <b>Alice</b>, that she let <b>the</b> Dormouse go <b>on</b> for some time without interrupting <b>it</b>.
<br>“They were learning <b>to</b> draw,” <b>the</b> Dormouse went <b>on</b>, yawning <b>and</b> rubbing its eyes, for <b>it</b> was getting very sleepy; “<b>and</b> they drew all manner <b>of</b> things—everything that begins with an M—”
<br>“Why with an M?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why not?” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br><b>Alice</b> was silent.
<br>The Dormouse had closed its eyes <b>by</b> this time, <b>and</b> was going off <b>into</b> a doze; <b>but</b>, <b>on</b> being pinched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>it</b> woke up again with a little shriek, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b>: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moon, <b>and</b> memory, <b>and</b> muchness— you know you say things are «much <b>of</b> a muchness"—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing <b>of</b> a muchness?”
<br>“Really, now you ask me,” said <b>Alice</b>, very much confused, “I don't think—”
<br>“Then you shouldn't talk,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>This piece <b>of</b> rudeness was more than <b>Alice</b> could bear: she got up in great disgust, <b>and</b> walked off; <b>the</b> Dormouse fell asleep instantly, <b>and</b> neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others took <b>the</b> least notice <b>of</b> her going, though she looked back once <b>or</b> twice, half hoping that they would call after her: <b>the</b> last time she saw them, they were trying <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> Dormouse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> teapot.
<br>“At any rate I'll never go THERE again!” said <b>Alice</b> as she picked her way through <b>the</b> wood. “It's <b>the</b> stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!”
<br>Just as she said this, she noticed that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees had a door leading right <b>into</b> <b>it</b>. “That's very curious!” she thought. “But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And in she went.
<br>Once more she found herself in <b>the</b> long hall, <b>and</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little glass table. “Now, I'll manage better this time,” she said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> began <b>by</b> taking <b>the</b> little golden key, <b>and</b> unlocking <b>the</b> door that led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden. Then she wet <b>to</b> work nibbling at <b>the</b> mushroom (she had kept a piece <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in her pocked) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down <b>the</b> little passage: <b>and</b> THEN—she found herself at last in <b>the</b> beautiful garden, among <b>the</b> bright flower-beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cool fountains.
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter VIII
<br>THE QUEEN'S CROQUET-GROUND
<br>
<br>A large rose-tree stood near <b>the</b> entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden: <b>the</b> roses growing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> were white, <b>but</b> there were three gardeners at <b>it</b>, busily painting them red. <b>Alice</b> thought this a very curious thing, <b>and</b> she went nearer <b>to</b> watch them, <b>and</b> just as she came up <b>to</b> them she heard one <b>of</b> them say, “Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!”
<br>“I couldn't help <b>it</b>,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”
<br>On which Seven looked up <b>and</b> said, “That's right, Five! Always lay <b>the</b> blame <b>on</b> others!”
<br>“YOU'D better not talk!'said Five. “I heard <b>the</b> Queen say only yesterday you deserved <b>to</b> be beheaded!”
<br>“What for?” said <b>the</b> one who had spoken first.
<br>“That's none <b>of</b> YOUR business, Two!” said Seven.
<br>“Yes, <b>it</b> IS his business!” said Five, “<b>and</b> I'll tell him—<b>it</b> was for bringing <b>the</b> cook tulip-roots instead <b>of</b> onions.”
<br>Seven flung down his brush, <b>and</b> had just begun “Well, <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> unjust things—” when his eye chanced <b>to</b> fall upon <b>Alice</b>, as she stood watching them, <b>and</b> he checked himself suddenly: <b>the</b> others looked round also, <b>and</b> all <b>of</b> them bowed low.
<br>“Would you tell me,” said <b>Alice</b>, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”
<br>Five <b>and</b> Seven said nothing, <b>but</b> looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why <b>the</b> fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought <b>to</b> have been a RED rose-tree, <b>and</b> we put a white one in <b>by</b> mistake; <b>and</b> if <b>the</b> Queen was <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, <b>to</b>—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across <b>the</b> garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound <b>of</b> many footsteps, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked round, eager <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like <b>the</b> three gardeners, oblong <b>and</b> flat, with their hands <b>and</b> feet at <b>the</b> corners: next <b>the</b> ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, <b>and</b> walked two <b>and</b> two, as <b>the</b> soldiers did. After these came <b>the</b> royal children; there were ten <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came <b>the</b> guests, mostly Kings <b>and</b> Queens, <b>and</b> among them <b>Alice</b> recognised <b>the</b> White Rabbit: <b>it</b> was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, <b>and</b> went <b>by</b> without noticing her. Then followed <b>the</b> Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, carrying <b>the</b> King's crown <b>on</b> a crimson velvet cushion; <b>and</b>, last <b>of</b> all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
<br><b>Alice</b> was rather doubtful whether she ought not <b>to</b> lie down <b>on</b> her face like <b>the</b> three gardeners, <b>but</b> she could not remember every having heard <b>of</b> such a rule at processions; “<b>and</b> besides, what would be <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a procession,” thought she, “if people had all <b>to</b> lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see <b>it</b>?” So she stood still where she was, <b>and</b> waited.
<br>When <b>the</b> procession came opposite <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, they all stopped <b>and</b> looked at her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, who only bowed <b>and</b> smiled in reply.
<br>“Idiot!” said <b>the</b> Queen, tossing her head impatiently; <b>and</b>, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, she went <b>on</b>, “What's your name, child?”
<br>“My name is <b>Alice</b>, so please your Majesty,” said <b>Alice</b> very politely; <b>but</b> she added, <b>to</b> herself, “Why, they're only a pack <b>of</b> cards, after all. I needn't be afraid <b>of</b> them!”
<br>“And who are THESE?” said <b>the</b> Queen, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners who were lying round <b>the</b> rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying <b>on</b> their faces, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pattern <b>on</b> their backs was <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, <b>or</b> soldiers, <b>or</b> courtiers, <b>or</b> three <b>of</b> her own children.
<br>“How should I know?” said <b>Alice</b>, surprised at her own courage. “It's <b>no</b> business <b>of</b> MINE.”
<br>The Queen turned crimson with fury, <b>and</b>, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”
<br>“Nonsense!” said <b>Alice</b>, very loudly <b>and</b> decidedly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen was silent.
<br>The King laid his hand upon her arm, <b>and</b> timidly said “Consider, my dear: she is only a child!”
<br>The Queen turned angrily away from him, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave “Turn them over!”
<br>The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.
<br>“Get up!” said <b>the</b> Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners instantly jumped up, <b>and</b> began bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King, <b>the</b> Queen, <b>the</b> royal children, <b>and</b> everybody else.
<br>“Leave off that!” screamed <b>the</b> Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rose-tree, she went <b>on</b>, “What HAVE you been doing here?”
<br>“May <b>it</b> please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going down <b>on</b> one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
<br>“I see!” said <b>the</b> Queen, who had meanwhile been examining <b>the</b> roses. “Off with their heads!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> procession moved <b>on</b>, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers remaining behind <b>to</b> execute <b>the</b> unfortunate gardeners, who ran <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> for protection.
<br>“You shan't be beheaded!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> she put them <b>into</b> a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute <b>or</b> two, looking for them, <b>and</b> then quietly marched off after <b>the</b> others.
<br>“Are their heads off?” shouted <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Their heads are gone, if <b>it</b> please your Majesty!” <b>the</b> soldiers shouted in reply.
<br>“That's right!” shouted <b>the</b> Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
<br>The soldiers were silent, <b>and</b> looked at <b>Alice</b>, as <b>the</b> question was evidently meant for her.
<br>“Yes!” shouted <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>, then!” roared <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> joined <b>the</b> procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
<br>“It's—<b>it</b>'s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was walking <b>by</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously <b>into</b> her face.
<br>“Very,” said <b>Alice</b>: “—where's <b>the</b> Duchess?”
<br>“Hush! Hush!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, <b>and</b> then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close <b>to</b> her ear, <b>and</b> whispered “She's under sentence <b>of</b> execution.”
<br>“What for?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Did you say «What a pity!»?” <b>the</b> Rabbit asked.
<br>“No, I didn't,” said <b>Alice</b>: “I don't think <b>it</b>'s at all a pity. I said «What for?"“
<br>“She boxed <b>the</b> Queen's ears—” <b>the</b> Rabbit began. <b>Alice</b> gave a little scream <b>of</b> laughter. “Oh, hush!” <b>the</b> Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen said—”
<br>“Get <b>to</b> your places!” shouted <b>the</b> Queen in a voice <b>of</b> thunder, <b>and</b> people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game began. <b>Alice</b> thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; <b>it</b> was all ridges <b>and</b> furrows; <b>the</b> balls were live hedgehogs, <b>the</b> mallets live flamingoes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> soldiers had <b>to</b> double themselves up <b>and</b> <b>to</b> stand <b>on</b> their hands <b>and</b> feet, <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> arches.
<br>The chief difficulty <b>Alice</b> found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, <b>but</b> generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, <b>and</b> was going <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> hedgehog a blow with its head, <b>it</b> WOULD twist itself round <b>and</b> look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: <b>and</b> when she had got its head down, <b>and</b> was going <b>to</b> begin again, <b>it</b> was very provoking <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> hedgehog had unrolled itself, <b>and</b> was in <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge <b>or</b> furrow in <b>the</b> way wherever she wanted <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> hedgehog <b>to</b>, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> doubled-up soldiers were always getting up <b>and</b> walking off <b>to</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>Alice</b> soon came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that <b>it</b> was a very difficult game indeed.
<br>The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all <b>the</b> while, <b>and</b> fighting for <b>the</b> hedgehogs; <b>and</b> in a very short time <b>the</b> Queen was in a furious passion, <b>and</b> went stamping about, <b>and</b> shouting “Off with his head!” <b>or</b> “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.
<br><b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> feel very uneasy: <b>to</b> be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with <b>the</b> Queen, <b>but</b> she knew that <b>it</b> might happen any minute, “<b>and</b> then,” thought she, “what would become <b>of</b> me? They're dreadfully fond <b>of</b> beheading people here; <b>the</b> great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!”
<br>She was looking about for some way <b>of</b> escape, <b>and</b> wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in <b>the</b> air: <b>it</b> puzzled her very much at first, <b>but</b>, after watching <b>it</b> a minute <b>or</b> two, she made <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> be a grin, <b>and</b> she said <b>to</b> herself “It's <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b>.”
<br>“How are you getting <b>on</b>?” said <b>the</b> Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> speak with.
<br><b>Alice</b> waited till <b>the</b> eyes appeared, <b>and</b> then nodded. “It's <b>no</b> use speaking <b>to</b> <b>it</b>,” she thought, “till its ears have come, <b>or</b> at least one <b>of</b> them.” In another minute <b>the</b> whole head appeared, <b>and</b> then <b>Alice</b> put down her flamingo, <b>and</b> began an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, feeling very glad she had someone <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> her. The Cat seemed <b>to</b> think that there was enough <b>of</b> <b>it</b> now in sight, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> appeared.
<br>“I don't think they play at all fairly,” <b>Alice</b> began, in rather a complaining tone,” <b>and</b> they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak—<b>and</b> they don't seem <b>to</b> have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends <b>to</b> them—<b>and</b> you've <b>no</b> idea how confusing <b>it</b> is all <b>the</b> things being alive; for instance, there's <b>the</b> arch I've got <b>to</b> go through next walking about at <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground—<b>and</b> I should have croqueted <b>the</b> Queen's hedgehog just now, only <b>it</b> ran away when <b>it</b> saw mine coming?”
<br>“How do you like <b>the</b> Queen?” said <b>the</b> Cat in a low voice.
<br>“Not at all,” said <b>Alice</b>: “she's so extremely—” Just then she noticed that <b>the</b> Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went <b>on</b>, “—likely <b>to</b> win, that <b>it</b>'s hardly worth while finishing <b>the</b> game.”
<br>The Queen smiled <b>and</b> passed <b>on</b>.
<br>“Who ARE you talking <b>to</b>?” said <b>the</b> King, going up <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> looking at <b>the</b> Cat's head with great curiosity.
<br>“It's a friend <b>of</b> mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said <b>Alice</b>: “allow me <b>to</b> introduce <b>it</b>.”
<br>“I don't like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at all,” said <b>the</b> King: “however, <b>it</b> may kiss my hand if <b>it</b> likes.”
<br>“I'd rather not,” <b>the</b> Cat remarked.
<br>“Don't be impertinent,” said <b>the</b> King, “<b>and</b> don't look at me like that!” He got behind <b>Alice</b> as he spoke.
<br>“A cat may look at a king,” said <b>Alice</b>. “I've read that in some book, <b>but</b> I don't remember where.”
<br>“Well, <b>it</b> must be removed,” said <b>the</b> King very decidedly, <b>and</b> he called <b>the</b> Queen, who was passing at <b>the</b> moment, “My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!”
<br>The Queen had only one way <b>of</b> settling all difficulties, great <b>or</b> small. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.
<br>“I'll fetch <b>the</b> executioner myself,” said <b>the</b> King eagerly, <b>and</b> he hurried off.
<br><b>Alice</b> thought she might as well go back, <b>and</b> see how <b>the</b> game was going <b>on</b>, as she heard <b>the</b> Queen's voice in <b>the</b> distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players <b>to</b> be executed for having missed their turns, <b>and</b> she did not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> things at all, as <b>the</b> game was in such confusion that she never knew whether <b>it</b> was her turn <b>or</b> not. So she went in search <b>of</b> her hedgehog.
<br>The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> an excellent opportunity for croqueting one <b>of</b> them with <b>the</b> other: <b>the</b> only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden, where <b>Alice</b> could see <b>it</b> trying in a helpless sort <b>of</b> way <b>to</b> fly up <b>into</b> a tree.
<br>By <b>the</b> time she had caught <b>the</b> flamingo <b>and</b> brought <b>it</b> back, <b>the</b> fight was over, <b>and</b> both <b>the</b> hedgehogs were out <b>of</b> sight: “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter much,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “as all <b>the</b> arches are gone from <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground.” So she tucked <b>it</b> away under her arm, that <b>it</b> might not escape again, <b>and</b> went back for a little more conversation with her friend.
<br>When she got back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat, she was surprised <b>to</b> find quite a large crowd collected round <b>it</b>: there was a dispute going <b>on</b> between <b>the</b> executioner, <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen, who were all talking at once, while all <b>the</b> rest were quite silent, <b>and</b> looked very uncomfortable.
<br>The moment <b>Alice</b> appeared, she was appealed <b>to</b> <b>by</b> all three <b>to</b> settle <b>the</b> question, <b>and</b> they repeated their arguments <b>to</b> her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found <b>it</b> very hard indeed <b>to</b> make out exactly what they said.
<br>The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body <b>to</b> cut <b>it</b> off from: that he had never had <b>to</b> do such a thing before, <b>and</b> he wasn't going <b>to</b> begin at HIS time <b>of</b> life.
<br>The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, <b>and</b> that you weren't <b>to</b> talk nonsense.
<br>The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about <b>it</b> in less than <b>no</b> time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made <b>the</b> whole party look so grave <b>and</b> anxious.)
<br><b>Alice</b> could think <b>of</b> nothing else <b>to</b> say <b>but</b> “It belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duchess: you'd better ask HER about <b>it</b>.”
<br>“She's in prison,” <b>the</b> Queen said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> executioner: “fetch her here.” And <b>the</b> executioner went off like an arrow.
<br>The Cat's head began fading away <b>the</b> moment he was gone, <b>and</b>, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time he had disappeared; so <b>the</b> King <b>and</b> <b>the</b> executioner ran wildly up <b>and</b> down looking for <b>it</b>, while <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game.

<br>Chapter IX
<br>THE MOCK TURTLE'S STORY
<br>
<br>“You can't think you glad I am <b>to</b> see you again, you dear old thing!” said <b>the</b> Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s, <b>and</b> they walked off together.
<br><b>Alice</b> was very glad <b>to</b> find her in such a pleasant temper, <b>and</b> thought <b>to</b> herself that perhaps <b>it</b> was only <b>the</b> pepper that had made her so savage when they met in <b>the</b> kitchen.
<br>“When I'M a Duchess,” she said <b>to</b> herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), “I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very well without—Maybe <b>it</b>'s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went <b>on</b>, very much pleased at having found out a new kind <b>of</b> rule, “<b>and</b> vinegar that makes them sour—<b>and</b> camomile that makes them bitter—<b>and</b>—<b>and</b> barley-sugar <b>and</b> such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about <b>it</b>, you know—”
<br>She had quite forgotten <b>the</b> Duchess <b>by</b> this time, <b>and</b> was a little startled when she heard her voice close <b>to</b> her ear. “You're thinking about something, my dear, <b>and</b> that makes you forget <b>to</b> talk. I can't tell you just now what <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that is, <b>but</b> I shall remember <b>it</b> in a bit.”
<br>“Perhaps <b>it</b> hasn't one,” <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> remark.
<br>“Tut, tut, child!” said <b>the</b> Duchess. “Everything's got a moral, if only you can find <b>it</b>.” And she squeezed herself up closer <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>'s side as she spoke.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not much like keeping so close <b>to</b> her: first, because <b>the</b> Duchess was VERY ugly; <b>and</b> secondly, because she was exactly <b>the</b> right height <b>to</b> rest her chin upon <b>Alice</b>'s shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like <b>to</b> be rude, so she bore <b>it</b> as well as she could.
<br>“The game's going <b>on</b> rather better now,” she said, <b>by</b> way <b>of</b> keeping up <b>the</b> conversation a little.
<br>“'Tis so,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that is—"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes <b>the</b> world go round!"“
<br>“Somebody said,” <b>Alice</b> whispered, “that <b>it</b>'s done <b>by</b> everybody minding their own business!”
<br>“Ah, well! It means much <b>the</b> same thing,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, digging her sharp little chin <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s shoulder as she added, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> THAT is—"Take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sense, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sounds will take care <b>of</b> themselves."“
<br>“How fond she is <b>of</b> finding morals in things!” <b>Alice</b> thought <b>to</b> herself.
<br>“I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,” <b>the</b> Duchess said after a pause: “<b>the</b> reason is, that I'm doubtful about <b>the</b> temper <b>of</b> your flamingo. Shall I try <b>the</b> experiment?”
<br>“HE might bite,” <b>Alice</b> cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> experiment tried.
<br>“Very true,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “flamingoes <b>and</b> mustard both bite. And <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that is—"Birds <b>of</b> a feather flock together."“
<br>“Only mustard isn't a bird,” <b>Alice</b> remarked.
<br>“Right, as usual,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “what a clear way you have <b>of</b> putting things!”
<br>“It's a mineral, I THINK,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Of course <b>it</b> is,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, who seemed ready <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> everything that <b>Alice</b> said; “there's a large mustard-mine near here. And <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that is—"The more there is <b>of</b> mine, <b>the</b> less there is <b>of</b> yours."“
<br>“Oh, I know!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>, who had not attended <b>to</b> this last remark, “<b>it</b>'s a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> is.”
<br>“I quite agree with you,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that is—"Be what you would seem <b>to</b> be"—<b>or</b> if you'd like <b>it</b> put more simply—"Never imagine yourself not <b>to</b> be otherwise than what <b>it</b> might appear <b>to</b> others that what you were <b>or</b> might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> be otherwise."“
<br>“I think I should understand that better,” <b>Alice</b> said very politely, “if I had <b>it</b> written down: <b>but</b> I can't quite follow <b>it</b> as you say <b>it</b>.”
<br>“That's nothing <b>to</b> what I could say if I chose,” <b>the</b> Duchess replied, in a pleased tone.
<br>“Pray don't trouble yourself <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> any longer than that,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Oh, don't talk about trouble!” said <b>the</b> Duchess. “I make you a present <b>of</b> everything I've said as yet.”
<br>“A cheap sort <b>of</b> present!” thought <b>Alice</b>. “I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!” But she did not venture <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> out loud.
<br>“Thinking again?” <b>the</b> Duchess asked, with another dig <b>of</b> her sharp little chin.
<br>“I've a right <b>to</b> think” said <b>Alice</b> sharply, for she was beginning <b>to</b> feel a little worried.
<br>“Just about as much right,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “as pigs have <b>to</b> fly; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> m—”
<br>But here, <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>'s great surprise, <b>the</b> Duchess's voice died away, even in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> her favourite word “moral,” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arm that was linked <b>into</b> hers began <b>to</b> tremble. <b>Alice</b> looked up, <b>and</b> there stood <b>the</b> Queen in front <b>of</b> them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
<br>“A fine day, your Majesty!” <b>the</b> Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
<br>“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted <b>the</b> Queen, stamping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground as she spoke; “either you <b>or</b> your head must be off, <b>and</b> that in about half <b>no</b> time! Take your choice!”
<br>The Duchess took her choice, <b>and</b> was gone in a moment.
<br>“Let's go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> game,” <b>the</b> Queen said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>; <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> was too much frightened <b>to</b> say a word, <b>but</b> slowly followed her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> croquet-ground.
<br>The other guests had taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's absence, <b>and</b> were resting in <b>the</b> shade: however, <b>the</b> moment they saw her, they hurried back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.
<br>All <b>the</b> time they were playing <b>the</b> Queen never left off quarrelling with <b>the</b> other players, <b>and</b> shouting “Off with his head!” <b>or</b> “Off with her head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken <b>into</b> custody <b>by</b> <b>the</b> soldiers, who <b>of</b> course had <b>to</b> leave off being arches <b>to</b> do this, so that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> half an hour <b>or</b> so there were <b>no</b> arches left, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> players, except <b>the</b> King, <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>, were in custody <b>and</b> under sentence <b>of</b> execution.
<br>Then <b>the</b> Queen left off, quite out <b>of</b> breath, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, “Have you seen <b>the</b> Mock Turtle yet?”
<br>“No,” said <b>Alice</b>. “I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“I never saw one, <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> one,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>, then,” said <b>the</b> Queen, “<b>and</b> he shall tell you his history,”
<br>As they walked off together, <b>Alice</b> heard <b>the</b> King say in a low voice, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, THAT'S a good thing!” she said <b>to</b> herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> executions <b>the</b> Queen had ordered.
<br>They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in <b>the</b> sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at <b>the</b> picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said <b>the</b> Queen, “<b>and</b> take this young lady <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> hear his history. I must go back <b>and</b> see after some executions I have ordered'; <b>and</b> she walked off, leaving <b>Alice</b> alone with <b>the</b> Gryphon. <b>Alice</b> did not quite like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creature, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole she thought <b>it</b> would be quite as safe <b>to</b> stay with <b>it</b> as <b>to</b> go after that savage Queen: so she waited.
<br>The Gryphon sat up <b>and</b> rubbed its eyes: then <b>it</b> watched <b>the</b> Queen till she was out <b>of</b> sight: then <b>it</b> chuckled. “What fun!” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, half <b>to</b> itself, half <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“What IS <b>the</b> fun?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why, SHE,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “It's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>“Everybody says «come <b>on</b>!» here,” thought <b>Alice</b>, as she went slowly after <b>it</b>: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”
<br>They had not gone far before they saw <b>the</b> Mock Turtle in <b>the</b> distance, sitting sad <b>and</b> lonely <b>on</b> a little ledge <b>of</b> rock, <b>and</b>, as they came nearer, <b>Alice</b> could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon answered, very nearly in <b>the</b> same words as before, “It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got <b>no</b> sorrow, you know. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>So they went up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full <b>of</b> tears, <b>but</b> said nothing.
<br>“This here young lady,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “she wants for <b>to</b> know your history, she do.”
<br>“I'll tell <b>it</b> her,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> don't speak a word till I've finished.”
<br>So they sat down, <b>and</b> nobody spoke for some minutes. <b>Alice</b> thought <b>to</b> herself, “I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.” But she waited patiently.
<br>“Once,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”
<br>These words were followed <b>by</b> a very long silence, broken only <b>by</b> an occasional exclamation <b>of</b> “Hjckrrh!” from <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> constant heavy sobbing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle. <b>Alice</b> was very nearly getting up <b>and</b> saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” <b>but</b> she could not help thinking there MUST be more <b>to</b> come, so she sat still <b>and</b> said nothing.
<br>“When we were little,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle went <b>on</b> at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now <b>and</b> then, “we went <b>to</b> school in <b>the</b> sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used <b>to</b> call him Tortoise—”
<br>“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?” <b>Alice</b> asked.
<br>“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are very dull!”
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> be ashamed <b>of</b> yourself for asking such a simple question,” added <b>the</b> Gryphon; <b>and</b> then they both sat silent <b>and</b> looked at poor <b>Alice</b>, who felt ready <b>to</b> sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> earth. At last <b>the</b> Gryphon said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “Drive <b>on</b>, old fellow! Don't be all day about <b>it</b>!” <b>and</b> he went <b>on</b> in these words:
<br>“Yes, we went <b>to</b> school in <b>the</b> sea, though you mayn't believe <b>it</b>—”
<br>“I never said I didn't!” interrupted <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You did,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Hold your tongue!” added <b>the</b> Gryphon, before <b>Alice</b> could speak again. The Mock Turtle went <b>on</b>.
<br>“We had <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> educations—in fact, we went <b>to</b> school every day—”
<br>“I'VE been <b>to</b> a day-school, too,” said <b>Alice</b>; “you needn't be so proud as all that.”
<br>“With extras?” asked <b>the</b> Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b>, “we learned French <b>and</b> music.”
<br>“And washing?” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Certainly not!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly.
<br>“Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle in a tone <b>of</b> great relief. “Now at OURS they had at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill, «French, music, AND WASHING—extra."“
<br>“You couldn't have wanted <b>it</b> much,” said <b>Alice</b>; “living at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.”
<br>“I couldn't afford <b>to</b> learn <b>it</b>.” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I only took <b>the</b> regular course.”
<br>“What was that?” inquired <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Reeling <b>and</b> Writhing, <b>of</b> course, <b>to</b> begin with,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied; “<b>and</b> then <b>the</b> different branches <b>of</b> Arithmetic— Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, <b>and</b> Derision.”
<br>“I never heard <b>of</b> «Uglification,» <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> say. “What is <b>it</b>?”
<br>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard <b>of</b> uglifying!” <b>it</b> exclaimed. “You know what <b>to</b> beautify is, I suppose?”
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b> doubtfully: “<b>it</b> means—<b>to</b>—make—anything— prettier.”
<br>“Well, then,” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b>, “if you don't know what <b>to</b> uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.”
<br><b>Alice</b> did not feel encouraged <b>to</b> ask any more questions about <b>it</b>, so she turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, <b>and</b> said “What else had you <b>to</b> learn?”
<br>“Well, there was Mystery,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied, counting off <b>the</b> subjects <b>on</b> his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient <b>and</b> modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—<b>the</b> Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used <b>to</b> come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, <b>and</b> Fainting in Coils.”
<br>“What was THAT like?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Well, I can't show <b>it</b> you myself,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “I'm too stiff. And <b>the</b> Gryphon never learnt <b>it</b>.”
<br>“Hadn't time,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: “I went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Classics master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.”
<br>“I never went <b>to</b> him,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing <b>and</b> Grief, they used <b>to</b> say.”
<br>“So he did, so he did,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, sighing in his turn; <b>and</b> both creatures hid their faces in their paws.
<br>“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said <b>Alice</b>, in a hurry <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject.
<br>“Ten hours <b>the</b> first day,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “nine <b>the</b> next, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>.”
<br>“What a curious plan!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“That's <b>the</b> reason they're called lessons,” <b>the</b> Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day <b>to</b> day.”
<br>This was quite a new idea <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> she thought <b>it</b> over a little before she made her next remark. “Then <b>the</b> eleventh day must have been a holiday?”
<br>“Of course <b>it</b> was,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“And how did you manage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> twelfth?” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b> eagerly.
<br>“That's enough about lessons,” <b>the</b> Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: “tell her something about <b>the</b> games now.”
<br>

<br>Chapter X
<br>THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE
<br>
<br>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> one flapper across his eyes. He looked at <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> speak, <b>but</b> for a minute <b>or</b> two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: <b>and</b> <b>it</b> set <b>to</b> work shaking him <b>and</b> punching him in <b>the</b> back. At last <b>the</b> Mock Turtle recovered his voice, <b>and</b>, with tears running down his cheeks, he went <b>on</b> again:—
<br>“You may not have lived much under <b>the</b> sea—” (I haven't,” said <b>Alice</b>)—`<b>and</b> perhaps you were never even introduced <b>to</b> a lobster- -” (<b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> say “I once tasted—” <b>but</b> checked herself hastily, <b>and</b> said “No, never') “—so you can have <b>no</b> idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!”
<br>“No, indeed,” said <b>Alice</b>. “What sort <b>of</b> a dance is <b>it</b>?”
<br>“Why,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “you first form <b>into</b> a line along <b>the</b> sea-shore—”
<br>“Two lines!” cried <b>the</b> Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>; then, when you've cleared all <b>the</b> jelly-fish out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way—”
<br>“THAT generally takes some time,” interrupted <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“—you advance twice—”
<br>“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Of course,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set <b>to</b> partners—”
<br>“—change lobsters, <b>and</b> retire in same order,” continued <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Then, you know,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle went <b>on</b>, “you throw <b>the</b>—”
<br>“The lobsters!” shouted <b>the</b> Gryphon, with a bound <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air.
<br>“—as far out <b>to</b> sea as you can—”
<br>“Swim after them!” screamed <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Back <b>to</b> land again, <b>and</b> that's all <b>the</b> first figure,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly <b>and</b> quietly, <b>and</b> looked at <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“It must be a very pretty dance,” said <b>Alice</b> timidly.
<br>“Would you like <b>to</b> see a little <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Very much indeed,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come, let's try <b>the</b> first figure!” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
<br>“Oh, YOU sing,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “I've forgotten <b>the</b> words.”
<br>So they began solemnly dancing round <b>and</b> round <b>Alice</b>, every now <b>and</b> then treading <b>on</b> her toes when they passed too close, <b>and</b> waving their forepaws <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> time, while <b>the</b> Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly <b>and</b> sadly:—
<br>“"Will you walk a little faster?» said a whiting <b>to</b> a snail. «There's a porpoise close behind us, <b>and</b> he's treading <b>on</b> my tail. See how eagerly <b>the</b> lobsters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> turtles all advance! They are waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shingle—will you come <b>and</b> join <b>the</b> dance?
<br>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join <b>the</b> dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join <b>the</b> dance?
<br>«You can really have <b>no</b> notion how delightful <b>it</b> will be When they take us up <b>and</b> throw us, with <b>the</b> lobsters, out <b>to</b>
<br>sea!» But <b>the</b> snail replied «Too far, too far!» <b>and</b> gave a look
<br>askance— Said he thanked <b>the</b> whiting kindly, <b>but</b> he would not join <b>the</b> dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
<br><b>the</b> dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
<br><b>the</b> dance.
<br>“"What matters <b>it</b> how far we go?» his scaly friend replied. «There is another shore, you know, upon <b>the</b> other side. The further off from England <b>the</b> nearer is <b>to</b> France— Then turn not pale, beloved snail, <b>but</b> come <b>and</b> join <b>the</b> dance.
<br>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join <b>the</b>
<br>dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join <b>the</b>
<br>dance?"“
<br>“Thank you, <b>it</b>'s a very interesting dance <b>to</b> watch,” said <b>Alice</b>, feeling very glad that <b>it</b> was over at last: “<b>and</b> I do so like that curious song about <b>the</b> whiting!”
<br>“Oh, as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whiting,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “they—you've seen them, <b>of</b> course?”
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b>, “I've often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself hastily.
<br>“I don't know where Dinn may be,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “<b>but</b> if you've seen them so often, <b>of</b> course you know what they're like.”
<br>“I believe so,” <b>Alice</b> replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in their mouths—<b>and</b> they're all over crumbs.”
<br>“You're wrong about <b>the</b> crumbs,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash off in <b>the</b> sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reason is—” here <b>the</b> Mock Turtle yawned <b>and</b> shut his eyes.—`Tell her about <b>the</b> reason <b>and</b> all that,” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“The reason is,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “that they WOULD go with <b>the</b> lobsters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dance. So they got thrown out <b>to</b> sea. So they had <b>to</b> fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.”
<br>“Thank you,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b>'s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.”
<br>“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “Do you know why <b>it</b>'s called a whiting?”
<br>“I never thought about <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>. “Why?”
<br>“IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.” <b>the</b> Gryphon replied very solemnly.
<br><b>Alice</b> was thoroughly puzzled. “Does <b>the</b> boots <b>and</b> shoes!” she repeated in a wondering tone.
<br>“Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “I mean, what makes them so shiny?”
<br><b>Alice</b> looked down at them, <b>and</b> considered a little before she gave her answer. “They're done with blacking, I believe.”
<br>“Boots <b>and</b> shoes under <b>the</b> sea,” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b> in a deep voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”
<br>“And what are they made <b>of</b>?” <b>Alice</b> asked in a tone <b>of</b> great curiosity.
<br>“Soles <b>and</b> eels, <b>of</b> course,” <b>the</b> Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”
<br>“If I'd been <b>the</b> whiting,” said <b>Alice</b>, whose thoughts were still running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> song, “I'd have said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porpoise, «Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"“
<br>“They were obliged <b>to</b> have him with them,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “<b>no</b> wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”
<br>“Wouldn't <b>it</b> really?” said <b>Alice</b> in a tone <b>of</b> great surprise.
<br>“Of course not,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came <b>to</b> ME, <b>and</b> told me he was going a journey, I should say «With what porpoise?"“
<br>“Don't you mean «purpose»?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“I mean what I say,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And <b>the</b> Gryphon added “Come, let's hear some <b>of</b> YOUR adventures.”
<br>“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said <b>Alice</b> a little timidly: “<b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> use going back <b>to</b> yesterday, because I was a different person then.”
<br>“Explain all that,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“No, <b>no</b>! The adventures first,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon in an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”
<br>So <b>Alice</b> began telling them her adventures from <b>the</b> time when she first saw <b>the</b> White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about <b>it</b> just at first, <b>the</b> two creatures got so close <b>to</b> her, one <b>on</b> each side, <b>and</b> opened their eyes <b>and</b> mouths so VERY wide, <b>but</b> she gained courage as she went <b>on</b>. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> part about her repeating “YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,” <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caterpillar, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words all coming different, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Mock Turtle drew a long breath, <b>and</b> said “That's very curious.”
<br>“It's all about as curious as <b>it</b> can be,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“It all came different!” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I should like <b>to</b> hear her try <b>and</b> repeat something now. Tell her <b>to</b> begin.” He looked at <b>the</b> Gryphon as if he thought <b>it</b> had some kind <b>of</b> authority over <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Stand up <b>and</b> repeat «'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"“ said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“How <b>the</b> creatures order one about, <b>and</b> make one repeat lessons!” thought <b>Alice</b>; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got up, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> her head was so full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words came very queer indeed:—
<br>«'Tis <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster; I heard him declare, «You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.» As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt <b>and</b> his buttons, <b>and</b> turns out his toes.”
<br>[later editions continued as follows When <b>the</b> sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shark, But, when <b>the</b> tide rises <b>and</b> sharks are around, His voice has a timid <b>and</b> tremulous sound.]
<br>“That's different from what I used <b>to</b> say when I was a child,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Well, I never heard <b>it</b> before,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> sounds uncommon nonsense.”
<br><b>Alice</b> said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again.
<br>“I should like <b>to</b> have <b>it</b> explained,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“She can't explain <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon hastily. “Go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> next verse.”
<br>“But about his toes?” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle persisted. “How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> first position in dancing.” <b>Alice</b> said; <b>but</b> was dreadfully puzzled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, <b>and</b> longed <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject.
<br>“Go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> next verse,” <b>the</b> Gryphon repeated impatiently: “<b>it</b> begins «I passed <b>by</b> his garden."“
<br><b>Alice</b> did not dare <b>to</b> disobey, though she felt sure <b>it</b> would all come wrong, <b>and</b> she went <b>on</b> in a trembling voice:—
<br>“I passed <b>by</b> his garden, <b>and</b> marked, with one eye, How <b>the</b> Owl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Panther were sharing a pie—”
<br>[later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, <b>and</b> gravy, <b>and</b> meat, While <b>the</b> Owl had <b>the</b> dish as its share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treat. When <b>the</b> pie was all finished, <b>the</b> Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted <b>to</b> pocket <b>the</b> spoon: While <b>the</b> Panther received knife <b>and</b> fork with a growl, And concluded <b>the</b> banquet—]
<br>“What IS <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> repeating all that stuff,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle interrupted, “if you don't explain <b>it</b> as you go <b>on</b>? It's <b>by</b> far <b>the</b> most confusing thing I ever heard!”
<br>“Yes, I think you'd better leave off,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> was only too glad <b>to</b> do so.
<br>“Shall we try another figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster Quadrille?” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b>. “Or would you like <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>to</b> sing you a song?”
<br>“Oh, a song, please, if <b>the</b> Mock Turtle would be so kind,” <b>Alice</b> replied, so eagerly that <b>the</b> Gryphon said, in a rather offended toe, “Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her «Turtle Soup,» will you, old fellow?”
<br>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, <b>and</b> began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, <b>to</b> sing this:—
<br>
<br>“Beautiful Soup, so rich <b>and</b> green,
<br>Waiting in a hot tureen!
<br>Who for such dainties would not stoop?
<br>Soup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, beautiful Soup!
<br>
<br>Soup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, beautiful Soup!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
<br>
<br>“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
<br>Game, <b>or</b> any other dish?
<br>Who would not give all else for two penny
<br>worth only <b>of</b> beautiful Soup?
<br>Pennyworth only <b>of</b> beautiful Soup?
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
<br>
<br>“Chorus again!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle had just begun <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, when a cry <b>of</b> “The trial's beginning!” was heard in <b>the</b> distance.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b>, taking <b>Alice</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand, <b>it</b> hurried off, without waiting for <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.
<br>“What trial is <b>it</b>?” <b>Alice</b> panted as she ran; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon only answered “Come <b>on</b>!” <b>and</b> ran <b>the</b> faster, while more <b>and</b> more faintly came, carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breeze that followed them, <b>the</b> melancholy words:—
<br>
<br>“Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter XI
<br>WHO STOLE THE TARTS?
<br>
<br>The King <b>and</b> Queen <b>of</b> Hearts were seated <b>on</b> their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts <b>of</b> little birds <b>and</b> beasts, as well as <b>the</b> whole pack <b>of</b> cards: <b>the</b> Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier <b>on</b> each side <b>to</b> guard him; <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> King was <b>the</b> White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, <b>and</b> a scroll <b>of</b> parchment in <b>the</b> other. In <b>the</b> very middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court was a table, with a large dish <b>of</b> tarts upon <b>it</b>: they looked so good, that <b>it</b> made <b>Alice</b> quite hungry <b>to</b> look at them—`I wish they'd get <b>the</b> trial done,” she thought, “<b>and</b> hand round <b>the</b> refreshments!” But there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> this, so she began looking at everything about her, <b>to</b> pass away <b>the</b> time.
<br><b>Alice</b> had never been in a court <b>of</b> justice before, <b>but</b> she had read about them in books, <b>and</b> she was quite pleased <b>to</b> find that she knew <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> nearly everything there. “That's <b>the</b> judge,” she said <b>to</b> herself, “because <b>of</b> his great wig.”
<br>The judge, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way, was <b>the</b> King; <b>and</b> as he wore his crown over <b>the</b> wig, (look at <b>the</b> frontispiece if you want <b>to</b> see how he did <b>it</b>,) he did not look at all comfortable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> was certainly not becoming.
<br>“And that's <b>the</b> jury-box,” thought <b>Alice</b>, “<b>and</b> those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged <b>to</b> say “creatures,” you see, because some <b>of</b> them were animals, <b>and</b> some were birds,) “I suppose they are <b>the</b> jurors.” She said this last word two <b>or</b> three times over <b>to</b> herself, being rather proud <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: for she thought, <b>and</b> rightly too, that very few little girls <b>of</b> her age knew <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.
<br>The twelve jurors were all writing very busily <b>on</b> slates. “What are they doing?” <b>Alice</b> whispered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon. “They can't have anything <b>to</b> put down yet, before <b>the</b> trial's begun.”
<br>“They're putting down their names,” <b>the</b> Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial.”
<br>“Stupid things!” <b>Alice</b> began in a loud, indignant voice, <b>but</b> she stopped hastily, for <b>the</b> White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in <b>the</b> court!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King put <b>on</b> his spectacles <b>and</b> looked anxiously round, <b>to</b> make out who was talking.
<br><b>Alice</b> could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all <b>the</b> jurors were writing down “stupid things!” <b>on</b> their slates, <b>and</b> she could even make out that one <b>of</b> them didn't know how <b>to</b> spell “stupid,” <b>and</b> that he had <b>to</b> ask his neighbour <b>to</b> tell him. “A nice muddle their slates'll be in before <b>the</b> trial's over!” thought <b>Alice</b>.
<br>One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This <b>of</b> course, <b>Alice</b> could not stand, <b>and</b> she went round <b>the</b> court <b>and</b> got behind him, <b>and</b> very soon found an opportunity <b>of</b> taking <b>it</b> away. She did <b>it</b> so quickly that <b>the</b> poor little juror (<b>it</b> was Bill, <b>the</b> Lizard) could not make out at all what had become <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; so, after hunting all about for <b>it</b>, he was obliged <b>to</b> write with one finger for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day; <b>and</b> this was <b>of</b> very little use, as <b>it</b> left <b>no</b> mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slate.
<br>“Herald, read <b>the</b> accusation!” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>On this <b>the</b> White Rabbit blew three blasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trumpet, <b>and</b> then unrolled <b>the</b> parchment scroll, <b>and</b> read as follows:—
<br>“The Queen <b>of</b> Hearts, she made some tarts,
<br>All <b>on</b> a summer day:
<br>The Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, he stole those tarts,
<br>And took them quite away!”
<br>“Consider your verdict,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury.
<br>“Not yet, not yet!” <b>the</b> Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There's a great deal <b>to</b> come before that!”
<br>“Call <b>the</b> first witness,” said <b>the</b> King; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit blew three blasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trumpet, <b>and</b> called out, “First witness!”
<br>The first witness was <b>the</b> Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand <b>and</b> a piece <b>of</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter in <b>the</b> other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: <b>but</b> I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.”
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> have finished,” said <b>the</b> King. “When did you begin?”
<br>The Hatter looked at <b>the</b> March Hare, who had followed him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> court, arm-in-arm with <b>the</b> Dormouse. “Fourteenth <b>of</b> March, I think <b>it</b> was,” he said.
<br>“Fifteenth,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Sixteenth,” added <b>the</b> Dormouse.
<br>“Write that down,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> jury eagerly wrote down all three dates <b>on</b> their slates, <b>and</b> then added them up, <b>and</b> reduced <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> shillings <b>and</b> pence.
<br>“Take off your hat,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“It isn't mine,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“Stolen!” <b>the</b> King exclaimed, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, who instantly made a memorandum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact.
<br>“I keep them <b>to</b> sell,” <b>the</b> Hatter added as an explanation; “I've none <b>of</b> my own. I'm a hatter.”
<br>Here <b>the</b> Queen put <b>on</b> her spectacles, <b>and</b> began staring at <b>the</b> Hatter, who turned pale <b>and</b> fidgeted.
<br>“Give your evidence,” said <b>the</b> King; “<b>and</b> don't be nervous, <b>or</b> I'll have you executed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.”
<br>This did not seem <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> witness at all: he kept shifting form one foot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, looking uneasily at <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> in his confusion he bit a large piece out <b>of</b> his teacup instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter.
<br>Just at this moment <b>Alice</b> felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what <b>it</b> was: she was beginning <b>to</b> grow larger again, <b>and</b> she thought at first she would get up <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> court; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> second thoughts she decided <b>to</b> remain where she was as long as there was room for her.
<br>“I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, who was sitting next <b>to</b> her. “I can hardly breathe.”
<br>“I can't help <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b> very meekly: “I'm growing.”
<br>“You've <b>no</b> right <b>to</b> grow here,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse.
<br>“Don't talk nonsense,” said <b>Alice</b> more boldly: “you know you're growing too.”
<br>“Yes, <b>but</b> I grow at a reasonable pace,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily <b>and</b> crossed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court.
<br>All this time <b>the</b> Queen had never left off staring at <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b>, just as <b>the</b> Dormouse crossed <b>the</b> court, she said <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, “Bring me <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singers in <b>the</b> last concert!” <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
<br>“Give your evidence,” <b>the</b> King repeated angrily, “<b>or</b> I'll have you executed, whether you're nervous <b>or</b> not.”
<br>“I'm a poor man, your Majesty,” <b>the</b> Hatter began, in a trembling voice, “—<b>and</b> I hadn't begun my tea—not above a week <b>or</b> so—<b>and</b> what with <b>the</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter getting so thin—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> twinkling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea—”
<br>“The twinkling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> what?” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“It began with <b>the</b> tea,” <b>the</b> Hatter replied.
<br>“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said <b>the</b> King sharply. “Do you take me for a dunce? Go <b>on</b>!”
<br>“I'm a poor man,” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b>, “<b>and</b> most things twinkled after that—only <b>the</b> March Hare said—”
<br>“I didn't!” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“I deny <b>it</b>!” said <b>the</b> King: “leave out that part.”
<br>“Well, at any rate, <b>the</b> Dormouse said—” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b>, looking anxiously round <b>to</b> see if he would deny <b>it</b> too: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
<br>“After that,” continued <b>the</b> Hatter, “I cut some more bread- <b>and</b>-butter—”
<br>“But what did <b>the</b> Dormouse say?” one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jury asked.
<br>“That I can't remember,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“You MUST remember,” remarked <b>the</b> King, “<b>or</b> I'll have you executed.”
<br>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup <b>and</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter, <b>and</b> went down <b>on</b> one knee. “I'm a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
<br>“You're a very poor speaker,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>Here one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guinea-pigs cheered, <b>and</b> was immediately suppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain <b>to</b> you how <b>it</b> was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at <b>the</b> mouth with strings: <b>into</b> this they slipped <b>the</b> guinea-pig, head first, <b>and</b> then sat upon <b>it</b>.)
<br>“I'm glad I've seen that done,” thought <b>Alice</b>. “I've so often read in <b>the</b> newspapers, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> trials, «There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court,» <b>and</b> I never understood what <b>it</b> meant till now.”
<br>“If that's all you know about <b>it</b>, you may stand down,” continued <b>the</b> King.
<br>“I can't go <b>no</b> lower,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “I'm <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, as <b>it</b> is.”
<br>“Then you may SIT down,” <b>the</b> King replied.
<br>Here <b>the</b> other guinea-pig cheered, <b>and</b> was suppressed.
<br>“Come, that finished <b>the</b> guinea-pigs!” thought <b>Alice</b>. “Now we shall get <b>on</b> better.”
<br>“I'd rather finish my tea,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, with an anxious look at <b>the</b> Queen, who was reading <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> singers.
<br>“You may go,” said <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hatter hurriedly left <b>the</b> court, without even waiting <b>to</b> put his shoes <b>on</b>.
<br>“—<b>and</b> just take his head off outside,” <b>the</b> Queen added <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hatter was out <b>of</b> sight before <b>the</b> officer could get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.
<br>“Call <b>the</b> next witness!” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>The next witness was <b>the</b> Duchess's cook. She carried <b>the</b> pepper-box in her hand, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> guessed who <b>it</b> was, even before she got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> court, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> people near <b>the</b> door began sneezing all at once.
<br>“Give your evidence,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Shan't,” said <b>the</b> cook.
<br>The King looked anxiously at <b>the</b> White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.”
<br>“Well, if I must, I must,” <b>the</b> King said, with a melancholy air, <b>and</b>, after folding his arms <b>and</b> frowning at <b>the</b> cook till his eyes were nearly out <b>of</b> sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made <b>of</b>?”
<br>“Pepper, mostly,” said <b>the</b> cook.
<br>“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.
<br>“Collar that Dormouse,” <b>the</b> Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out <b>of</b> court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!”
<br>For some minutes <b>the</b> whole court was in confusion, getting <b>the</b> Dormouse turned out, <b>and</b>, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time they had settled down again, <b>the</b> cook had disappeared.
<br>“Never mind!” said <b>the</b> King, with an air <b>of</b> great relief. “Call <b>the</b> next witness.” And he added in an undertone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen, “Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine <b>the</b> next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”
<br><b>Alice</b> watched <b>the</b> White Rabbit as he fumbled over <b>the</b> list, feeling very curious <b>to</b> see what <b>the</b> next witness would be like, “—for they haven't got much evidence YET,” she said <b>to</b> herself. Imagine her surprise, when <b>the</b> White Rabbit read out, at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> his shrill little voice, <b>the</b> name “<b>Alice</b>!”
<br>
<br>
<br>Chapter XII
<br>ALICE'S EVIDENCE
<br>
<br>“Here!” cried <b>Alice</b>, quite forgetting in <b>the</b> flurry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment how large she had grown in <b>the</b> last few minutes, <b>and</b> she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over <b>the</b> jury-box with <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> her skirt, upsetting all <b>the</b> jurymen <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd below, <b>and</b> there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much <b>of</b> a globe <b>of</b> goldfish she had accidentally upset <b>the</b> week before.
<br>“Oh, I BEG your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone <b>of</b> great dismay, <b>and</b> began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for <b>the</b> accident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goldfish kept running in her head, <b>and</b> she had a vague sort <b>of</b> idea that they must be collected at once <b>and</b> put back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jury-box, <b>or</b> they would die.
<br>“The trial cannot proceed,” said <b>the</b> King in a very grave voice, “until all <b>the</b> jurymen are back in their proper places— ALL,” he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at <b>Alice</b> as he said do.
<br><b>Alice</b> looked at <b>the</b> jury-box, <b>and</b> saw that, in her haste, she had put <b>the</b> Lizard in head downwards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable <b>to</b> move. She soon got <b>it</b> out again, <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> right; “not that <b>it</b> signifies much,” she said <b>to</b> herself; “I should think <b>it</b> would be QUITE as much use in <b>the</b> trial one way up as <b>the</b> other.”
<br>As soon as <b>the</b> jury had a little recovered from <b>the</b> shock <b>of</b> being upset, <b>and</b> their slates <b>and</b> pencils had been found <b>and</b> handed back <b>to</b> them, they set <b>to</b> work very diligently <b>to</b> write out a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, all except <b>the</b> Lizard, who seemed too much overcome <b>to</b> do anything <b>but</b> sit with its mouth open, gazing up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court.
<br>“What do you know about this business?” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Nothing,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Nothing WHATEVER?” persisted <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Nothing whatever,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“That's very important,” <b>the</b> King said, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury. They were just beginning <b>to</b> write this down <b>on</b> their slates, when <b>the</b> White Rabbit interrupted: “UNimportant, your Majesty means, <b>of</b> course,” he said in a very respectful tone, <b>but</b> frowning <b>and</b> making faces at him as he spoke.
<br>“UNimportant, <b>of</b> course, I meant,” <b>the</b> King hastily said, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> himself in an undertone, “important—unimportant— unimportant—important—” as if he were trying which word sounded best.
<br>Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jury wrote <b>it</b> down “important,” <b>and</b> some “unimportant.” <b>Alice</b> could see this, as she was near enough <b>to</b> look over their slates; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter a bit,” she thought <b>to</b> herself.
<br>At this moment <b>the</b> King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out “Silence!” <b>and</b> read out from his book, “Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.”
<br>Everybody looked at <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“I'M not a mile high,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You are,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Nearly two miles high,” added <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Well, I shan't go, at any rate,” said <b>Alice</b>: “besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented <b>it</b> just now.”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> oldest rule in <b>the</b> book,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be Number One,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>The King turned pale, <b>and</b> shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your verdict,” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, in a low, trembling voice.
<br>“There's more evidence <b>to</b> come yet, please your Majesty,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked up.”
<br>“What's in <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“I haven't opened <b>it</b> yet, said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> be a letter, written <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prisoner <b>to</b>—<b>to</b> somebody.”
<br>“It must have been that,” said <b>the</b> King, “unless <b>it</b> was written <b>to</b> nobody, which isn't usual, you know.”
<br>“Who is <b>it</b> directed <b>to</b>?” said one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurymen.
<br>“It isn't directed at all,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit; “in fact, there's nothing written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> OUTSIDE.” He unfolded <b>the</b> paper as he spoke, <b>and</b> added “It isn't a letter, after all: <b>it</b>'s a set <b>of</b> verses.”
<br>“Are they in <b>the</b> prisoner's handwriting?” asked another <b>of</b> they jurymen.
<br>“No, they're not,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, “<b>and</b> that's <b>the</b> queerest thing about <b>it</b>.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
<br>“He must have imitated somebody else's hand,” said <b>the</b> King. (The jury all brightened up again.)
<br>“Please your Majesty,” said <b>the</b> Knave, “I didn't write <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> they can't prove I did: there's <b>no</b> name signed at <b>the</b> end.”
<br>“If you didn't sign <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> King, “that only makes <b>the</b> matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, <b>or</b> else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.”
<br>There was a general clapping <b>of</b> hands at this: <b>it</b> was <b>the</b> first really clever thing <b>the</b> King had said that day.
<br>“That PROVES his guilt,” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“It proves nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort!” said <b>Alice</b>. “Why, you don't even know what they're about!”
<br>“Read them,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>The White Rabbit put <b>on</b> his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?” he asked.
<br>“Begin at <b>the</b> beginning,” <b>the</b> King said gravely, “<b>and</b> go <b>on</b> till you come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end: then stop.”
<br>These were <b>the</b> verses <b>the</b> White Rabbit read:—
<br>
<br>“They told me you had been <b>to</b> her,
<br>And mentioned me <b>to</b> him:
<br>She gave me a good character,
<br>But said I could not swim.
<br>He sent them word I had not gone
<br>(We know <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be true):
<br>If she should push <b>the</b> matter <b>on</b>,
<br>What would become <b>of</b> you?
<br>I gave her one, they gave him two,
<br>You gave us three <b>or</b> more;
<br>They all returned from him <b>to</b> you,
<br>Though they were mine before.
<br>If I <b>or</b> she should chance <b>to</b> be
<br>Involved in this affair,
<br>He trusts <b>to</b> you <b>to</b> set them free,
<br>Exactly as we were.
<br>My notion was that you had been
<br>(Before she had this fit)
<br>An obstacle that came between
<br>Him, <b>and</b> ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>Don't let him know she liked them best,
<br>For this must ever be
<br>A secret, kept from all <b>the</b> rest,
<br>Between yourself <b>and</b> me.”
<br>
<br>“That's <b>the</b> most important piece <b>of</b> evidence we've heard yet,” said <b>the</b> King, rubbing his hands; “so now let <b>the</b> jury—”
<br>“If any one <b>of</b> them can explain <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>, (she had grown so large in <b>the</b> last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid <b>of</b> interrupting him,) “I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's an atom <b>of</b> meaning in <b>it</b>.”
<br>The jury all wrote down <b>on</b> their slates, “SHE doesn't believe there's an atom <b>of</b> meaning in <b>it</b>,” <b>but</b> none <b>of</b> them attempted <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> paper.
<br>“If there's <b>no</b> meaning in <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> King, “that saves a world <b>of</b> trouble, you know, as we needn't try <b>to</b> find any. And yet I don't know,” he went <b>on</b>, spreading out <b>the</b> verses <b>on</b> his knee, <b>and</b> looking at them with one eye; “I seem <b>to</b> see some meaning in them, after all. «—SAID I COULD NOT SWIM—» you can't swim, can you?” he added, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave.
<br>The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like <b>it</b>?” he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely <b>of</b> cardboard.)
<br>“All right, so far,” said <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> he went <b>on</b> muttering over <b>the</b> verses <b>to</b> himself: “"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE—» that's <b>the</b> jury, <b>of</b> course— «I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO—» why, that must be what he did with <b>the</b> tarts, you know—”
<br>“But, <b>it</b> goes <b>on</b> «THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"“ said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why, there they are!” said <b>the</b> King triumphantly, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tarts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. “Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again—"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT—» you never had fits, my dear, I think?” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Never!” said <b>the</b> Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at <b>the</b> Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing <b>on</b> his slate with one finger, as he found <b>it</b> made <b>no</b> mark; <b>but</b> he now hastily began again, using <b>the</b> ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as <b>it</b> lasted.)
<br>“Then <b>the</b> words don't FIT you,” said <b>the</b> King, looking round <b>the</b> court with a smile. There was a dead silence.
<br>“It's a pun!” <b>the</b> King added in an offended tone, <b>and</b> everybody laughed, “Let <b>the</b> jury consider their verdict,” <b>the</b> King said, for about <b>the</b> twentieth time that day.
<br>“No, <b>no</b>!” said <b>the</b> Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
<br>“Stuff <b>and</b> nonsense!” said <b>Alice</b> loudly. “The idea <b>of</b> having <b>the</b> sentence first!”
<br>“Hold your tongue!” said <b>the</b> Queen, turning purple.
<br>“I won't!” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Off with her head!” <b>the</b> Queen shouted at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> her voice. Nobody moved.
<br>“Who cares for you?” said <b>Alice</b>, (she had grown <b>to</b> her full size <b>by</b> this time.) “You're nothing <b>but</b> a pack <b>of</b> cards!”
<br>At this <b>the</b> whole pack rose up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half <b>of</b> fright <b>and</b> half <b>of</b> anger, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> beat them off, <b>and</b> found herself lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bank, with her head in <b>the</b> lap <b>of</b> her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from <b>the</b> trees upon her face.
<br>“Wake up, <b>Alice</b> dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you've had!”
<br>“Oh, I've had such a curious dream!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures <b>of</b> hers that you have just been reading about; <b>and</b> when she had finished, her sister kissed her, <b>and</b> said, “It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: <b>but</b> now run in <b>to</b> your tea; <b>it</b>'s getting late.” So <b>Alice</b> got up <b>and</b> ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream <b>it</b> had been.
<br>But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head <b>on</b> her hand, watching <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>and</b> thinking <b>of</b> little <b>Alice</b> <b>and</b> all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, <b>and</b> this was her dream:—
<br>First, she dreamed <b>of</b> little <b>Alice</b> herself, <b>and</b> once again <b>the</b> tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bright eager eyes were looking up <b>into</b> hers—she could hear <b>the</b> very tones <b>of</b> her voice, <b>and</b> see that queer little toss <b>of</b> her head <b>to</b> keep back <b>the</b> wandering hair that WOULD always get <b>into</b> her eyes—<b>and</b> still as she listened, <b>or</b> seemed <b>to</b> listen, <b>the</b> whole place around her became alive <b>the</b> strange creatures <b>of</b> her little sister's dream.
<br>The long grass rustled at her feet as <b>the</b> White Rabbit hurried <b>by</b>—<b>the</b> frightened Mouse splashed his way through <b>the</b> neighbouring pool—she could hear <b>the</b> rattle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacups as <b>the</b> March Hare <b>and</b> his friends shared their never-ending meal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shrill voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests <b>to</b> execution—once more <b>the</b> pig-baby was sneezing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Duchess's knee, while plates <b>and</b> dishes crashed around <b>it</b>—once more <b>the</b> shriek <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>the</b> squeaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lizard's slate-pencil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> choking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppressed guinea-pigs, filled <b>the</b> air, mixed up with <b>the</b> distant sobs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miserable Mock Turtle.
<br>So she sat <b>on</b>, with closed eyes, <b>and</b> half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had <b>but</b> <b>to</b> open them again, <b>and</b> all would change <b>to</b> dull reality—<b>the</b> grass would be only rustling in <b>the</b> wind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pool rippling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reeds—<b>the</b> rattling teacups would change <b>to</b> tinkling sheep- bells, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen's shrill cries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shepherd boy—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> sneeze <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby, <b>the</b> shriek <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confused clamour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> busy farm-yard—while <b>the</b> lowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle in <b>the</b> distance would take <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
<br>Lastly, she pictured <b>to</b> herself how this same little sister <b>of</b> hers would, in <b>the</b> after-time, be herself a grown woman; <b>and</b> how she would keep, through all her riper years, <b>the</b> simple <b>and</b> loving heart <b>of</b> her childhood: <b>and</b> how she would gather about her other little children, <b>and</b> make THEIR eyes bright <b>and</b> eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with <b>the</b> dream <b>of</b> Wonderland <b>of</b> long ago: <b>and</b> how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, <b>and</b> find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> happy summer days.
