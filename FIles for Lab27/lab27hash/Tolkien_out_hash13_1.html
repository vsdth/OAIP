<br>FOREWORD
<br>   
<br>   This tale grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> telling, until <b>it</b> became a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> included many glimpses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yet more ancient history that preceded <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> begun soon after The Hobbit <b>was</b> written <b>and</b> before its publication <b>in</b> 1937; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> did not go <b>on</b> with this sequel, for <b>I</b> wished first <b>to</b> complete <b>and</b> set <b>in</b> order <b>the</b> mythology <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, which <b>had</b> then been taking shape for some years. <b>I</b> desired <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this for my own satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> little hope that other people would be interested <b>in</b> this work, especially since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> primarily linguistic <b>in</b> inspiration <b>and</b> <b>was</b> begun <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> necessary background <b>of</b> “history” for Elvish tongues.
<br>   When those whose advice <b>and</b> opinion <b>I</b> sought corrected little hope <b>to</b> <b>no</b> hope, <b>I</b> went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sequel, encouraged <b>by</b> requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits <b>and</b> their adventures. But <b>the</b> story <b>was</b> drawn irresistibly towards <b>the</b> older world, <b>and</b> became an account, as <b>it</b> were, <b>of</b> its end <b>and</b> passing away before its <b>beginning</b> <b>and</b> middle <b>had</b> been told. The process <b>had</b> begun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writing <b>of</b> The Hobbit, <b>in</b> which there were already some references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, <b>the</b> High-elves, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> orcs, as well as glimpses that <b>had</b> arisen unbidden <b>of</b> things higher <b>or</b> deeper <b>or</b> darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, <b>the</b> Necromancer, <b>the</b> Ring. The discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> these glimpses <b>and</b> <b>of</b> their relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancient histories revealed <b>the</b> Third Age <b>and</b> its culmination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   Those who <b>had</b> asked for more information about hobbits eventually got <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait a long time; for <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings went <b>on</b> at intervals during <b>the</b> years 1936 <b>to</b> 1949, a period <b>in</b> which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> many duties that <b>I</b> did not neglect, <b>and</b> many other interests as a learner <b>and</b> teacher that often absorbed me. The delay <b>was</b>, <b>of</b> course, also increased <b>by</b> <b>the</b> outbreak <b>of</b> war <b>in</b> 1939, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> which year <b>the</b> tale <b>had</b> not yet reached <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Book One. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next five years <b>I</b> found that <b>the</b> story could not now be wholly abandoned, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> plodded <b>on</b>, mostly <b>by</b> night, till <b>I</b> stood <b>by</b> Balin's tomb <b>in</b> Moria. There <b>I</b> halted for a long while. It <b>was</b> almost a year later when <b>I</b> went <b>on</b> <b>and</b> so came <b>to</b> Lothl?rien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River late <b>in</b> 1941. In <b>the</b> next year <b>I</b> wrote <b>the</b> first drafts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matter that now stands as Book Three, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> chapters <b>I</b> <b>and</b> III <b>of</b> Book Five; <b>and</b> there as <b>the</b> beacons flared <b>in</b> An?rien <b>and</b> Th?oden came <b>to</b> Harrowdale <b>I</b> stopped. Foresight <b>had</b> failed <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> time for <b>thought</b>.
<br>   It <b>was</b> during 1944 that, leaving <b>the</b> loose ends <b>and</b> perplexities <b>of</b> a war which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my task <b>to</b> conduct, <b>or</b> at least <b>to</b> report, <b>I</b> forced myself <b>to</b> tackle <b>the</b> journey <b>of</b> Frodo <b>to</b> Mordor. These chapters, eventually <b>to</b> become Book Four, were written <b>and</b> sent out as a serial <b>to</b> my son, Christopher, then <b>in</b> South Africa with <b>the</b> RAF. Nonetheless <b>it</b> took another five years before <b>the</b> tale <b>was</b> brought <b>to</b> its present end; <b>in</b> that time <b>I</b> changed my house, my chair, <b>and</b> my college, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> days though less dark were <b>no</b> less laborious. Then when <b>the</b> “end” <b>had</b> at last been reached <b>the</b> whole story <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be revised, <b>and</b> indeed largely re-written backwards. And <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be typed, <b>and</b> re-typed: <b>by</b> me; <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> professional typing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ten-fingered <b>was</b> beyond my means.
<br>   The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings has been read <b>by</b> many people since <b>it</b> finally appeared <b>in</b> print; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> say something here with reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> many opinions <b>or</b> guesses that <b>I</b> have received <b>or</b> have read concerning <b>the</b> motives <b>and</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale. The prime motive <b>was</b> <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> a tale-teller <b>to</b> try his hand at a really long story that would hold <b>the</b> attention <b>of</b> readers, amuse them, delight them, <b>and</b> at times maybe excite them <b>or</b> deeply move them. As a guide <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only my own feelings for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> appealing <b>or</b> moving, <b>and</b> for many <b>the</b> guide <b>was</b> inevitably often at fault. Some who have read <b>the</b> <b>book</b>, <b>or</b> at any rate have reviewed <b>it</b>, have found <b>it</b> boring, absurd, <b>or</b> contemptible; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>no</b> cause <b>to</b> complain, since <b>I</b> have similar opinions <b>of</b> their works, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> writing that they evidently prefer. But even from <b>the</b> points <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> many who have enjoyed my story there <b>is</b> much that fails <b>to</b> please. It <b>is</b> perhaps not possible <b>in</b> a long tale <b>to</b> please everybody at all points, nor <b>to</b> displease everybody at <b>the</b> same points; for <b>I</b> find from <b>the</b> letters that <b>I</b> have received that <b>the</b> passages <b>or</b> chapters that are <b>to</b> some a blemish are all <b>by</b> others specially approved. The most critical reader <b>of</b> all, myself, now finds many defects, minor <b>and</b> major, <b>but</b> being fortunately under <b>no</b> obligation either <b>to</b> review <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>or</b> <b>to</b> write <b>it</b> again, he will pass over these <b>in</b> silence, except one that has been noted <b>by</b> others: <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>is</b> too short.
<br>   As for any inner meaning <b>or</b> “message”, <b>it</b> has <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author none. It <b>is</b> neither allegorical nor topical. As <b>the</b> story grew <b>it</b> put down roots (<b>into</b> <b>the</b> past) <b>and</b> threw out unexpected branches: <b>but</b> its main theme <b>was</b> settled from <b>the</b> outset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inevitable choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring as <b>the</b> link between <b>it</b> <b>and</b> The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, “The Shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Past”, <b>is</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale. It <b>was</b> written long before <b>the</b> foreshadow <b>of</b> 1939 <b>had</b> yet become a threat <b>of</b> inevitable disaster, <b>and</b> from that point <b>the</b> story would have developed along essentially <b>the</b> same lines, if that disaster <b>had</b> been averted. Its sources are things long before <b>in</b> mind, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> some cases already written, <b>and</b> little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> modified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> war that began <b>in</b> 1939 <b>or</b> its sequels.
<br>   The real war does not resemble <b>the</b> legendary war <b>in</b> its process <b>or</b> its conclusion. If <b>it</b> <b>had</b> inspired <b>or</b> directed <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legend, then certainly <b>the</b> Ring would have been seized <b>and</b> used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated <b>but</b> enslaved, <b>and</b> Barad-d?r would not have been destroyed <b>but</b> occupied. Saruman, failing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, would m <b>the</b> confusion <b>and</b> treacheries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time have found <b>in</b> Mordor <b>the</b> missing links <b>in</b> his own researches <b>into</b> Ring-lore, <b>and</b> before long he would have made a Great Ring <b>of</b> his own with which <b>to</b> challenge <b>the</b> self-styled Ruler <b>of</b> Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits <b>in</b> hatred <b>and</b> contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.
<br>   Other arrangements could be devised according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tastes <b>or</b> views <b>of</b> those who like allegory <b>or</b> topical reference. But <b>I</b> cordially dislike allegory <b>in</b> all its manifestations, <b>and</b> always have done so since <b>I</b> grew old <b>and</b> wary enough <b>to</b> detect its presence. <b>I</b> much prefer history, true <b>or</b> feigned, with its varied applicability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> experience <b>of</b> readers. <b>I</b> think that many confuse “applicability” with “allegory”; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> one resides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reader, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> purposed domination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author.
<br>   An author cannot <b>of</b> course remain wholly unaffected <b>by</b> his experience, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which a story-germ uses <b>the</b> soil <b>of</b> experience are extremely complex, <b>and</b> attempts <b>to</b> define <b>the</b> process are at best guesses from evidence that <b>is</b> inadequate <b>and</b> ambiguous. It <b>is</b> also false, though naturally attractive, when <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> an author <b>and</b> critic have overlapped, <b>to</b> suppose that <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> times common <b>to</b> both were necessarily <b>the</b> most powerful influences. One has indeed personally <b>to</b> come under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> war <b>to</b> feel fully its oppression; <b>but</b> as <b>the</b> years go <b>by</b> <b>it</b> seems now often forgotten that <b>to</b> be caught <b>in</b> youth <b>by</b> 1914 <b>was</b> <b>no</b> less hideous an experience than <b>to</b> be involved <b>in</b> 1939 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following years. By 1918 all <b>but</b> one <b>of</b> my close friends were dead. Or <b>to</b> take a less grievous matter: <b>it</b> has been supposed <b>by</b> some that “The Scouring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire” reflects <b>the</b> situation <b>in</b> England at <b>the</b> time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> finishing my tale. It does not. It <b>is</b> an essential part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot, foreseen from <b>the</b> outset, though <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event modified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Saruman as developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story <b>without</b>, need <b>I</b> say, any allegorical significance <b>or</b> contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some basis <b>in</b> experience, though slender (for <b>the</b> economic situation <b>was</b> entirely different), <b>and</b> much further back. The country <b>in</b> which <b>I</b> lived <b>in</b> childhood <b>was</b> being shabbily destroyed before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ten, <b>in</b> days when motor-cars were rare objects (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen one) <b>and</b> men were still building suburban railways. Recently <b>I</b> saw <b>in</b> a paper a picture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last decrepitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>once</b> thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed <b>to</b> me so important. <b>I</b> never liked <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Young miller, <b>but</b> his father, <b>the</b> Old miller, <b>had</b> a black beard, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> not named Sandyman.
<br>   The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings <b>is</b> now issued <b>in</b> a new edition, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opportunity has been taken <b>of</b> revising <b>it</b>. A number <b>of</b> errors <b>and</b> inconsistencies that still remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> text have been corrected, <b>and</b> an attempt has been made <b>to</b> provide information <b>on</b> a few points which attentive readers have raised. <b>I</b> have considered all their comments <b>and</b> enquiries, <b>and</b> if some seem <b>to</b> have been passed over that may be because <b>I</b> have failed <b>to</b> keep my notes <b>in</b> order; <b>but</b> many enquiries could only be answered <b>by</b> additional appendices, <b>or</b> indeed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> an accessory volume containing much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material that <b>I</b> did not include <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original edition, <b>in</b> particular more detailed linguistic information. In <b>the</b> meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prologue, some notes, <b>and</b> an index <b>of</b> <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> persons <b>and</b> places. This index <b>is</b> <b>in</b> intention complete <b>in</b> items <b>but</b> not <b>in</b> references, since for <b>the</b> present purpose <b>it</b> has been necessary <b>to</b> reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material prepared for me <b>by</b> Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accessory volume.

<br>PROLOGUE
<br>
<br>1. Concerning Hobbits
<br>   
<br>   This <b>book</b> <b>is</b> largely concerned with Hobbits, <b>and</b> from its pages a reader may discover much <b>of</b> their character <b>and</b> a little <b>of</b> their history. Further information will also be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> selection from <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch that has already been published, under <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> The Hobbit. That story <b>was</b> derived from <b>the</b> earlier chapters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book, composed <b>by</b> Bilbo himself, <b>the</b> first Hobbit <b>to</b> become famous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world at large, <b>and</b> called <b>by</b> him There <b>and</b> Back Again, since they told <b>of</b> his journey <b>into</b> <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> his return: an adventure which later involved all <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great events <b>of</b> that Age that are here related.
<br>   Many, however, may wish <b>to</b> know more about this remarkable people from <b>the</b> outset, while some may not possess <b>the</b> earlier <b>book</b>. For such readers a few notes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first adventure <b>is</b> briefly recalled.
<br>   Hobbits are an unobtrusive <b>but</b> <b>very</b> ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace <b>and</b> quiet <b>and</b> good tilled earth: a well-ordered <b>and</b> well-farmed countryside <b>was</b> their favourite haunt. They <b>do</b> not <b>and</b> did not understand <b>or</b> like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, <b>or</b> a hand-loom, though they were skilful with tools. Even <b>in</b> ancient days they were, as a rule, shy <b>of</b> “<b>the</b> Big Folk”, as they call us, <b>and</b> now they avoid us with dismay <b>and</b> are becoming hard <b>to</b> find. They are quick <b>of</b> hearing <b>and</b> sharp-eyed, <b>and</b> though they are inclined <b>to</b> be fat <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble <b>and</b> deft <b>in</b> their movements. They possessed from <b>the</b> first <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> disappearing swiftly <b>and</b> silently, when large folk whom they <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> meet come blundering <b>by</b>; <b>and</b> this an they have developed until <b>to</b> Men <b>it</b> may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, <b>in</b> fact, studied magic <b>of</b> any kind, <b>and</b> their elusiveness <b>is</b> due solely <b>to</b> a professional skill that heredity <b>and</b> practice, <b>and</b> a close friendship with <b>the</b> earth, have rendered inimitable <b>by</b> bigger <b>and</b> clumsier races.
<br>   For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout <b>and</b> stocky, that <b>is</b>, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height <b>is</b> variable, ranging between two <b>and</b> four feet <b>of</b> our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; <b>but</b> they hive dwindled, they say, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> ancient days they were taller. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son <b>of</b> Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, <b>was</b> four foot five <b>and</b> able <b>to</b> ride a horse. He <b>was</b> surpassed <b>in</b> all Hobbit records only <b>by</b> two famous characters <b>of</b> old; <b>but</b> that curious matter <b>is</b> dealt with <b>in</b> this <b>book</b>.
<br>   As for <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> their peace <b>and</b> prosperity they were a merry folk. They dressed <b>in</b> bright colours, being notably fond <b>of</b> yellow <b>and</b> green; <b>but</b> they seldom wore shoes, since their feet <b>had</b> tough leathery soles <b>and</b> were clad <b>in</b> a thick curling hair, much like <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> their heads, which <b>was</b> commonly brown. Thus, <b>the</b> only craft little practised among them <b>was</b> shoe-making; <b>but</b> they <b>had</b> long <b>and</b> skilful fingers <b>and</b> could make many other useful <b>and</b> comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt <b>to</b> laughter, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking. And laugh they did, <b>and</b> eat, <b>and</b> drink, often <b>and</b> heartily, being fond <b>of</b> simple jests at all times, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> six meals a day (when they could <b>get</b> them). They were hospitable <b>and</b> delighted <b>in</b> parties, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> presents, which they gave away freely <b>and</b> eagerly accepted.
<br>   It <b>is</b> plain indeed that <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> later estrangement Hobbits are relatives <b>of</b> ours: far nearer <b>to</b> us than Elves, <b>or</b> even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> Men, after their own fashion, <b>and</b> liked <b>and</b> disliked much <b>the</b> same things as Men did. But <b>what</b> exactly our relationship <b>is</b> can <b>no</b> longer be discovered. The <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> Hobbits lies far back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days that are now lost <b>and</b> forgotten. Only <b>the</b> Elves still preserve any records <b>of</b> that vanished time, <b>and</b> their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, <b>in</b> which Men appear seldom <b>and</b> Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear that Hobbits <b>had</b>, <b>in</b> fact, lived quietly <b>in</b> Middle-earth for many long years before other folk became even aware <b>of</b> them. And <b>the</b> world being after all full <b>of</b> strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed <b>of</b> <b>very</b> little importance. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, <b>by</b> <b>no</b> wish <b>of</b> their own, both important <b>and</b> renowned, <b>and</b> troubled <b>the</b> counsels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great.
<br>   Those days, <b>the</b> Third Age <b>of</b> Middle-earth, are now long past, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> all lands has been changed; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> regions <b>in</b> which Hobbits then lived were doubtless <b>the</b> same as those <b>in</b> which they still linger: <b>the</b> North-West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old World, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. Of their original home <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>in</b> Bilbo's time preserved <b>no</b> knowledge. A love <b>of</b> learning (other than genealogical lore) <b>was</b> far from general among them, <b>but</b> there remained still a few <b>in</b> <b>the</b> older families who studied their own books, <b>and</b> even gathered reports <b>of</b> old times <b>and</b> distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, <b>and</b> Men. Their own records began only after <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days. It <b>is</b> clear, nonetheless, from these legends, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> evidence <b>of</b> their peculiar words <b>and</b> customs, that like many other folk Hobbits <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem <b>to</b> glimpse a time when they dwelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper vales <b>of</b> Anduin, between <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> Greenwood <b>the</b> Great <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook <b>the</b> hard <b>and</b> perilous crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>into</b> Eriador <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer certain. Their own accounts speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multiplying <b>of</b> Men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> a shadow that fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest, so that <b>it</b> became darkened <b>and</b> its new name <b>was</b> Mirkwood.
<br>   Before <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>had</b> already become divided <b>into</b> three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, <b>and</b> Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner <b>of</b> skin, smaller, <b>and</b> shorter, <b>and</b> they were beardless <b>and</b> bootless; their hands <b>and</b> feet were neat <b>and</b> nimble; <b>and</b> they preferred highlands <b>and</b> hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier <b>in</b> build; their feet <b>and</b> hands were larger, <b>and</b> they preferred flat lands <b>and</b> riversides. The Fallohides were fairer <b>of</b> skin <b>and</b> also <b>of</b> hair, <b>and</b> they were taller <b>and</b> slimmer than <b>the</b> others; they were lovers <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>of</b> woodlands.
<br>   The Harfoots <b>had</b> much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Dwarves <b>in</b> ancient times, <b>and</b> long lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foothills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. They moved westward early, <b>and</b> roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while <b>the</b> others were still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wilderland. They were <b>the</b> most normal <b>and</b> representative variety <b>of</b> Hobbit, <b>and</b> far <b>the</b> most numerous. They were <b>the</b> most inclined <b>to</b> settle <b>in</b> one place, <b>and</b> longest preserved their ancestral habit <b>of</b> living <b>in</b> tunnels <b>and</b> holes.
<br>   The Stoors lingered long <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River Anduin, <b>and</b> were less shy <b>of</b> Men. They came west after <b>the</b> Harfoots <b>and</b> followed <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loudwater southwards; <b>and</b> there many <b>of</b> them long dwelt between Tharbad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Dunland before they moved north again.
<br>   The Fallohides, <b>the</b> least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with Elves than <b>the</b> other Hobbits were, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> more skill <b>in</b> language <b>and</b> song than <b>in</b> handicrafts; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old they preferred hunting <b>to</b> tilling. They crossed <b>the</b> mountains north <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>and</b> came down <b>the</b> River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with <b>the</b> other kinds that <b>had</b> preceded them, <b>but</b> being somewhat bolder <b>and</b> more adventurous, they were often found as leaders <b>or</b> chieftains among clans <b>of</b> Harfoots <b>or</b> Stoors. Even <b>in</b> Bilbo's time <b>the</b> strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among <b>the</b> greater families, such as <b>the</b> Tooks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Masters <b>of</b> Buckland.
<br>   In <b>the</b> westlands <b>of</b> Eriador, between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Lune, <b>the</b> Hobbits found both Men <b>and</b> Elves. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, <b>the</b> kings <b>of</b> Men that came over <b>the</b> Sea out <b>of</b> Westernesse; <b>but</b> they were dwindling fast <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lands <b>of</b> their North Kingdom were falling far <b>and</b> wide <b>into</b> waste. There <b>was</b> room <b>and</b> <b>to</b> spare for incomers, <b>and</b> ere long <b>the</b> Hobbits began <b>to</b> settle <b>in</b> ordered communities. Most <b>of</b> their earlier settlements <b>had</b> long disappeared <b>and</b> been forgotten <b>in</b> Bilbo's time; <b>but</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> become important still endured, though reduced <b>in</b> size; this <b>was</b> at Bree <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chetwood that lay round about, some forty miles east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> these early days, doubtless, that <b>the</b> Hobbits learned their letters <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> write after <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, who <b>had</b> <b>in</b> their turn long before learned <b>the</b> art from <b>the</b> Elves. And <b>in</b> those days also they forgot whatever languages they <b>had</b> used before, <b>and</b> spoke ever after <b>the</b> Common Speech, <b>the</b> Westron as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named, that <b>was</b> current through all <b>the</b> lands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings from Arnor <b>to</b> Gondor, <b>and</b> about all <b>the</b> coasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea from Belfalas <b>to</b> Lune. Yet they kept a few words <b>of</b> their own, as well as their own names <b>of</b> months <b>and</b> days, <b>and</b> a great store <b>of</b> personal names out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.
<br>   About this time legend among <b>the</b> Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning <b>of</b> years. For <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one thousand six hundred <b>and</b> first year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age that <b>the</b> Fallohide brothers, Marcho <b>and</b> Blanco, set out from Bree; <b>and</b> <b>having</b> obtained permission from <b>the</b> high king at Fornost1, they crossed <b>the</b> brown river Baranduin with a great following <b>of</b> Hobbits. They passed over <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Stonebows, that <b>had</b> been built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom, <b>and</b> they took ail <b>the</b> land beyond <b>to</b> dwell <b>in</b>, between <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Far Downs. All that <b>was</b> demanded <b>of</b> them <b>was</b> that they should keep <b>the</b> Great Bridge <b>in</b> repair, <b>and</b> all other bridges <b>and</b> roads, speed <b>the</b> king's messengers, <b>and</b> acknowledge his lordship.
<br>   Thus began <b>the</b> Shire-reckoning, for <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine (as <b>the</b> Hobbits turned <b>the</b> name) became Year One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> all later dates were reckoned from <b>it</b>.2 At <b>once</b> <b>the</b> western Hobbits fell <b>in</b> love with their new land, <b>and</b> they remained there, <b>and</b> soon passed <b>once</b> more out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Elves. While there <b>was</b> still a king they were <b>in</b> name his subjects, <b>but</b> they were, <b>in</b> fact, ruled <b>by</b> their own chieftains <b>and</b> meddled not at all with events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world outside. To <b>the</b> last battle at Fornost with <b>the</b> Witch-lord <b>of</b> Angmar they sent some bowmen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, <b>or</b> so they maintained, though <b>no</b> tales <b>of</b> Men record <b>it</b>. But <b>in</b> that war <b>the</b> North Kingdom ended; <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Hobbits took <b>the</b> land for their own, <b>and</b> they chose from their own chiefs a Thain <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king that <b>was</b> gone. There for a thousand years they were little troubled <b>by</b> wars, <b>and</b> they prospered <b>and</b> multiplied after <b>the</b> Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until <b>the</b> disaster <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Long Winter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> famine that followed <b>it</b>. Many thousands then perished, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Days <b>of</b> Dearth (1158-60) were at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> this tale long past <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>had</b> again become accustomed <b>to</b> plenty. The land <b>was</b> rich <b>and</b> kindly, <b>and</b> though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> long been deserted when they entered <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> before been well tilled, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> king <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> many farms, cornlands, vineyards, <b>and</b> woods.
<br>   Forty leagues <b>it</b> stretched from <b>the</b> Far Downs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge, <b>and</b> fifty from <b>the</b> northern moors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marshes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. The Hobbits named <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Shire, as <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> their Thain, <b>and</b> a district <b>of</b> well-ordered business; <b>and</b> there <b>in</b> that pleasant comer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world they plied their well-ordered business <b>of</b> living, <b>and</b> they heeded less <b>and</b> less <b>the</b> world outside where dark things moved, until they came <b>to</b> think that peace <b>and</b> plenty were <b>the</b> rule <b>in</b> Middle-earth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> all sensible folk. They forgot <b>or</b> ignored <b>what</b> little they <b>had</b> ever known <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Guardians, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labours <b>of</b> those that made possible <b>the</b> long peace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. They were, <b>in</b> fact, sheltered, <b>but</b> they <b>had</b> ceased <b>to</b> remember <b>it</b>.
<br>   At <b>no</b> time <b>had</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> any kind been warlike, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> never fought among themselves. In olden days they <b>had</b>, <b>of</b> course, been often obliged <b>to</b> fight <b>to</b> maintain themselves <b>in</b> a hard world; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> Bilbo's time that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, <b>and</b> indeed <b>the</b> only one that <b>had</b> ever been fought within <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>was</b> beyond living memory: <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Greenfields, S.R. 1147, <b>in</b> which Bandobras Took routed an invasion <b>of</b> Orcs. Even <b>the</b> weathers <b>had</b> grown milder, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wolves that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> come ravening out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North <b>in</b> bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there <b>was</b> still some store <b>of</b> weapons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths <b>or</b> <b>on</b> walls, <b>or</b> gathered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house <b>it</b> <b>was</b> called; for anything that Hobbits <b>had</b> <b>no</b> immediate <b>use</b> for, <b>but</b> were unwilling <b>to</b> throw away, they called a mathom. Their dwellings were apt <b>to</b> become rather crowded with mathoms, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presents that passed from hand <b>to</b> hand were <b>of</b> that sort.
<br>   Nonetheless, ease <b>and</b> peace <b>had</b> left this people still curiously tough. They were, if <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, difficult <b>to</b> daunt <b>or</b> <b>to</b> kill; <b>and</b> they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond <b>of</b> good things not least because they could, when put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, <b>do</b> <b>without</b> them, <b>and</b> could survive rough handling <b>by</b> grief, foe, <b>or</b> weather <b>in</b> a way that astonished those who did not know them well <b>and</b> looked <b>no</b> further than their bellies <b>and</b> their well-fed faces. Though slow <b>to</b> quarrel, <b>and</b> for sport killing <b>nothing</b> that lived, they were doughty at bay, <b>and</b> at need could still handle arms. They shot well with <b>the</b> bow, for they were keen-eyed <b>and</b> sure at <b>the</b> mark. Not only with bows <b>and</b> arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well <b>to</b> <b>get</b> quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew <b>very</b> well.
<br>   All Hobbits <b>had</b> originally lived <b>in</b> holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>or</b> so they believed, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> such dwellings they still felt most at home; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> time they <b>had</b> been obliged <b>to</b> adopt other forms <b>of</b> abode. Actually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> Bilbo's days <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, as a rule, only <b>the</b> richest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poorest Hobbits that maintained <b>the</b> old custom. The poorest went <b>on</b> living <b>in</b> burrows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window <b>or</b> none; while <b>the</b> well-<b>to</b>-<b>do</b> still constructed more luxurious versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple diggings <b>of</b> old. But suitable sites for these large <b>and</b> ramifying tunnels (<b>or</b> smials as they called them) were not everywhere <b>to</b> be found; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> low-lying districts <b>the</b> Hobbits, as they multiplied, began <b>to</b> build above ground. Indeed, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hilly regions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older villages, such as Hobbiton <b>or</b> Tuckborough, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chief township <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, Michel Delving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> White Downs, there were now many houses <b>of</b> wood, brick, <b>or</b> stone. These were specially favoured <b>by</b> millers, smiths, ropers, <b>and</b> cartwrights, <b>and</b> others <b>of</b> that sort; for even when they <b>had</b> holes <b>to</b> live <b>in</b>. Hobbits <b>had</b> long been accustomed <b>to</b> build sheds <b>and</b> workshops.
<br>   The habit <b>of</b> building farmhouses <b>and</b> barns <b>was</b> said <b>to</b> have begun among <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine. The Hobbits <b>of</b> that quarter, <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, were rather large <b>and</b> heavy-legged, <b>and</b> they wore dwarf-boots <b>in</b> muddy weather. But they were well known <b>to</b> be Stoors <b>in</b> a large part <b>of</b> their blood, as indeed <b>was</b> shown <b>by</b> <b>the</b> down that many grew <b>on</b> their chins. No Harfoot <b>or</b> Fallohide <b>had</b> any trace <b>of</b> a beard. Indeed, <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Buckland, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, which they afterwards occupied, came for <b>the</b> most part later <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Shire up from south-away; <b>and</b> they still <b>had</b> many peculiar names <b>and</b> strange words not found elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   It <b>is</b> probable that <b>the</b> craft <b>of</b> building, as many other crafts beside, <b>was</b> derived from <b>the</b> D?nedain. But <b>the</b> Hobbits may have learned <b>it</b> direct from <b>the</b> Elves, <b>the</b> teachers <b>of</b> Men <b>in</b> their youth. For <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Kindred <b>had</b> not yet forsaken Middle-earth, <b>and</b> they dwelt still at that time at <b>the</b> Grey Havens away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> other places within reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Three Elf-towers <b>of</b> immemorial age were still <b>to</b> be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tower Hills beyond <b>the</b> western marches. They shone far off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight. The tallest <b>was</b> furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Westfarthing said that one could see <b>the</b> Sea from <b>the</b> lop <b>of</b> that tower; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> Hobbit <b>had</b> ever been known <b>to</b> climb <b>it</b>. Indeed, few Hobbits <b>had</b> ever seen <b>or</b> sailed upon <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> fewer still <b>had</b> ever returned <b>to</b> report <b>it</b>. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers <b>and</b> small boats with deep misgivings, <b>and</b> not many <b>of</b> them could swim. And as <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire lengthened they spoke less <b>and</b> less with <b>the</b> Elves, <b>and</b> grew afraid <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> distrustful <b>of</b> those that <b>had</b> dealings with them; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea became a word <b>of</b> fear among them, <b>and</b> a token <b>of</b> death, <b>and</b> they turned their faces away from <b>the</b> hills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west.
<br>   The craft <b>of</b> building may have come from Elves <b>or</b> Men, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits used <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their own fashion. They did not go <b>in</b> for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, <b>and</b> comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, <b>no</b> more than built imitations <b>of</b> smials, thatched with dry grass <b>or</b> straw, <b>or</b> roofed with turves, <b>and</b> <b>having</b> walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> hobbit-building <b>had</b> long since been altered, improved <b>by</b> devices, learned from Dwarves, <b>or</b> discovered <b>by</b> themselves. A preference for round windows, <b>and</b> even round doors, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> chief remaining peculiarity <b>of</b> hobbit-architecture.
<br>   The houses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> holes <b>of</b> Shire-hobbits were often large, <b>and</b> inhabited <b>by</b> large families. (Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo Baggins were as bachelors <b>very</b> exceptional, as they were also <b>in</b> many other ways, such as their friendship with <b>the</b> Elves.) Sometimes, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tooks <b>of</b> Great Smials, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>of</b> Brandy Hall, many generations <b>of</b> relatives lived <b>in</b> (comparative) peace together <b>in</b> one ancestral <b>and</b> many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, <b>in</b> any case, clannish <b>and</b> reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long <b>and</b> elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In dealing with Hobbits <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> remember who <b>is</b> related <b>to</b> whom, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> degree. It would be impossible <b>in</b> this <b>book</b> <b>to</b> set out a family-tree that included even <b>the</b> more important members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more important families at <b>the</b> time which these tales tell <b>of</b>. The genealogical trees at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch are a small <b>book</b> <b>in</b> themselves, <b>and</b> all <b>but</b> Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted <b>in</b> such things, if they were accurate: they liked <b>to</b> have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair <b>and</b> square with <b>no</b> contradictions.
<br>   
<br>
<br>2. Concerning Pipe-weed
<br>   
<br>   There <b>is</b> another astonishing thing about Hobbits <b>of</b> old that must be mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed <b>or</b> inhaled, through pipes <b>of</b> clay <b>or</b> wood, <b>the</b> smoke <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burning leaves <b>of</b> a herb, which they called pipe-weed <b>or</b> leaf, a variety probably <b>of</b> Nicotiana. A great deal <b>of</b> mystery surrounds <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> this peculiar custom, <b>or</b> “art” as <b>the</b> Hobbits preferred <b>to</b> call <b>it</b>. All that could be discovered about <b>it</b> <b>in</b> antiquity <b>was</b> put together <b>by</b> Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master <b>of</b> Buckland), <b>and</b> since he <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tobacco <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing play a part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history that follows, his remarks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> introduction <b>to</b> his Herblore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire may be quoted.
<br>   “This,” he says, “<b>is</b> <b>the</b> one art that we can certainly claim <b>to</b> be our own invention. When Hobbits first began <b>to</b> smoke <b>is</b> not known, all <b>the</b> legends <b>and</b> family histories take <b>it</b> for granted; for ages folk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower <b>of</b> Longbottom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing first grew <b>the</b> true pipe-weed <b>in</b> his gardens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, about <b>the</b> year 1070 <b>of</b> Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, especially <b>the</b> varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, <b>and</b> Southern Star.
<br>   “How Old Toby came <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plant <b>is</b> not recorded, for <b>to</b> his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> traveller. It <b>is</b> said that <b>in</b> his youth he went often <b>to</b> Bree, though he certainly never went further from <b>the</b> Shire than that. It <b>is</b> thus quite possible that he learned <b>of</b> this plant <b>in</b> Bree, where now, at any rate, <b>it</b> grows well <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. The Bree-hobbits claim <b>to</b> have been <b>the</b> first actual smokers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe-weed. They claim, <b>of</b> course, <b>to</b> have done everything before <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, whom they refer <b>to</b> as “colonists"; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> this case their claim <b>is</b>, <b>I</b> think, likely <b>to</b> be true. And certainly <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from Bree that <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> smoking <b>the</b> genuine weed spread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent centuries among Dwarves <b>and</b> such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, <b>or</b> wanderers, as still passed <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home <b>and</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> an <b>is</b> thus <b>to</b> be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old inn <b>of</b> Bree, The Prancing Pony, that has been kept <b>by</b> <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> Butterbur from time beyond record.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same, observations that <b>I</b> have made <b>on</b> my own many journeys south have convinced me that <b>the</b> weed itself <b>is</b> not native <b>to</b> our parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>but</b> came northward from <b>the</b> lower Anduin, whither <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, <b>I</b> suspect, originally brought over Sea <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse. It grows abundantly <b>in</b> Gondor, <b>and</b> there <b>is</b> richer <b>and</b> larger than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> never found wild, <b>and</b> flourishes only <b>in</b> warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men <b>of</b> Gondor call <b>it</b> sweet galenas, <b>and</b> esteem <b>it</b> only for <b>the</b> fragrance <b>of</b> its flowers. From that land <b>it</b> must have been carried up <b>the</b> Greenway during <b>the</b> long centuries between <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> our own day. But even <b>the</b> D?nedain <b>of</b> Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits first put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> pipes. Not even <b>the</b> Wizards first <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that before we did. Though one Wizard that <b>I</b> knew took up <b>the</b> art long ago, <b>and</b> became as skilful <b>in</b> <b>it</b> as <b>in</b> all other things that he put his mind <b>to</b>.”
<br>
<br>
<br>3. Of <b>the</b> Ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire
<br>   
<br>   The Shire <b>was</b> divided <b>into</b> four quarters, <b>the</b> Farthings already referred <b>to</b>. North, South, East, <b>and</b> West; <b>and</b> these again each <b>into</b> a number <b>of</b> folklands, which still bore <b>the</b> names <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old leading families, although <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> this history these names were <b>no</b> longer found only <b>in</b> their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tookland, <b>but</b> that <b>was</b> not true <b>of</b> many other families, such as <b>the</b> Bagginses <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Boffins. Outside <b>the</b> Farthings were <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> West Marches: <b>the</b> Buckland (see <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>Chapter</b> V, Book <b>I</b>); <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Westmarch added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> S.R. 1462.
<br>   The Shire at this time <b>had</b> hardly any “government”. Families for <b>the</b> most part managed their own affairs. Growing food <b>and</b> eating <b>it</b> occupied most <b>of</b> their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous <b>and</b> not greedy, <b>but</b> contented <b>and</b> moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, <b>and</b> small trades tended <b>to</b> remain unchanged for generations.
<br>   There remained, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> ancient tradition concerning <b>the</b> high king at Fornost, <b>or</b> Norbury as they called <b>it</b>, away north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But there <b>had</b> been <b>no</b> king for nearly a thousand years, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Kings” Norbury were covered with grass. Yet <b>the</b> Hobbits still said <b>of</b> wild folk <b>and</b> wicked things (such as trolls) that they <b>had</b> not heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king. For they attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> old all their essential laws; <b>and</b> usually they kept <b>the</b> laws <b>of</b> free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), both ancient <b>and</b> just.
<br>   It <b>is</b> true that <b>the</b> Took family <b>had</b> long been pre-eminent; for <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> Thain <b>had</b> passed <b>to</b> them (from <b>the</b> Oldbucks) some centuries before, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chief Took <b>had</b> borne that title ever since. The Thain <b>was</b> <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-moot, <b>and</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-muster <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbitry-<b>in</b>-arms, <b>but</b> as muster <b>and</b> moot were only held <b>in</b> times <b>of</b> emergency, which <b>no</b> longer occurred, <b>the</b> Thainship <b>had</b> ceased <b>to</b> be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family <b>was</b> still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for <b>it</b> remained both numerous <b>and</b> exceedingly wealthy, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> liable <b>to</b> produce <b>in</b> every generation strong characters <b>of</b> peculiar habits <b>and</b> even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> rich) than generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, <b>of</b> referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family as The Took, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> adding <b>to</b> his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim <b>the</b> Second, for instance.
<br>   The only real official <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire at this date <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Mayor <b>of</b> Michel Delving (<b>or</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire), who <b>was</b> elected every seven years at <b>the</b> Free Fair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> White Downs at <b>the</b> Lithe, that <b>is</b> at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty <b>was</b> <b>to</b> preside at banquets, given <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But <b>the</b> offices <b>of</b> Postmaster <b>and</b> First Shirriff were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mayoralty, so that he managed both <b>the</b> Messenger Service <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Watch. These were <b>the</b> only Shire-services, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Messengers were <b>the</b> most numerous, <b>and</b> much <b>the</b> busier <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two. By <b>no</b> means all Hobbits were lettered, <b>but</b> those who were wrote constantly <b>to</b> all their friends (<b>and</b> a selection <b>of</b> their relations) who lived further off than an afternoon's walk.
<br>   The Shirriffs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> name that <b>the</b> Hobbits gave <b>to</b> their police, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> nearest equivalent that they possessed. They <b>had</b>, <b>of</b> course, <b>no</b> uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather <b>in</b> their caps; <b>and</b> they were <b>in</b> practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with <b>the</b> strayings <b>of</b> beasts than <b>of</b> people. There were <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> Shire only twelve <b>of</b> them, three <b>in</b> each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying at need, <b>was</b> employed <b>to</b> “beat <b>the</b> bounds”, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> see that Outsiders <b>of</b> any kind, great <b>or</b> small, did not make themselves a nuisance.
<br>   At <b>the</b> time when this story begins <b>the</b> Bounders, as they were called, <b>had</b> been greatly increased. There were many reports <b>and</b> complaints <b>of</b> strange persons <b>and</b> creatures prowling about <b>the</b> borders, <b>or</b> over them: <b>the</b> first sign that all <b>was</b> not quite as <b>it</b> should be, <b>and</b> always <b>had</b> been except <b>in</b> tales <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> long ago. Few heeded <b>the</b> sign, <b>and</b> not even Bilbo yet <b>had</b> any notion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> portended. Sixty years <b>had</b> passed since he set out <b>on</b> his memorable journey, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred as often as not; <b>but</b> much evidently still remained <b>of</b> <b>the</b> considerable wealth that he <b>had</b> brought back. How much <b>or</b> how little he revealed <b>to</b> <b>no</b> one, not even <b>to</b> Frodo his favourite “nephew”. And he still kept secret <b>the</b> ring that he bad found.
<br>
<br>
<br>4. Of <b>the</b> Finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring
<br>   
<br>   As <b>is</b> told <b>in</b> The Hobbit, there came one day <b>to</b> Bilbo's door <b>the</b> great Wizard, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant <b>of</b> kings, <b>and</b> his twelve companions <b>in</b> exile. With them he set out, <b>to</b> his own lasting astonishment, <b>on</b> a morning <b>of</b> April, <b>it</b> being then <b>the</b> year 1341 Shire-reckoning, <b>on</b> a quest <b>of</b> great treasure, <b>the</b> dwarf-hoards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings under <b>the</b> Mountain, beneath Erebor <b>in</b> Dale, far off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East. The quest <b>was</b> successful, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dragon that guarded <b>the</b> hoard <b>was</b> destroyed. Yet, though before all <b>was</b> won <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies <b>was</b> fought, <b>and</b> Thorin <b>was</b> slain, <b>and</b> many deeds <b>of</b> renown were done, <b>the</b> matter would scarcely have concerned later history, <b>or</b> earned more than a note <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long annals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age, <b>but</b> for an “accident” <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way. The party <b>was</b> assailed <b>by</b> Orcs <b>in</b> a high pass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; <b>and</b> so <b>it</b> happened that Bilbo <b>was</b> lost for a while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black orc-mines deep under <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> there, as he groped <b>in</b> vain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, he put his hand <b>on</b> a ring, lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> a tunnel. He put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.
<br>   Trying <b>to</b> find his way out. Bilbo went <b>on</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, until he could go <b>no</b> further. At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel lay a cold lake far from <b>the</b> light, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> an island <b>of</b> rock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water lived Gollum. He <b>was</b> a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes <b>and</b> catching blind fish with his long fingers, <b>and</b> eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could catch <b>it</b> <b>and</b> strangle <b>it</b> <b>without</b> a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> him long ages ago, when he still lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light: a ring <b>of</b> gold that made its wearer invisible. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one thing he loved, his “precious”, <b>and</b> he talked <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, even when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not with him. For he kept <b>it</b> hidden safe <b>in</b> a hole <b>on</b> his island, except when he <b>was</b> hunting <b>or</b> spying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mines.
<br>   Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at <b>once</b>, if <b>the</b> ring <b>had</b> been <b>on</b> him when they met; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbit held <b>in</b> his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So <b>to</b> gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him <b>and</b> eat him; <b>but</b> if Bilbo defeated him, then he would <b>do</b> as Bilbo wished: he would lead him <b>to</b> a way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels.
<br>   Since he <b>was</b> lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>without</b> hope, <b>and</b> could neither go <b>on</b> nor back. Bilbo accepted <b>the</b> challenge; <b>and</b> they asked one another many riddles. In <b>the</b> end Bilbo won <b>the</b> game, more <b>by</b> luck (as <b>it</b> seemed) than <b>by</b> wits; for he <b>was</b> stumped at last for a riddle <b>to</b> ask, <b>and</b> cried out, as his hand came upon <b>the</b> ring he lad picked up <b>and</b> forgotten: What haw <b>I</b> got <b>in</b> my pocket? This Gollum failed <b>to</b> answer, though he demanded three guesses.
<br>   The Authorities, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true, differ whether this last question <b>was</b> a mere “question” <b>and</b> not a “riddle” according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strict rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Game; <b>but</b> all agree that, after accepting <b>it</b> <b>and</b> trying <b>to</b> guess <b>the</b> answer, Gollum <b>was</b> bound <b>by</b> his promise. And Bilbo pressed him <b>to</b> keep his word; for <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> came <b>to</b> him that this slimy creature might prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wickedest things feared <b>to</b> break them. But after ages alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark Gollum’s heart <b>was</b> black, <b>and</b> treachery <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b>. He slipped away, <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island, <b>of</b> which Bilbo knew <b>nothing</b>, not far off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark water. There, he <b>thought</b>, lay his ring. He <b>was</b> hungry now, <b>and</b> angry, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> his “precious” <b>was</b> with him he would not fear any weapon at all.
<br>   But <b>the</b> ring <b>was</b> not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island; he <b>had</b> lost <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> gone. His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened. But Gollum <b>had</b> at last leaped <b>to</b> a guess, too late. What has <b>it</b> got <b>in</b> its pocketses? he cried. The light <b>in</b> his eyes <b>was</b> like a green flame as he sped back <b>to</b> murder <b>the</b> hobbit <b>and</b> recover his “precious”. Just <b>in</b> time Bilbo saw his peril, <b>and</b> he fled blindly up <b>the</b> passage away from <b>the</b> water; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> more he <b>was</b> saved <b>by</b> his luck. For just as he ran he put his hand <b>in</b> his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring slipped quietly <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his finger. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Gollum passed him <b>without</b> seeing him, <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> guard <b>the</b> way out, lest <b>the</b> “thief” should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went along, cursing, <b>and</b> talking <b>to</b> himself about his “precious”; from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed <b>the</b> truth, <b>and</b> hope came <b>to</b> him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness: he himself <b>had</b> found <b>the</b> marvellous ring <b>and</b> a chance <b>of</b> escape from <b>the</b> orcs <b>and</b> from Gollum.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> a halt before an unseen opening that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mines, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling <b>and</b> listening; <b>and</b> Bilbo <b>was</b> tempted <b>to</b> slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, <b>and</b> though he kept <b>the</b> ring, <b>in</b> which his only hope lay, he would not <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> help him kill <b>the</b> wretched creature at a disadvantage. In <b>the</b> end, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> fled away down <b>the</b> passage, pursued <b>by</b> his enemy's cries <b>of</b> hate <b>and</b> despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates <b>it</b> for ever!
<br>   Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a curious fact that this <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> story as Bilbo first told <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his companions. To them his account <b>was</b> that Gollum <b>had</b> promised <b>to</b> give him a present, if he won <b>the</b> game; <b>but</b> when Gollum went <b>to</b> fetch <b>it</b> from his island he found <b>the</b> treasure <b>was</b> gone: a magic ring, which <b>had</b> been given <b>to</b> him long ago <b>on</b> his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> ring that he <b>had</b> found, <b>and</b> as he <b>had</b> won <b>the</b> game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already his <b>by</b> right. But being <b>in</b> a tight place, he said <b>nothing</b> about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> made Gollum show him <b>the</b> way out, as a reward instead <b>of</b> a present. This account Bilbo set down <b>in</b> his memoirs, <b>and</b> he seems never <b>to</b> have altered <b>it</b> himself, not even after <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Elrond. Evidently <b>it</b> still appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original Red Book, as <b>it</b> did <b>in</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> copies <b>and</b> abstracts. But many copies contain <b>the</b> true account (as an alternative), derived <b>no</b> doubt from notes <b>by</b> Frodo <b>or</b> Samwise, both <b>of</b> whom learned <b>the</b> truth, though they seem <b>to</b> have been unwilling <b>to</b> delete anything actually written <b>by</b> <b>the</b> old hobbit himself.
<br>   Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> he continued <b>to</b> be <b>very</b> curious about <b>the</b> ring. Eventually he got <b>the</b> true tale out <b>of</b> Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wizard seemed <b>to</b> think <b>the</b> truth important. Though he did not say so <b>to</b> Bilbo, he also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> important, <b>and</b> disturbing, <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> good hobbit <b>had</b> not told <b>the</b> truth from <b>the</b> first: quite contrary <b>to</b> his habit. The idea <b>of</b> a “present” <b>was</b> not mere hobbitlike invention, all <b>the</b> same. It <b>was</b> suggested <b>to</b> Bilbo, as he confessed, <b>by</b> Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, <b>in</b> fact, call <b>the</b> ring his “birthday present”, many times. That also Gandalf <b>thought</b> strange <b>and</b> suspicious; <b>but</b> he did not discover <b>the</b> truth <b>in</b> this point for many more years, as will be seen <b>in</b> this <b>book</b>.
<br>   Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring he escaped from <b>the</b> orc-guards at <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> rejoined his companions. He used <b>the</b> ring many times <b>on</b> his quest, chiefly for <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> his friends; <b>but</b> he kept <b>it</b> secret from them as long as he could. After his return <b>to</b> his home he never spoke <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again <b>to</b> anyone, save Gandalf <b>and</b> Frodo; <b>and</b> <b>no</b> one else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire knew <b>of</b> its existence, <b>or</b> so he believed. Only <b>to</b> Frodo did he show <b>the</b> account <b>of</b> his Journey that he <b>was</b> writing.
<br>   His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, <b>and</b> his coat <b>of</b> marvellous mail, <b>the</b> gift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves from <b>the</b> Dragon-hoard, he lent <b>to</b> a museum, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Michel Delving Mathom-house <b>in</b> fact. But he kept <b>in</b> a drawer at Bag End <b>the</b> old cloak <b>and</b> hood that he <b>had</b> worn <b>on</b> his travels; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring, secured <b>by</b> a fine chain, remained <b>in</b> his pocket.
<br>   He returned <b>to</b> his home at Bag End <b>on</b> June <b>the</b> 22nd <b>in</b> his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>very</b> notable occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire until Mr. Baggins began <b>the</b> preparations for <b>the</b> celebration <b>of</b> his hundred-<b>and</b>-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401). At this point this History begins.
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age <b>the</b> part played <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great events that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest <b>in</b> their own history; <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their traditions, up <b>to</b> that time still mainly oral, were collected <b>and</b> Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom at large, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their members studied its ancient histories <b>and</b> legends. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first century <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourth Age there were already <b>to</b> be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire several libraries that contained many historical books <b>and</b> records.
<br>   The largest <b>of</b> these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, <b>and</b> at Brandy Hall. This account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age <b>is</b> drawn mainly from <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> Westmarch. That most important source for <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> so called because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long preserved at Undertowers, <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fairbairns, Wardens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Westmarch.3 It <b>was</b> <b>in</b> origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him <b>to</b> Rivendell. Frodo brought <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire, together with many loose leaves <b>of</b> notes, <b>and</b> during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War. But annexed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> preserved with <b>it</b>, probably m a single red case, were <b>the</b> three large volumes, bound <b>in</b> red leather, that Bilbo gave <b>to</b> him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there <b>was</b> added <b>in</b> Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, <b>and</b> various other matter concerning <b>the</b> hobbit members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fellowship.
<br>   The original Red Book has not been preserved, <b>but</b> many copies were made, especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first volume, for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a different history. It <b>was</b> kept at Great Smials, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written <b>in</b> Condor, probably at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great-grandson <b>of</b> Peregrin, <b>and</b> completed <b>in</b> S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King's Writer, finished this work <b>in</b> IV 172. It <b>is</b> an exact copy <b>in</b> all details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Thain's Book m Minas Tirith. That <b>book</b> <b>was</b> a copy, made at <b>the</b> request <b>of</b> King Elessar, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Periannath, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> brought <b>to</b> him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Thain Peregrin when he retired <b>to</b> Gondor <b>in</b> IV 64.
<br>   The Thain's Book <b>was</b> thus <b>the</b> first copy made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Book <b>and</b> contained much that <b>was</b> later omitted <b>or</b> lost. In Minas Tirith <b>it</b> received much annotation, <b>and</b> many corrections, especially <b>of</b> names, words, <b>and</b> quotations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elvish languages; <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> added <b>to</b> <b>it</b> an abbreviated version <b>of</b> those parts <b>of</b> The Tale <b>of</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> Arwen which lie outside <b>the</b> account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War. The full tale <b>is</b> stated <b>to</b> have been written <b>by</b> Barahir, grandson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steward Faramir, some time after <b>the</b> passing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King. But <b>the</b> chief importance <b>of</b> Findegil's copy <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> alone contains <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Bilbo's “Translations from <b>the</b> Elvish”. These three volumes were found <b>to</b> be a work <b>of</b> great skill <b>and</b> learning <b>in</b> which, between 1403 <b>and</b> 1418, he <b>had</b> used all <b>the</b> sources available <b>to</b> him <b>in</b> Rivendell, both living <b>and</b> written. But since they were little used <b>by</b> Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>no</b> more <b>is</b> said <b>of</b> them here.
<br>   Since Meriadoc <b>and</b> Peregrin became <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> their great families, <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> same time kept up their connexions with Rohan <b>and</b> Gondor, <b>the</b> libraries at Bucklebury <b>and</b> Tuckborough contained much that did not appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador <b>and</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Rohan. Some <b>of</b> these were composed <b>or</b> begun <b>by</b> Meriadoc himself, though <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire he <b>was</b> chiefly remembered for his Herblore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> for his Reckoning <b>of</b> Years m which he discussed <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calendars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree <b>to</b> those <b>of</b> Rivendell, Gondor, <b>and</b> Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise <b>on</b> Old Words <b>and</b> Names <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>having</b> special interest <b>in</b> discovering <b>the</b> kinship with <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rohirrim <b>of</b> such “shire-words” as mathom <b>and</b> old elements <b>in</b> place names.
<br>   At Great Smials <b>the</b> books were <b>of</b> less interest <b>to</b> Shire-folk, though more important for larger history. None <b>of</b> them <b>was</b> written <b>by</b> Peregrin, <b>but</b> he <b>and</b> his successors collected many manuscripts written <b>by</b> scribes <b>of</b> Gondor: mainly copies <b>or</b> summaries <b>of</b> histories <b>or</b> legends relating <b>to</b> Elendil <b>and</b> his heirs. Only here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire were <b>to</b> be found extensive materials for <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> N?menor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arising <b>of</b> Sauron. It <b>was</b> probably at Great Smials that The Tale <b>of</b> Years4 <b>was</b> put together, with <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> material collected <b>by</b> Meriadoc. Though <b>the</b> dates given are often conjectural, especially for <b>the</b> Second Age, they deserve attention. It <b>is</b> probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance <b>and</b> information from Rivendell, which he visited more than <b>once</b>. There, though Elrond <b>had</b> departed, his sons long remained, together with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High-elven folk. It <b>is</b> said that Celeborn went <b>to</b> dwell there after <b>the</b> departure <b>of</b> Galadriel; <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day when at last he sought <b>the</b> Grey Havens, <b>and</b> with him went <b>the</b> last living memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days <b>in</b> Middle-earth.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 1
<br>A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY
<br>   
<br>   When Mr. Bilbo Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party <b>of</b> special magnificence, there <b>was</b> much talk <b>and</b> excitement <b>in</b> Hobbiton.
<br>   Bilbo <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rich <b>and</b> <b>very</b> peculiar, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> been <b>the</b> wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance <b>and</b> unexpected return. The riches he <b>had</b> brought back from his travels <b>had</b> now become a local legend, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> popularly believed, whatever <b>the</b> old folk might say, that <b>the</b> Hill at Bag End <b>was</b> full <b>of</b> tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that <b>was</b> not enough for fame, there <b>was</b> also his prolonged vigour <b>to</b> marvel at. Time wore <b>on</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have little effect <b>on</b> Mr. Baggins. At ninety he <b>was</b> much <b>the</b> same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began <b>to</b> call him well-preserved, <b>but</b> unchanged would have been nearer <b>the</b> mark. There were some that shook their heads <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> this <b>was</b> too much <b>of</b> a good thing; <b>it</b> seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
<br>   “It will have <b>to</b> be paid for,” they said. “It isn’t natural, <b>and</b> trouble will come <b>of</b> <b>it</b>!”
<br>   But so far trouble <b>had</b> not come; <b>and</b> as Mr. Baggins <b>was</b> generous with his money, most people were willing <b>to</b> forgive him his oddities <b>and</b> his good fortune. He remained <b>on</b> visiting terms with his relatives (except, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses), <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> many devoted admirers among <b>the</b> hobbits <b>of</b> poor <b>and</b> unimportant families. But he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> close friends, until some <b>of</b> his younger cousins began <b>to</b> grow up.
<br>   The eldest <b>of</b> these, <b>and</b> Bilbo’s favourite, <b>was</b> young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo <b>was</b> ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, <b>and</b> brought him <b>to</b> live at Bag End; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo happened <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> same birthday, September 22nd. “You <b>had</b> better come <b>and</b> live here, Frodo my lad,” said Bilbo one day; “<b>and</b> then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.” At that time Frodo <b>was</b> still <b>in</b> his tweens, as <b>the</b> hobbits called <b>the</b> irresponsible twenties between childhood <b>and</b> coming <b>of</b> age at thirty-three.
<br>   Twelve more years passed. Each year <b>the</b> Bagginses <b>had</b> given <b>very</b> lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; <b>but</b> now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> understood that something quite exceptional <b>was</b> being planned for that autumn. Bilbo <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number <b>and</b> a <b>very</b> respectable age for a hobbit (<b>the</b> Old Took himself <b>had</b> only reached 130); <b>and</b> Frodo <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> be thirty-three, 33) an important number: <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> his “coming <b>of</b> age”.
<br>   Tongues began <b>to</b> wag <b>in</b> Hobbiton <b>and</b> Bywater; <b>and</b> rumour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coming event travelled all over <b>the</b> Shire. The history <b>and</b> character <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo Baggins became <b>once</b> again <b>the</b> chief topic <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b>; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> older folk suddenly found their reminiscences <b>in</b> welcome demand.
<br>   No one <b>had</b> a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as <b>the</b> Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bywater road; <b>and</b> he spoke with some authority, for he <b>had</b> tended <b>the</b> garden at Bag End for forty years, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> helped old Holman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same job before that. Now that he <b>was</b> himself growing old <b>and</b> stiff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> joints, <b>the</b> job <b>was</b> mainly carried <b>on</b> <b>by</b> his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father <b>and</b> son were <b>on</b> <b>very</b> friendly terms with Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo. They lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hill itself, <b>in</b> Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.
<br>   “A <b>very</b> nice well-spoken gentlehobbit <b>is</b> Mr. Bilbo, as <b>I</b>’ve always said,” <b>the</b> Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo <b>was</b> <b>very</b> polite <b>to</b> him, calling him “Master Hamfast”, <b>and</b> consulting him constantly upon <b>the</b> growing <b>of</b> vegetables—<b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> “roots”, especially potatoes, <b>the</b> Gaffer <b>was</b> recognized as <b>the</b> leading authority <b>by</b> all <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood (including himself).
<br>   “But <b>what</b> about this Frodo that lives with him?” asked Old Noakes <b>of</b> Bywater. “Baggins <b>is</b> his name, <b>but</b> he’s more than half a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins <b>of</b> Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there <b>in</b> Buckland, where folks are so queer.”
<br>   “And <b>no</b> wonder they’re queer,” put <b>in</b> Daddy Twofoot (<b>the</b> Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), “if they live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River, <b>and</b> right agin <b>the</b> Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half <b>the</b> tales be true.”
<br>   “You’re right, Dad!” said <b>the</b> Gaffer. “Not that <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>of</b> Buck-land live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest; <b>but</b> they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats <b>on</b> that big river—<b>and</b> that isn’t natural. Small wonder that trouble came <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> say. But be that as <b>it</b> may, Mr. Frodo <b>is</b> as nice a young hobbit as you could wish <b>to</b> meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> more than looks. After all his father <b>was</b> a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit <b>was</b> Mr. Drogo Baggins; there <b>was</b> never much <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> him, till he <b>was</b> drownded.”
<br>   “Drownded?” said several voices. They <b>had</b> heard this <b>and</b> other darker rumours before, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> hobbits have a passion for family history, <b>and</b> they were ready <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b> again. “Well, so they say,” said <b>the</b> Gaffer. “You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She <b>was</b> our Mr. Bilbo’s first cousin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mother’s side (<b>her</b> mother being <b>the</b> youngest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Took’s daughters); <b>and</b> Mr. Drogo <b>was</b> his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo <b>is</b> his first <b>and</b> second cousin, <b>once</b> removed either way, as <b>the</b> saying <b>is</b>, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo <b>was</b> staying at Brandy Hall with his father-<b>in</b>-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial <b>to</b> his vittles, <b>and</b> old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); <b>and</b> he went out boating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River; <b>and</b> he <b>and</b> his wife were drownded, <b>and</b> poor Mr. Frodo only a child <b>and</b> all.”
<br>   “<b>I</b>’ve heard they went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water after dinner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight,” said Old Noakes; “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Drogo’s weight as sunk <b>the</b> boat.”
<br>   “And <b>I</b> heard <b>she</b> pushed him <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> he pulled <b>her</b> <b>in</b> after him,” said Sandyman, <b>the</b> Hobbiton miller.
<br>   “You shouldn’t listen <b>to</b> all you hear, Sandyman,” said <b>the</b> Gaffer, who did not much like <b>the</b> miller. “There isn’t <b>no</b> call <b>to</b> go talking <b>of</b> pushing <b>and</b> pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still <b>without</b> looking further for <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> trouble. Anyway: there <b>was</b> this Mr. Frodo left an orphan <b>and</b> stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow <b>in</b> Brandy Hall. A regular warren, <b>by</b> all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never <b>had</b> fewer than a couple <b>of</b> hundred relations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought <b>the</b> lad back <b>to</b> live among decent folk.
<br>   “But <b>I</b> reckon <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They <b>thought</b> they were going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Bag End, that time when he went off <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be dead. And then he comes back <b>and</b> orders them off; <b>and</b> he goes <b>on</b> living <b>and</b> living, <b>and</b> never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, <b>and</b> has all <b>the</b> papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never see <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> Bag End now, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be hoped not.”
<br>   “There’s a tidy bit <b>of</b> money tucked away up there, <b>I</b> hear tell,” said a stranger, a visitor <b>on</b> business from Michel Delving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Westfarthing. “All <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> your hill <b>is</b> full <b>of</b> tunnels packed with chests <b>of</b> gold <b>and</b> silver, <b>and</b> jools, <b>by</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b>’ve heard.”
<br>   “Then you’ve heard more than <b>I</b> can speak <b>to</b>,” answered <b>the</b> Gaffer. <b>I</b> know <b>nothing</b> about jools. Mr. Bilbo <b>is</b> free with his money, <b>and</b> there seems <b>no</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> know <b>of</b> <b>no</b> tunnel-making. <b>I</b> saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter <b>of</b> sixty years ago, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a lad. <b>I</b>’d not long come prentice <b>to</b> old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin), <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> me up at Bag End helping him <b>to</b> keep folks from trampling <b>and</b> trapessing all over <b>the</b> garden while <b>the</b> sale <b>was</b> <b>on</b>. And <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all Mr. Bilbo comes up <b>the</b> Hill with a pony <b>and</b> some mighty big bags <b>and</b> a couple <b>of</b> chests. <b>I</b> don’t doubt they were mostly full <b>of</b> treasure he <b>had</b> picked up <b>in</b> foreign parts, where there be mountains <b>of</b> gold, they say; <b>but</b> there wasn’t enough <b>to</b> fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He’s <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> Bag End. Crazy about stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old days he <b>is</b>, <b>and</b> he listens <b>to</b> all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters—meaning <b>no</b> harm, mark you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope <b>no</b> harm will come <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Elves <b>and</b> Dragons” <b>I</b> says <b>to</b> him. “Cabbages <b>and</b> potatoes are better for me <b>and</b> you. Don’t go getting mixed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business <b>of</b> your betters, <b>or</b> you’ll land <b>in</b> trouble too big for you,” <b>I</b> says <b>to</b> him. And <b>I</b> might say <b>it</b> <b>to</b> others,” he added with a look at <b>the</b> stranger <b>and</b> <b>the</b> miller.
<br>   But <b>the</b> Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend <b>of</b> Bilbo’s wealth <b>was</b> now too firmly fixed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> younger generation <b>of</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Ah, <b>but</b> he has likely enough been adding <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he brought at first,” argued <b>the</b> miller, voicing common opinion. “He’s often away from home. And look at <b>the</b> outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, <b>and</b> that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, <b>and</b> all. You can say <b>what</b> you like, Gaffer, <b>but</b> Bag End’s a queer place, <b>and</b> its folk are queerer.”
<br>   “And you can say <b>what</b> you like, about <b>what</b> you know <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> than you <b>do</b> <b>of</b> boating, Mr. Sandyman,” retorted <b>the</b> Gaffer, disliking <b>the</b> miller even more than usual. If that’s being queer, then we could <b>do</b> with a bit more queerness <b>in</b> these parts. There’s some not far away that wouldn’t offer a pint <b>of</b> beer <b>to</b> a friend, if they lived <b>in</b> a hole with golden walls. But they <b>do</b> things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone’s going <b>to</b> be invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> party, <b>and</b> there’s going <b>to</b> be presents, mark you, presents for all—this <b>very</b> month as <b>is</b>.”
<br>   That <b>very</b> month <b>was</b> September, <b>and</b> as fine as you could ask. A day <b>or</b> two later a rumour (probably started <b>by</b> <b>the</b> knowledgeable Sam) <b>was</b> spread about that there were going <b>to</b> be fireworks—fireworks, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> more, such as <b>had</b> not been seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire for nigh <b>on</b> a century, not indeed since <b>the</b> Old Took died.
<br>   Days passed <b>and</b> The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled <b>into</b> Hobbiton one evening <b>and</b> toiled up <b>the</b> Hill <b>to</b> Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out <b>of</b> lamplit doors <b>to</b> gape at <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> driven <b>by</b> outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards <b>and</b> deep hoods. A few <b>of</b> them remained at Bag End. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second week <b>in</b> September a cart came <b>in</b> through Bywater from <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge <b>in</b> broad daylight. An old man <b>was</b> driving <b>it</b> all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, <b>and</b> a silver scarf. He <b>had</b> a long white beard <b>and</b> bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond <b>the</b> brim <b>of</b> his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after <b>the</b> cart all through Hobbiton <b>and</b> right up <b>the</b> hill. It <b>had</b> a cargo <b>of</b> fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door <b>the</b> old man began <b>to</b> unload: there were great bundles <b>of</b> fireworks <b>of</b> all sorts <b>and</b> shapes, each labelled with a large red G  <b>and</b> <b>the</b> elf-rune, .
<br>   That <b>was</b> Gandalf’s mark, <b>of</b> course, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old man <b>was</b> Gandalf <b>the</b> Wizard, whose fame <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>was</b> due mainly <b>to</b> his skill with fires, smokes, <b>and</b> lights. His real business <b>was</b> far more difficult <b>and</b> dangerous, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk knew <b>nothing</b> about <b>it</b>. To them he <b>was</b> just one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “attractions” at <b>the</b> Party. Hence <b>the</b> excitement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbit-children. “G for Grand!” they shouted, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old man smiled. They knew him <b>by</b> sight, though he only appeared <b>in</b> Hobbiton occasionally <b>and</b> never stopped long; <b>but</b> neither they nor any <b>but</b> <b>the</b> oldest <b>of</b> their elders <b>had</b> seen one <b>of</b> his firework displays—they now belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legendary past.
<br>   When <b>the</b> old man, helped <b>by</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> some dwarves, <b>had</b> finished unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; <b>but</b> not a single squib <b>or</b> cracker <b>was</b> forthcoming, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disappointment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onlookers.
<br>   “Run away now!” said Gandalf. “You will <b>get</b> plenty when <b>the</b> time comes.” Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door <b>was</b> shut. The young hobbits stared at <b>the</b> door <b>in</b> vain for a while, <b>and</b> then made off, feeling that <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party would never come.
<br>   Inside Bag End, Bilbo <b>and</b> Gandalf were <b>sitting</b> at <b>the</b> open window <b>of</b> a small room looking out west <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden. The late afternoon <b>was</b> bright <b>and</b> peaceful. The flowers glowed red <b>and</b> golden: snap-dragons <b>and</b> sun-flowers, <b>and</b> nasturtiums trailing all over <b>the</b> turf walls <b>and</b> peeping <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> round windows.
<br>   “How bright your garden looks!” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Yes,” said Bilbo. <b>I</b> am <b>very</b> fond indeed <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> dear old Shire; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> need a holiday.”
<br>   “You mean <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> with your plan then?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>. <b>I</b> made up my mind months ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven’t changed <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Very well. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good saying any more. Stick <b>to</b> your plan—your whole plan, mind—<b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope <b>it</b> will turn out for <b>the</b> best, for you, <b>and</b> for all <b>of</b> us.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope so. Anyway <b>I</b> mean <b>to</b> enjoy myself <b>on</b> Thursday, <b>and</b> have my little joke.”
<br>   “Who will laugh, <b>I</b> wonder?” said Gandalf, shaking his head.
<br>   “We shall see,” said Bilbo.
<br>   The next day more carts rolled up <b>the</b> Hill, <b>and</b> still more carts. There might have been some grumbling about “dealing locally”, <b>but</b> that <b>very</b> week orders began <b>to</b> pour out <b>of</b> Bag End for every kind <b>of</b> provision, commodity, <b>or</b> luxury that could be obtained <b>in</b> Hobbiton <b>or</b> Bywater <b>or</b> anywhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; <b>and</b> they began <b>to</b> tick off <b>the</b> days <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calendar; <b>and</b> they watched eagerly for <b>the</b> postman, hoping for invitations.
<br>   Before long <b>the</b> invitations began pouring out, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hobbiton post-office <b>was</b> blocked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bywater post-office <b>was</b> snowed under, <b>and</b> voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There <b>was</b> a constant stream <b>of</b> them going up <b>the</b> Hill, carrying hundreds <b>of</b> polite variations <b>on</b> Thank you, <b>I</b> shall certainly come.
<br>   A notice appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gate at Bag End: <b>no</b> admittance except <b>on</b> party business. Even those who <b>had</b>, <b>or</b> pretended <b>to</b> have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo <b>was</b> busy: writing invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, <b>and</b> making some private preparations <b>of</b> his own. From <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> Gandalf’s arrival he remained hidden from view.
<br>   One morning <b>the</b> hobbits woke <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> large field, south <b>of</b> Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes <b>and</b> poles for tents <b>and</b> pavilions. A special entrance <b>was</b> cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> wide steps <b>and</b> a large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families <b>of</b> Bagshot Row, adjoining <b>the</b> field, were intensely interested <b>and</b> generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending <b>to</b> work <b>in</b> his garden.
<br>   The tents began <b>to</b> go up. There <b>was</b> a specially large pavilion, so big that <b>the</b> tree that grew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field <b>was</b> right inside <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> stood proudly near one end, at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief table. Lanterns were hung <b>on</b> all its branches. More promising still (<b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits” mind): an enormous open-air kitchen <b>was</b> erected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. A draught <b>of</b> cooks, from every inn <b>and</b> eating-house for miles around, arrived <b>to</b> supplement <b>the</b> dwarves <b>and</b> other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose <b>to</b> its height.
<br>   Then <b>the</b> weather clouded over. That <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Party. Anxiety <b>was</b> intense. Then Thursday, September <b>the</b> 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, <b>the</b> clouds vanished, flags were unfurled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fun began.
<br>   Bilbo Baggins called <b>it</b> a party, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really a variety <b>of</b> entertainments rolled <b>into</b> one. Practically everybody living near <b>was</b> invited. A <b>very</b> few were overlooked <b>by</b> accident, <b>but</b> as they turned up all <b>the</b> same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were also asked; <b>and</b> there were even a few from outside <b>the</b> borders. Bilbo met <b>the</b> guests (<b>and</b> additions) at <b>the</b> new white gate <b>in</b> person. He gave away presents <b>to</b> all <b>and</b> sundry—<b>the</b> latter were those who went out again <b>by</b> a back way <b>and</b> came <b>in</b> again <b>by</b> <b>the</b> gate. Hobbits give presents <b>to</b> other people <b>on</b> their own birthdays. Not <b>very</b> expensive ones, as a rule, <b>and</b> not so lavishly as <b>on</b> this occasion; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a bad system. Actually <b>in</b> Hobbiton <b>and</b> Bywater every day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year <b>it</b> <b>was</b> somebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit <b>in</b> those parts <b>had</b> a fair chance <b>of</b> at least one present at least <b>once</b> a week. But they never got <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> them.
<br>   On this occasion <b>the</b> presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> which they <b>had</b> never seen before, all beautiful <b>and</b> some obviously magical. Many <b>of</b> them <b>had</b> indeed been ordered a year before, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> come all <b>the</b> way from <b>the</b> Mountain <b>and</b> from Dale, <b>and</b> were <b>of</b> real dwarf-make.
<br>   When every guest <b>had</b> been welcomed <b>and</b> <b>was</b> finally inside <b>the</b> gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, <b>and</b>, <b>of</b> course, food <b>and</b> drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, <b>and</b> dinner (<b>or</b> supper). But lunch <b>and</b> tea were marked chiefly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that at those times all <b>the</b> guests were <b>sitting</b> down <b>and</b> eating together. At other times there were merely lots <b>of</b> people eating <b>and</b> drinking—continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when <b>the</b> fireworks started.
<br>   The fireworks were <b>by</b> Gandalf: they were not only brought <b>by</b> him, <b>but</b> designed <b>and</b> made <b>by</b> him; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> special effects, set pieces, <b>and</b> flights <b>of</b> rockets were let off <b>by</b> him. But there <b>was</b> also a generous distribution <b>of</b> squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers <b>and</b> thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art <b>of</b> Gandalf improved with age.
<br>   There were rockets like a flight <b>of</b> scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks <b>of</b> dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding <b>in</b> a moment, <b>and</b> their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon <b>the</b> astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains <b>of</b> butterflies that flew glittering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees; there were pillars <b>of</b> coloured fires that rose <b>and</b> turned <b>into</b> eagles, <b>or</b> sailing ships, <b>or</b> a phalanx <b>of</b> flying swans; there <b>was</b> a red thunderstorm <b>and</b> a shower <b>of</b> yellow rain; there <b>was</b> a forest <b>of</b> silver spears that sprang suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air with a yell like an embattled army, <b>and</b> came down again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there <b>was</b> also one last surprise, <b>in</b> honour <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> startled <b>the</b> hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> glow at <b>the</b> summit. It spouted green <b>and</b> scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon—not life-size, <b>but</b> terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there <b>was</b> a roar, <b>and</b> he whizzed three times over <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd. They all ducked, <b>and</b> many fell flat <b>on</b> their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, <b>and</b> burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> signal for supper!” said Bilbo. The pain <b>and</b> alarm vanished at <b>once</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> prostrate hobbits leaped <b>to</b> their feet. There <b>was</b> a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that <b>is</b>, except those invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special family dinner-party. This <b>was</b> held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great pavilion with <b>the</b> tree. The invitations were limited <b>to</b> twelve dozen (a number also called <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hobbits one Gross, though <b>the</b> word <b>was</b> not considered proper <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> people); <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guests were selected from all <b>the</b> families <b>to</b> which Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo were related, with <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, <b>and</b> present <b>by</b> parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> up late, especially when there <b>was</b> a chance <b>of</b> getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot <b>of</b> provender.
<br>   There were many Bagginses <b>and</b> Boffins, <b>and</b> also many Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations <b>of</b> Bilbo Baggins” grandmother), <b>and</b> various Chubbs (connexions <b>of</b> his Took grandfather); <b>and</b> a selection <b>of</b> Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers <b>and</b> Proudfoots. Some <b>of</b> these were only <b>very</b> distantly connected with Bilbo, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them <b>had</b> hardly ever been <b>in</b> Hobbiton before, as they lived <b>in</b> remote corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho <b>and</b> his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo <b>and</b> detested Frodo, <b>but</b> so magnificent <b>was</b> <b>the</b> invitation card, written <b>in</b> golden ink, that they <b>had</b> felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible <b>to</b> refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, <b>had</b> been specializing <b>in</b> food for many years <b>and</b> his table <b>had</b> a high reputation.
<br>   All <b>the</b> one hundred <b>and</b> forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded <b>the</b> after-dinner speech <b>of</b> their host (an inevitable item). He <b>was</b> liable <b>to</b> drag <b>in</b> bits <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he called poetry; <b>and</b> sometimes, after a glass <b>or</b> two, would allude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absurd adventures <b>of</b> his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they <b>had</b> a <b>very</b> pleasant feast, <b>in</b> fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, <b>and</b> prolonged. The purchase <b>of</b> provisions fell almost <b>to</b> <b>nothing</b> throughout <b>the</b> district <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing weeks; <b>but</b> as Bilbo’s catering <b>had</b> depleted <b>the</b> stocks <b>of</b> most stores, cellars <b>and</b> warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.
<br>   After <b>the</b> feast (more <b>or</b> less) came <b>the</b> Speech. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company were, however, now <b>in</b> a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called “filling up <b>the</b> corners”. They were sipping their favourite drinks, <b>and</b> nibbling at their favourite dainties, <b>and</b> their fears were forgotten. They were prepared <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> anything, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> cheer at every full stop.
<br>   My dear People, began Bilbo, rising <b>in</b> his place. “Hear! Hear! Hear!” they shouted, <b>and</b> kept <b>on</b> repeating <b>it</b> <b>in</b> chorus, seeming reluctant <b>to</b> follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place <b>and</b> went <b>and</b> stood <b>on</b> a chair under <b>the</b> illuminated tree. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lanterns fell <b>on</b> his beaming face; <b>the</b> golden buttons shone <b>on</b> his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his trouser-pocket.
<br>   My dear Bagginses <b>and</b> Boffins, he began again; <b>and</b> my dear Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks, <b>and</b> Grubbs, <b>and</b> Chubbs, <b>and</b> Burrowses, <b>and</b> Hornblowers, <b>and</b> Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses <b>and</b> Proudfoots. “ProudFEET!” shouted an elderly hobbit from <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion. His name, <b>of</b> course, <b>was</b> Proudfoot, <b>and</b> well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, <b>and</b> both were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table.
<br>   Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that <b>I</b> welcome back at last <b>to</b> Bag End. Today <b>is</b> my one hundred <b>and</b> eleventh birthday: <b>I</b> am eleventy-one today! “Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!” they shouted, <b>and</b> they hammered joyously <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tables. Bilbo <b>was</b> doing splendidly. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> stuff they liked: short <b>and</b> obvious.
<br>   <b>I</b> hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as <b>I</b> am. Deafening cheers. Cries <b>of</b> Yes (<b>and</b> No). Noises <b>of</b> trumpets <b>and</b> horns, pipes <b>and</b> flutes, <b>and</b> other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. Hundreds <b>of</b> musical crackers <b>had</b> been pulled. Most <b>of</b> them bore <b>the</b> mark dale <b>on</b> them; which did not convey much <b>to</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>but</b> they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> perfect make <b>and</b> enchanting tones. Indeed, <b>in</b> one corner some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young Tooks <b>and</b> Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo <b>to</b> have finished (since he <b>had</b> plainly said all that <b>was</b> necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, <b>and</b> began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took <b>and</b> Miss Melilot Brandybuck got <b>on</b> a table <b>and</b> with bells <b>in</b> their hands began <b>to</b> dance <b>the</b> Springle-ring: a pretty dance, <b>but</b> rather vigorous.
<br>   But Bilbo <b>had</b> not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near <b>by</b>, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. <b>I</b> shall not keep you long, he cried. Cheers from all <b>the</b> assembly. <b>I</b> have called you all together for a Purpose. Something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way that he said this made an impression. There <b>was</b> almost silence, <b>and</b> one <b>or</b> two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tooks pricked up their ears.
<br>   Indeed, for Three Purposes! First <b>of</b> all, <b>to</b> tell you that <b>I</b> am immensely fond <b>of</b> you all, <b>and</b> that eleventy-one years <b>is</b> too short a time <b>to</b> live among such excellent <b>and</b> admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst <b>of</b> approval.
<br>   <b>I</b> don’t know half <b>of</b> you half as well as <b>I</b> should like; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> like less than half <b>of</b> you half as well as you deserve. This <b>was</b> unexpected <b>and</b> rather difficult. There <b>was</b> some scattered clapping, <b>but</b> most <b>of</b> them were trying <b>to</b> work <b>it</b> out <b>and</b> see if <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> a compliment.
<br>   Secondly, <b>to</b> celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. <b>I</b> should say: OUR birthday. For <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, <b>of</b> course, also <b>the</b> birthday <b>of</b> my heir <b>and</b> nephew, Frodo. He comes <b>of</b> age <b>and</b> <b>into</b> his inheritance today. Some perfunctory clapping <b>by</b> <b>the</b> elders; <b>and</b> some loud shouts <b>of</b> “Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,” from <b>the</b> juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, <b>and</b> wondered <b>what</b> <b>was</b> meant <b>by</b> “coming <b>into</b> his inheritance”. Together we score one hundred <b>and</b> forty-four. Your numbers were chosen <b>to</b> fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if <b>I</b> may <b>use</b> <b>the</b> expression. No cheers. This <b>was</b> ridiculous. Many <b>of</b> his guests, <b>and</b> especially <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they <b>had</b> only been asked <b>to</b> fill up <b>the</b> required number, like goods <b>in</b> a package. “One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.”
<br>   It <b>is</b> also, if <b>I</b> may be allowed <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> ancient history, <b>the</b> anniversary <b>of</b> my arrival <b>by</b> barrel at Esgaroth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Long Lake; though <b>the</b> fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my birthday slipped my memory <b>on</b> that occasion. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only fifty-one then, <b>and</b> birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet <b>was</b> <b>very</b> splendid, however, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a bad cold at <b>the</b> time, <b>I</b> remember, <b>and</b> could only say “thag you <b>very</b> buch”. <b>I</b> now repeat <b>it</b> more correctly: Thank you <b>very</b> much for coming <b>to</b> my little party. Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song <b>or</b> some poetry <b>was</b> now imminent; <b>and</b> they were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop talking <b>and</b> let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing <b>or</b> recite. He paused for a moment.
<br>   Thirdly <b>and</b> finally, he said, <b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He spoke this last word so loudly <b>and</b> suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. <b>I</b> regret <b>to</b> announce that—though, as <b>I</b> said, eleventy-one years <b>is</b> far too short a time <b>to</b> spend among you—this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> END. <b>I</b> am going. <b>I</b> am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!
<br>   He stepped down <b>and</b> vanished. There <b>was</b> a blinding flash <b>of</b> light, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo <b>was</b> nowhere <b>to</b> be seen. One hundred <b>and</b> forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from <b>the</b> table <b>and</b> stamped. Then there <b>was</b> a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, <b>and</b> Proudfoot began <b>to</b> talk at <b>once</b>.
<br>   It <b>was</b> generally agreed that <b>the</b> joke <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>very</b> bad taste, <b>and</b> more food <b>and</b> drink were needed <b>to</b> cure <b>the</b> guests <b>of</b> shock <b>and</b> annoyance. “He’s mad. <b>I</b> always said so,” <b>was</b> probably <b>the</b> most popular comment. Even <b>the</b> Tooks (with a few exceptions) <b>thought</b> Bilbo’s behaviour <b>was</b> absurd. For <b>the</b> moment most <b>of</b> them took <b>it</b> for granted that his disappearance <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a ridiculous prank.
<br>   But old Rory Brandybuck <b>was</b> not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner <b>had</b> clouded his wits, <b>and</b> he said <b>to</b> his daughter-<b>in</b>-law, Esmeralda: “There’s something fishy <b>in</b> this, my dear! <b>I</b> believe that mad Baggins <b>is</b> off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn’t taken <b>the</b> vittles with him.” He called loudly <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> wine round again.
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only one present who <b>had</b> said <b>nothing</b>. For some time he <b>had</b> sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, <b>and</b> ignored all remarks <b>and</b> questions. He <b>had</b> enjoyed <b>the</b> joke, <b>of</b> course, even though he <b>had</b> been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> know. He <b>had</b> difficulty <b>in</b> keeping from laughter at <b>the</b> indignant surprise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests. But at <b>the</b> same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved <b>the</b> old hobbit dearly. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guests went <b>on</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking <b>and</b> discussing Bilbo Baggins” oddities, past <b>and</b> present; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses <b>had</b> already departed <b>in</b> wrath. Frodo did not want <b>to</b> have any more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>the</b> party. He gave orders for more wine <b>to</b> be served; then he got up <b>and</b> drained his own glass silently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> health <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> slipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pavilion.
<br>   As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he <b>was</b> making his speech, he <b>had</b> been fingering <b>the</b> golden ring <b>in</b> his pocket: his magic ring that he <b>had</b> kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> never seen <b>by</b> any hobbit <b>in</b> Hobbiton again.
<br>   He walked briskly back <b>to</b> his hole, <b>and</b> stood for a moment listening with a smile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> din <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pavilion <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> merrymaking <b>in</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. Then he went <b>in</b>. He took off his party clothes, folded up <b>and</b> wrapped <b>in</b> tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> away. Then he put <b>on</b> quickly some old untidy garments, <b>and</b> fastened round his waist a worn leather belt. On <b>it</b> he hung a short sword <b>in</b> a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling <b>of</b> moth-balls, he took out an old cloak <b>and</b> hood. They <b>had</b> been locked up as if they were <b>very</b> precious, <b>but</b> they were so patched <b>and</b> weatherstained that their original colour could hardly be guessed: <b>it</b> might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He then went <b>into</b> his study, <b>and</b> from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped <b>in</b> old cloths, <b>and</b> a leather-bound manuscript; <b>and</b> also a large bulky envelope. The <b>book</b> <b>and</b> bundle he stuffed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a heavy bag that <b>was</b> standing there, already nearly full. Into <b>the</b> envelope he slipped his golden ring, <b>and</b> its fine chain, <b>and</b> then sealed <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> addressed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo. At first he put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece, <b>but</b> suddenly he removed <b>it</b> <b>and</b> stuck <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his pocket. At that moment <b>the</b> door opened <b>and</b> Gandalf came quickly <b>in</b>.
<br>   “Hullo!” said Bilbo. “<b>I</b> wondered if you would turn up.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am glad <b>to</b> find you visible,” replied <b>the</b> wizard, <b>sitting</b> down <b>in</b> a chair, “<b>I</b> wanted <b>to</b> catch you <b>and</b> have a few final words. <b>I</b> suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly <b>and</b> according <b>to</b> plan?”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> <b>do</b>,” said Bilbo. “Though that flash <b>was</b> surprising: <b>it</b> quite startled me, let alone <b>the</b> others. A little addition <b>of</b> your own, <b>I</b> suppose?”
<br>   It <b>was</b>. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me necessary <b>to</b> give your guests something else that would seem <b>to</b> explain your sudden vanishment.”
<br>   “And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,” laughed Bilbo, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> expect you know best, as usual.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>—when <b>I</b> know anything. But <b>I</b> don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> final point. You have <b>had</b> your joke, <b>and</b> alarmed <b>or</b> offended most <b>of</b> your relations, <b>and</b> given <b>the</b> whole Shire something <b>to</b> talk about for nine days, <b>or</b> ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> am. <b>I</b> feel <b>I</b> need a holiday, a <b>very</b> long holiday, as <b>I</b> have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: <b>I</b> don’t expect <b>I</b> shall return. In fact, <b>I</b> don’t mean <b>to</b>, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have made all arrangements.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am old, Gandalf. <b>I</b> don’t look <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my heart <b>of</b> hearts. Well-preserved indeed!” he snorted. “Why, <b>I</b> feel all thin, sort <b>of</b> stretched, if you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. <b>I</b> need a change, <b>or</b> something.”
<br>   Gandalf looked curiously <b>and</b> closely at him. “No, <b>it</b> does not seem right,” he said thoughtfully. “No, after all <b>I</b> believe your plan <b>is</b> probably <b>the</b> best.”
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b>’ve made up my mind, anyway. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> see mountains again, Gandalf, mountains, <b>and</b> then find somewhere where <b>I</b> can rest. In peace <b>and</b> quiet, <b>without</b> a lot <b>of</b> relatives prying around, <b>and</b> a string <b>of</b> confounded visitors hanging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bell. <b>I</b> might find somewhere where <b>I</b> can finish my <b>book</b>. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a nice ending for <b>it</b>: <b>and</b> he lived happily ever after <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his days.”
<br>   Gandalf laughed. <b>I</b> hope he will. But nobody will read <b>the</b> <b>book</b>, however <b>it</b> ends.”
<br>   “Oh, they may, <b>in</b> years <b>to</b> come. Frodo has read some already, as far as <b>it</b> has gone. You’ll keep an eye <b>on</b> Frodo, won’t you?”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> will—two eyes, as often as <b>I</b> can spare them.”
<br>   “He would come with me, <b>of</b> course, if <b>I</b> asked him. In fact he offered <b>to</b> <b>once</b>, just before <b>the</b> party. But he does not really want <b>to</b>, yet. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> wild country again before <b>I</b> die, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains; <b>but</b> he <b>is</b> still <b>in</b> love with <b>the</b> Shire, with woods <b>and</b> fields <b>and</b> little rivers. He ought <b>to</b> be comfortable here. <b>I</b> am leaving everything <b>to</b> him, <b>of</b> course, except a few oddments. <b>I</b> hope he will be happy, when he gets used <b>to</b> being <b>on</b> his own. It’s time he <b>was</b> his own master now.”
<br>   “Everything?” said Gandalf. “The ring as well? You agreed <b>to</b> that, you remember.”
<br>   “Well, er, yes, <b>I</b> suppose so,” stammered Bilbo.
<br>   “Where <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “In an envelope, if you must know,” said Bilbo impatiently. “There <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece. Well, <b>no</b>! Here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> my pocket!” He hesitated. “Isn’t that odd now?” he said softly <b>to</b> himself. “Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t <b>it</b> stay there?”
<br>   Gandalf looked again <b>very</b> hard at Bilbo, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a gleam <b>in</b> his eyes. “<b>I</b> think, Bilbo,” he said quietly, “<b>I</b> should leave <b>it</b> behind. Don’t you want <b>to</b>?”
<br>   “Well yes—<b>and</b> <b>no</b>. Now <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> don’t like parting with <b>it</b> at all, <b>I</b> may say. And <b>I</b> don’t really see why <b>I</b> should. Why <b>do</b> you want me <b>to</b>?” he asked, <b>and</b> a curious change came over his voice. It <b>was</b> sharp with suspicion <b>and</b> annoyance. “You are always badgering me about my ring; <b>but</b> you have never bothered me about <b>the</b> other things that <b>I</b> got <b>on</b> my journey.”
<br>   “No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> badger you,” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> wanted <b>the</b> truth. It <b>was</b> important. Magic rings are—well, magical; <b>and</b> they are rare <b>and</b> curious. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> professionally interested <b>in</b> your ring, you may say; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still am. <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> know where <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, if you go wandering again. Also <b>I</b> think you have <b>had</b> <b>it</b> quite long enough. You won’t need <b>it</b> any more. Bilbo, unless <b>I</b> am quite mistaken.”
<br>   Bilbo flushed, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> an angry light <b>in</b> his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. “Why not?” he cried. “And <b>what</b> business <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>of</b> yours, anyway, <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with my own things? It <b>is</b> my own. <b>I</b> found <b>it</b>. It came <b>to</b> me.”
<br>   “Yes, yes,” said Gandalf. “But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry.”
<br>   “If <b>I</b> am <b>it</b> <b>is</b> your fault,” said Bilbo. “It <b>is</b> mine, <b>I</b> tell you. My own. My precious. Yes, my precious.”
<br>   The wizard’s face remained grave <b>and</b> attentive, <b>and</b> only a flicker <b>in</b> his deep eyes showed that he <b>was</b> startled <b>and</b> indeed alarmed. “It has been called that before,” he said, “<b>but</b> not <b>by</b> you.”
<br>   “But <b>I</b> say <b>it</b> now. And why not? Even if Gollum said <b>the</b> same <b>once</b>. It’s not his now, <b>but</b> mine. And <b>I</b> shall keep <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> say.”
<br>   Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. “You will be a fool if you <b>do</b>. Bilbo,” he said. “You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much hold <b>on</b> you. Let <b>it</b> go! And then you can go yourself, <b>and</b> be free.”
<br>   “<b>I</b>’ll <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> choose <b>and</b> go as <b>I</b> please,” said Bilbo obstinately.
<br>   “Now, now, my dear hobbit! “said Gandalf. “All your long life we have been friends, <b>and</b> you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give <b>it</b> up!”
<br>   “Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!” cried Bilbo. “But you won’t <b>get</b> <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> won’t give my precious away, <b>I</b> tell you.” His hand strayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his small sword.
<br>   Gandalf’s eyes flashed. It will be my turn <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry soon,” he said. If you say that again, <b>I</b> shall. Then you will see Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey uncloaked.” He took a step towards <b>the</b> hobbit, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> grow tall <b>and</b> menacing; his shadow filled <b>the</b> little room.
<br>   Bilbo backed away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room tingled. Gandalf’s eyes remained bent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, <b>and</b> he began <b>to</b> tremble.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t know <b>what</b> has come over you, Gandalf,” he said. “You have never been like this before. What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> all about? It <b>is</b> mine isn’t <b>it</b>? <b>I</b> found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> Gollum would have killed me, if <b>I</b> hadn’t kept <b>it</b>. <b>I</b>’m not a thief, whatever he said.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have never called you one,” Gandalf answered. “And <b>I</b> am not one either. <b>I</b> am not trying <b>to</b> rob you, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> help you. <b>I</b> wish you would trust me, as you used.” He turned away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow passed. He seemed <b>to</b> dwindle again <b>to</b> an old grey man, bent <b>and</b> troubled.
<br>   Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. <b>I</b> am sorry,” he said. “But <b>I</b> felt so queer. And yet <b>it</b> would be a relief <b>in</b> a way not <b>to</b> be bothered with <b>it</b> any more. It has been so growing <b>on</b> my mind lately. Sometimes <b>I</b> have felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like an eye looking at me. And <b>I</b> am always wanting <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> disappear, don’t you know; <b>or</b> wondering if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> safe, <b>and</b> pulling <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> make sure. <b>I</b> tried locking <b>it</b> up, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> couldn’t rest <b>without</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> my pocket. <b>I</b> don’t know why. And <b>I</b> don’t seem able <b>to</b> make up my mind.”
<br>   “Then trust mine,” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> quite made up. Go away <b>and</b> leave <b>it</b> behind. Stop possessing <b>it</b>. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will look after him.”
<br>   Bilbo stood for a moment tense <b>and</b> undecided. Presently he sighed. “All right,” he said with an effort. <b>I</b> will.” Then he shrugged his shoulders, <b>and</b> smiled rather ruefully. “After all that’s <b>what</b> this party business <b>was</b> all about, really: <b>to</b> give away lots <b>of</b> birthday presents, <b>and</b> somehow make <b>it</b> easier <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> away at <b>the</b> same time. It hasn’t made <b>it</b> any easier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> would be a pity <b>to</b> waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil <b>the</b> joke.”
<br>   “Indeed <b>it</b> would take away <b>the</b> only point <b>I</b> ever saw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affair,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Very well,” said Bilbo, “<b>it</b> goes <b>to</b> Frodo with all <b>the</b> rest.” He drew a deep breath. “And now <b>I</b> really must be starting, <b>or</b> somebody else will catch me. <b>I</b> have said good-bye, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t bear <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all over again.” He picked up his bag <b>and</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.
<br>   “You have still got <b>the</b> ring <b>in</b> your pocket,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Well, so <b>I</b> have!” cried Bilbo. “And my will <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> other documents too. You <b>had</b> better take <b>it</b> <b>and</b> deliver <b>it</b> for me. That will be safest.”
<br>   “No, don’t give <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> me,” said Gandalf. “Put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. <b>I</b> shall wait for him.”
<br>   Bilbo took out <b>the</b> envelope, <b>but</b> just as he <b>was</b> about <b>to</b> set <b>it</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clock, his hand jerked back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> packet fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Before he could pick <b>it</b> up, <b>the</b> wizard stooped <b>and</b> seized <b>it</b> <b>and</b> set <b>it</b> <b>in</b> its place. A spasm <b>of</b> anger passed swiftly over <b>the</b> hobbit’s face again. Suddenly <b>it</b> gave way <b>to</b> a look <b>of</b> relief <b>and</b> a laugh. “Well, that’s that,” he said. “Now <b>I</b>’m off!”
<br>   They went out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from <b>the</b> stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out <b>of</b> different rooms where they <b>had</b> been busy.
<br>   “Is everything ready?” asked Bilbo. “Everything packed <b>and</b> labelled?”
<br>   “Everything,” they answered.
<br>   “Well, let’s start then!” He stepped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front-door.
<br>   It <b>was</b> a fine night, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black sky <b>was</b> dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing <b>the</b> air. “What fun! What fun <b>to</b> be off again, off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road with dwarves! This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye! “he said, looking at his old home <b>and</b> bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. “Good-bye, Gandalf!”
<br>   “Good-bye, for <b>the</b> present, Bilbo. Take care <b>of</b> yourself! You are old enough, <b>and</b> perhaps wise enough.”
<br>   “Take care! <b>I</b> don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! <b>I</b> am as happy now as <b>I</b> have ever been, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> saying a great deal. But <b>the</b> time has come. <b>I</b> am being swept off my feet at last,” he added, <b>and</b> then <b>in</b> a low voice, as if <b>to</b> himself, he sang softly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark:
<br>   
<br>The Road goes ever <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b>
<br>Down from <b>the</b> door where <b>it</b> began.
<br>Now far ahead <b>the</b> Road has gone,
<br>And <b>I</b> must follow, if <b>I</b> can,
<br>Pursuing <b>it</b> with eager feet,
<br>Until <b>it</b> joins some larger way
<br>Where many paths <b>and</b> errands meet.
<br>And whither then? <b>I</b> cannot say.
<br>   
<br>   He paused, silent for a moment. Then <b>without</b> another word he turned away from <b>the</b> lights <b>and</b> voices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> tents, <b>and</b> followed <b>by</b> his three companions went round <b>into</b> his garden, <b>and</b> trotted down <b>the</b> long sloping path. He jumped over a low place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hedge at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>and</b> took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meadows, passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night like a rustle <b>of</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Gandalf remained for a while staring after him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. “Goodbye, my dear Bilbo—until our next meeting!” he said softly <b>and</b> went back indoors.
<br>   Frodo came <b>in</b> soon afterwards, <b>and</b> found him <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, deep <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>. “Has he gone?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes,” answered Gandalf, “he has gone at last.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish—<b>I</b> mean, <b>I</b> hoped until this evening that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a joke,” said Frodo. “But <b>I</b> knew <b>in</b> my heart that he really meant <b>to</b> go. He always used <b>to</b> joke about serious things. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come back sooner, just <b>to</b> see him off.”
<br>   <b>I</b> think really he preferred slipping off quietly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end,” said Gandalf. “Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right—now. He left a packet for you. There <b>it</b> <b>is</b>!”
<br>   Frodo took <b>the</b> envelope from <b>the</b> mantelpiece, <b>and</b> glanced at <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> did not open <b>it</b>.
<br>   “You’ll find his will <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> other documents <b>in</b> there, <b>I</b> think,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “You are <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> Bag End now. And also, <b>I</b> fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.”
<br>   “The ring!” exclaimed Frodo. “Has he left me that? <b>I</b> wonder why. Still, <b>it</b> may be useful.”
<br>   “It may, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may not,” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> should not make <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, if <b>I</b> were you. But keep <b>it</b> secret, <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> safe! Now <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> bed.”
<br>   As master <b>of</b> Bag End Frodo felt <b>it</b> his painful duty <b>to</b> say good-bye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guests. Rumours <b>of</b> strange events <b>had</b> <b>by</b> now spread all over <b>the</b> field, <b>but</b> Frodo would only say <b>no</b> doubt everything will be cleared up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. About midnight carriages came for <b>the</b> important folk. One <b>by</b> one they rolled away, filled with full <b>but</b> <b>very</b> unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came <b>by</b> arrangement, <b>and</b> removed <b>in</b> wheel-barrows those that <b>had</b> inadvertently remained behind.
<br>   Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went <b>on</b>. People came <b>and</b> began (<b>by</b> orders) <b>to</b> clear away <b>the</b> pavilions <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tables <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chairs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spoons <b>and</b> knives <b>and</b> bottles <b>and</b> plates, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lanterns, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flowering shrubs <b>in</b> boxes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> crumbs <b>and</b> cracker-paper, <b>the</b> forgotten bags <b>and</b> gloves <b>and</b> handkerchiefs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> uneaten food (a <b>very</b> small item). Then a number <b>of</b> other people came (<b>without</b> orders): Bagginses, <b>and</b> Boffins, <b>and</b> Bolgers, <b>and</b> Tooks, <b>and</b> other guests that lived <b>or</b> were staying near. By mid-day, when even <b>the</b> best-fed were out <b>and</b> about again, there <b>was</b> a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited <b>but</b> not unexpected.
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, smiling, <b>but</b> looking rather <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> worried. He welcomed all <b>the</b> callers, <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> not much more <b>to</b> say than before. His reply <b>to</b> all inquiries <b>was</b> simply this: “Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as <b>I</b> know, for good.” Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visitors he invited <b>to</b> come inside, as Bilbo <b>had</b> left “messages” for them.
<br>   Inside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall there <b>was</b> piled a large assortment <b>of</b> packages <b>and</b> parcels <b>and</b> small articles <b>of</b> furniture. On every item there <b>was</b> a label tied. There were several labels <b>of</b> this sort:
<br>   For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, <b>on</b> an umbrella. Adelard <b>had</b> carried off many unlabelled ones.
<br>   For DORA BAGGINS <b>in</b> memory <b>of</b> a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo, <b>on</b> a large waste-paper basket. Dora <b>was</b> Drogo’s <b>sister</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eldest surviving female relative <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ninety-nine, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> written reams <b>of</b> good advice for more than half a century.
<br>   For MILO BURROWS, hoping <b>it</b> will be useful, from B.B., <b>on</b> a gold pen <b>and</b> ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.
<br>   For ANGELICA’S <b>use</b>, from Uncle Bilbo, <b>on</b> a round convex mirror. She <b>was</b> a young Baggins, <b>and</b> too obviously considered <b>her</b> face shapely.
<br>   For <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, <b>on</b> an (empty) <b>book</b>-case. Hugo <b>was</b> a great borrower <b>of</b> books, <b>and</b> worse than usual at returning them.
<br>   For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, <b>on</b> a case <b>of</b> silver spoons. Bilbo believed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> acquired a good many <b>of</b> his spoons, while he <b>was</b> away <b>on</b> his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When <b>she</b> arrived later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day, <b>she</b> took <b>the</b> point at <b>once</b>, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> also took <b>the</b> spoons.
<br>   This <b>is</b> only a small selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence <b>had</b> got rather cluttered up with things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> his long life. It <b>was</b> a tendency <b>of</b> hobbit-holes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> cluttered up: for which <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> giving so many birthday-presents <b>was</b> largely responsible. Not, <b>of</b> course, that <b>the</b> birthday-presents were always new, there were one <b>or</b> two old mathoms <b>of</b> forgotten uses that <b>had</b> circulated all around <b>the</b> district; <b>but</b> Bilbo <b>had</b> usually given new presents, <b>and</b> kept those that he received. The old hole <b>was</b> now being cleared a little.
<br>   Every one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various parting gifts <b>had</b> labels, written out personally <b>by</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> several <b>had</b> some point, <b>or</b> some joke. But, <b>of</b> course, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things were given where they would be wanted <b>and</b> welcome. The poorer hobbits, <b>and</b> especially those <b>of</b> Bagshot Row, did <b>very</b> well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks <b>of</b> potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, <b>and</b> a bottle <b>of</b> ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, <b>in</b> return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles <b>of</b> Old Winyards: a strong red wine from <b>the</b> Southfarthing, <b>and</b> now quite mature, as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been laid down <b>by</b> Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, <b>and</b> voted him a capital fellow after <b>the</b> first bottle.
<br>   There <b>was</b> plenty <b>of</b> everything left for Frodo. And, <b>of</b> course, all <b>the</b> chief treasures, as well as <b>the</b> books, <b>pictures</b>, <b>and</b> more than enough furniture, were left <b>in</b> his possession. There <b>was</b>, however, <b>no</b> sign nor mention <b>of</b> money <b>or</b> jewellery: not a penny-piece <b>or</b> a glass bead <b>was</b> given away.
<br>   Frodo <b>had</b> a <b>very</b> trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that <b>the</b> whole household <b>was</b> being distributed free spread like wildfire; <b>and</b> before long <b>the</b> place <b>was</b> packed with people who <b>had</b> <b>no</b> business there, <b>but</b> could not be kept out. Labels got torn off <b>and</b> mixed, <b>and</b> quarrels broke out. Some people tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> swaps <b>and</b> deals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall; <b>and</b> others tried <b>to</b> make off with minor items not addressed <b>to</b> them, <b>or</b> with anything that seemed unwanted <b>or</b> unwatched. The road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate <b>was</b> blocked with barrows <b>and</b> handcarts.
<br>   In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commotion <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo <b>had</b> retired for a while <b>and</b> left his friend Merry Brandybuck <b>to</b> keep an eye <b>on</b> things. When Otho loudly demanded <b>to</b> see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.
<br>   “He <b>is</b> indisposed,” he said. “He <b>is</b> resting.”
<br>   “Hiding, you mean,” said Lobelia. “Anyway we want <b>to</b> see him <b>and</b> we mean <b>to</b> see him. Just go <b>and</b> tell him so!”
<br>   Merry left them a long while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> discover their parting gift <b>of</b> spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> study. Frodo <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> at a table with a lot <b>of</b> papers <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> him. He looked indisposed—<b>to</b> see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; <b>and</b> he stood up, fidgeting with something <b>in</b> his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.
<br>   The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began <b>by</b> offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable <b>and</b> unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only <b>the</b> things specially directed <b>by</b> Bilbo were being given away, they said <b>the</b> whole affair <b>was</b> <b>very</b> fishy.
<br>   “Only one thing <b>is</b> clear <b>to</b> me,” said Otho, “<b>and</b> that <b>is</b> that you are doing exceedingly well out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> insist <b>on</b> seeing <b>the</b> will.”
<br>   Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> Frodo. He read <b>the</b> will carefully <b>and</b> snorted. It <b>was</b>, unfortunately, <b>very</b> clear <b>and</b> correct (according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> legal customs <b>of</b> hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures <b>of</b> witnesses <b>in</b> red ink).
<br>   “Foiled again!” he said <b>to</b> his wife. “And after waiting sixty years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!” He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose <b>and</b> slumped off. But Lobelia <b>was</b> not so easily got rid <b>of</b>. A little later Frodo came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study <b>to</b> see how things were going <b>on</b> <b>and</b> found <b>her</b> still about <b>the</b> place, investigating nooks <b>and</b> comers <b>and</b> tapping <b>the</b> floors. He escorted <b>her</b> firmly off <b>the</b> premises, after he <b>had</b> relieved <b>her</b> <b>of</b> several small (<b>but</b> rather valuable) articles that <b>had</b> somehow fallen inside <b>her</b> umbrella. Her face looked as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> throes <b>of</b> thinking out a really crushing parting remark; <b>but</b> all <b>she</b> found <b>to</b> say, turning round <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, <b>was</b>:
<br>   “You’ll live <b>to</b> regret <b>it</b>, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong here; you’re <b>no</b> Baggins—you—you’re a Brandybuck!”
<br>   “Did you hear that, Merry? That <b>was</b> an insult, if you like,” said Frodo as he shut <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> <b>her</b>.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> a compliment,” said Merry Brandybuck, “<b>and</b> so, <b>of</b> course, not true.”
<br>   Then they went round <b>the</b> hole, <b>and</b> evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins <b>and</b> a Bolger) who were knocking holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cellars. Frodo also <b>had</b> a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who <b>had</b> begun an excavation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> larger pantry, where he <b>thought</b> there <b>was</b> an echo. The legend <b>of</b> Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity <b>and</b> hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), <b>is</b>, as every one knows, any one’s for <b>the</b> finding—unless <b>the</b> search <b>is</b> interrupted.
<br>   When he <b>had</b> overcome Sancho <b>and</b> pushed him out, Frodo collapsed <b>on</b> a chair <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall. It’s time <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> shop, Merry,” he said. “Lock <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> don’t open <b>it</b> <b>to</b> anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.” Then he went <b>to</b> revive himself with a belated cup <b>of</b> tea.
<br>   He <b>had</b> hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at <b>the</b> front-door. “Lobelia again most likely,” he <b>thought</b>. “She must have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> something really nasty, <b>and</b> have come back again <b>to</b> say <b>it</b>. It can wait.”
<br>   He went <b>on</b> with his tea. The knock <b>was</b> repeated, much louder, <b>but</b> he took <b>no</b> notice. Suddenly <b>the</b> wizard’s head appeared at <b>the</b> window.
<br>   “If you don’t let me <b>in</b>, Frodo, <b>I</b> shall blow your door right down your hole <b>and</b> out through <b>the</b> hill,” he said.
<br>   “My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!” cried Frodo, running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. “Come <b>in</b>! Come <b>in</b>! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Lobelia.”
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> forgive you. But <b>I</b> saw <b>her</b> some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.”
<br>   “She <b>had</b> already nearly curdled me. Honestly, <b>I</b> nearly tried <b>on</b> Bilbo’s ring. <b>I</b> longed <b>to</b> disappear.”
<br>   “Don’t <b>do</b> that!” said Gandalf, <b>sitting</b> down. “Do be careful <b>of</b> that ring, Frodo! In fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> partly about that that <b>I</b> have come <b>to</b> say a last word.”
<br>   “Well, <b>what</b> about <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you know already?”
<br>   “Only <b>what</b> Bilbo told me. <b>I</b> have heard his story: how he found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> how he used <b>it</b>: <b>on</b> his journey, <b>I</b> mean.”
<br>   “Which story, <b>I</b> wonder,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Oh, not <b>what</b> he told <b>the</b> dwarves <b>and</b> put <b>in</b> his <b>book</b>,” said Frodo. “He told me <b>the</b> true story soon after <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> live here. He said you <b>had</b> pestered him till he told you, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better know too. “No secrets between us, Frodo,” he said; “<b>but</b> they are not <b>to</b> go any further. It’s mine anyway.”
<br>   “That’s interesting,” said Gandalf. “Well, <b>what</b> did you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all?”
<br>   “If you mean, inventing all that about a “present", well, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> true story much more likely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t see <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> altering <b>it</b> at all. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> unlike Bilbo <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, anyway; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> rather odd.”
<br>   “So did <b>I</b>. But odd things may happen <b>to</b> people that have such treasures—if they <b>use</b> them. Let <b>it</b> be a warning <b>to</b> you <b>to</b> be <b>very</b> careful with <b>it</b>. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t understand,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Neither <b>do</b> <b>I</b>,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. “<b>I</b> have merely begun <b>to</b> wonder about <b>the</b> ring, especially since last night. No need <b>to</b> worry. But if you take my advice you will <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> seldom, <b>or</b> not at all. At least <b>I</b> beg you not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> any way that will cause talk <b>or</b> rouse suspicion. <b>I</b> say again: keep <b>it</b> safe, <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> secret!”
<br>   “You are <b>very</b> mysterious! What are you afraid <b>of</b>?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am not certain, so <b>I</b> will say <b>no</b> more. <b>I</b> may be able <b>to</b> tell you something when <b>I</b> come back. <b>I</b> am going off at <b>once</b>: so this <b>is</b> good-bye for <b>the</b> present.” He got up.
<br>   “At <b>once</b>!” cried Frodo. “Why, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were staying <b>on</b> for at least a week. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking forward <b>to</b> your help.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> did mean <b>to</b>—<b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change my mind. <b>I</b> may be away for a good while; <b>but</b> <b>I</b>’ll come <b>and</b> see you again, as soon as <b>I</b> can. Expect me when you see me! <b>I</b> shall slip <b>in</b> quietly. <b>I</b> shan’t often be visiting <b>the</b> Shire openly again. <b>I</b> find that <b>I</b> have become rather unpopular. They say <b>I</b> am a nuisance <b>and</b> a disturber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace. Some people are actually accusing me <b>of</b> spiriting Bilbo away, <b>or</b> worse. If you want <b>to</b> know, there <b>is</b> supposed <b>to</b> be a plot between you <b>and</b> me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> his wealth.”
<br>   “Some people!” exclaimed Frodo. “You mean Otho <b>and</b> Lobelia. How abominable! <b>I</b> would give them Bag End <b>and</b> everything else, if <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> Bilbo back <b>and</b> go off tramping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country with him. <b>I</b> love <b>the</b> Shire. But <b>I</b> begin <b>to</b> wish, somehow, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gone too. <b>I</b> wonder if <b>I</b> shall ever see him again.”
<br>   “So <b>do</b> <b>I</b>,” said Gandalf. “And <b>I</b> wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care <b>of</b> yourself! Look out for me, especially at unlikely times! Good-bye!”
<br>   Frodo saw him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. He gave a final wave <b>of</b> his hand, <b>and</b> walked off at a surprising pace; <b>but</b> Frodo <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he <b>was</b> carrying a great weight. The evening <b>was</b> closing <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> his cloaked figure quickly vanished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 2
<br><b>THE</b> SHADOW OF <b>THE</b> PAST
<br>
<br>   The talk did not die down <b>in</b> nine <b>or</b> even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo Baggins <b>was</b> discussed <b>in</b> Hobbiton, <b>and</b> indeed all over <b>the</b> Shire, for a year <b>and</b> a day, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; <b>and</b> eventually Mad Baggins, who used <b>to</b> vanish with a bang <b>and</b> a flash <b>and</b> reappear with bags <b>of</b> jewels <b>and</b> gold, became a favourite character <b>of</b> legend <b>and</b> lived <b>on</b> long after all <b>the</b> true events were forgotten.
<br>   But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime, <b>the</b> general opinion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood <b>was</b> that Bilbo, who <b>had</b> always been rather cracked, <b>had</b> at last gone quite mad, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> run off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Blue. There he <b>had</b> undoubtedly fallen <b>into</b> a pool <b>or</b> a river <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> a tragic, <b>but</b> hardly an untimely, end. The blame <b>was</b> mostly laid <b>on</b> Gandalf.
<br>   “If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle down <b>and</b> grow some hobbit-sense,” they said. And <b>to</b> all appearance <b>the</b> wizard did leave Frodo alone, <b>and</b> he did settle down, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> hobbit-sense <b>was</b> not <b>very</b> noticeable. Indeed, he at <b>once</b> began <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> Bilbo’s reputation for oddity. He refused <b>to</b> go <b>into</b> mourning; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next year he gave a party <b>in</b> honour <b>of</b> Bilbo’s hundred-<b>and</b>-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that <b>was</b> short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mark, for twenty guests were invited <b>and</b> there were several meals at which <b>it</b> snowed food <b>and</b> rained drink, as hobbits say.
<br>   Some people were rather shocked; <b>but</b> Frodo kept up <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they got used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. He said that he did not think Bilbo <b>was</b> dead. When they asked: “Where <b>is</b> he then?” he shrugged his shoulders.
<br>   He lived alone, as Bilbo <b>had</b> done; <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> a good many friends, especially among <b>the</b> younger hobbits (mostly descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Took) who <b>had</b> as children been fond <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> often <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> Bag End. Folco Boffin <b>and</b> Fredegar Bolger were two <b>of</b> these; <b>but</b> his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), <b>and</b> Merry Brandybuck (his real name <b>was</b> Meriadoc, <b>but</b> that <b>was</b> seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over <b>the</b> Shire with them; <b>but</b> more often he wandered <b>by</b> himself, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amazement <b>of</b> sensible folk he <b>was</b> sometimes seen far from home walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> woods under <b>the</b> starlight. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin suspected that he visited <b>the</b> Elves at times, as Bilbo <b>had</b> done.
<br>   As time went <b>on</b>, people began <b>to</b> notice that Frodo also showed signs <b>of</b> good “preservation”: outwardly he retained <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> a robust <b>and</b> energetic hobbit just out <b>of</b> his tweens. “Some folk have all <b>the</b> luck,” they said; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not until Frodo approached <b>the</b> usually more sober age <b>of</b> fifty that they began <b>to</b> think <b>it</b> queer.
<br>   Frodo himself, after <b>the</b> first shock, found that being his own master <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mr. Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End <b>was</b> rather pleasant. For some years he <b>was</b> quite happy <b>and</b> did not worry much about <b>the</b> future. But half unknown <b>to</b> himself <b>the</b> regret that he <b>had</b> not gone with Bilbo <b>was</b> steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn, about <b>the</b> wild lands, <b>and</b> strange visions <b>of</b> mountains that he <b>had</b> never seen came <b>into</b> his dreams. He began <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> himself: “Perhaps <b>I</b> shall cross <b>the</b> River myself one day.” To which <b>the</b> other half <b>of</b> his mind always replied: “Not yet.”
<br>   So <b>it</b> went <b>on</b>, until his forties were running out, <b>and</b> his fiftieth birthday <b>was</b> drawing near: fifty <b>was</b> a number that he felt <b>was</b> somehow significant (<b>or</b> ominous); <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at any rate at that age that adventure <b>had</b> suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began <b>to</b> feel restless, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, <b>and</b> wondered <b>what</b> lay beyond their edges: maps made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took <b>to</b> wandering further afield <b>and</b> more often <b>by</b> himself; <b>and</b> Merry <b>and</b> his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he <b>was</b> seen walking <b>and</b> talking with <b>the</b> strange wayfarers that began at this time <b>to</b> appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   There were rumours <b>of</b> strange things happening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world outside; <b>and</b> as Gandalf <b>had</b> not at that time appeared <b>or</b> sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all <b>the</b> news he could. Elves, who seldom walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, could now be seen passing westward through <b>the</b> woods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, passing <b>and</b> not returning; <b>but</b> they were leaving Middle-earth <b>and</b> were <b>no</b> longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road <b>in</b> unusual numbers. The ancient East-West Road ran through <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> its end at <b>the</b> Grey Havens, <b>and</b> dwarves <b>had</b> always used <b>it</b> <b>on</b> their way <b>to</b> their mines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blue Mountains. They were <b>the</b> hobbits” chief source <b>of</b> news from distant parts—if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little <b>and</b> hobbits asked <b>no</b> more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves <b>of</b> far countries, seeking refuge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. They were troubled, <b>and</b> some spoke <b>in</b> whispers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   That name <b>the</b> hobbits only knew <b>in</b> legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark past, like a shadow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> their memories; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ominous <b>and</b> disquieting. It seemed that <b>the</b> evil power <b>in</b> Mirkwood <b>had</b> been driven out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> White Council only <b>to</b> reappear <b>in</b> greater strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old strongholds <b>of</b> Mordor. The Dark Tower <b>had</b> been rebuilt, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said. From there <b>the</b> power <b>was</b> spreading far <b>and</b> wide, <b>and</b> away far east <b>and</b> south there were wars <b>and</b> growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. Trolls were abroad, <b>no</b> longer dull-witted, <b>but</b> cunning <b>and</b> armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints <b>of</b> creatures more terrible than all these, <b>but</b> they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> name.
<br>   Little <b>of</b> all this, <b>of</b> course, reached <b>the</b> ears <b>of</b> ordinary hobbits. But even <b>the</b> deafest <b>and</b> most stay-at-home began <b>to</b> hear queer tales; <b>and</b> those whose business took them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders saw strange things. The <b>conversation</b> <b>in</b> The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comfortable heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire rumours <b>had</b> been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.
<br>   Sam Gamgee <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> one corner near <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> opposite him <b>was</b> Ted Sandyman, <b>the</b> miller’s son; <b>and</b> there were various other rustic hobbits listening <b>to</b> their talk.
<br>   “Queer things you <b>do</b> hear these days, <b>to</b> be sure,” said Sam.
<br>   “Ah,” said Ted, “you <b>do</b>, if you listen. But <b>I</b> can hear fireside-tales <b>and</b> children’s stories at home, if <b>I</b> want <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “No doubt you can,” retorted Sam, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> daresay there’s more truth <b>in</b> some <b>of</b> them than you reckon. Who invented <b>the</b> stories anyway? Take dragons now.”
<br>   “No thank “ee,” said Ted, “<b>I</b> won’t. <b>I</b> heard tell <b>of</b> them when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a youngster, <b>but</b> there’s <b>no</b> call <b>to</b> believe <b>in</b> them now. There’s only one Dragon <b>in</b> Bywater, <b>and</b> that’s Green,” he said, getting a general laugh.
<br>   “All right,” said Sam, laughing with <b>the</b> rest. “But <b>what</b> about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They <b>do</b> say that one bigger than a tree <b>was</b> seen up away beyond <b>the</b> North Moors not long back.”
<br>   “Who’s they?”
<br>   “My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill <b>and</b> goes up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northfarthing for <b>the</b> hunting. He saw one.”
<br>   “Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; <b>and</b> maybe he sees things that ain’t there.”
<br>   “But this one <b>was</b> as big as an elm tree, <b>and</b> walking—walking seven yards <b>to</b> a stride, if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an inch.”
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> bet <b>it</b> wasn’t an inch. What he saw <b>was</b> an elm tree, as like as not.”
<br>   “But this one <b>was</b> walking, <b>I</b> tell you; <b>and</b> there ain’t <b>no</b> elm tree <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Moors.”
<br>   “Then Hal can’t have seen one,” said Ted. There <b>was</b> some laughing <b>and</b> clapping: <b>the</b> audience seemed <b>to</b> think that Ted <b>had</b> scored a point.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same,” said Sam, “you can’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing <b>the</b> Shire—crossing <b>it</b>, mind you: there are more that are turned back at <b>the</b> borders. The Bounders have never been so busy before.
<br>   “And <b>I</b>’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They <b>do</b> say they are going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbours, out away beyond <b>the</b> White Towers.” Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any <b>of</b> them knew how far <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea, past <b>the</b> old towers beyond <b>the</b> western borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an old tradition that away over there stood <b>the</b> Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never <b>to</b> return.
<br>   “They are sailing, sailing, sailing over <b>the</b> Sea, they are going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> leaving us,” said Sam, half chanting <b>the</b> words, shaking his head sadly <b>and</b> solemnly. But Ted laughed.
<br>   “Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe <b>the</b> old tales. And <b>I</b> don’t see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> matters <b>to</b> me <b>or</b> you. Let them sail! But <b>I</b> warrant you haven’t seen them doing <b>it</b>; nor any one else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire.”
<br>   “Well <b>I</b> don’t know,” said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he <b>had</b> <b>once</b> seen an Elf <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, <b>and</b> still hoped <b>to</b> see more one day. Of all <b>the</b> legends that he <b>had</b> heard <b>in</b> his early years such fragments <b>of</b> tales <b>and</b> half-remembered stories about <b>the</b> Elves as <b>the</b> hobbits knew, <b>had</b> always moved him most deeply. “There are some, even <b>in</b> these parts, as know <b>the</b> Fair Folk <b>and</b> <b>get</b> news <b>of</b> them,” he said. “There’s Mr. Baggins now, that <b>I</b> work for. He told me that they were sailing <b>and</b> he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many’s <b>the</b> talk <b>I</b> <b>had</b> with him when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little lad.”
<br>   “Oh, they’re both cracked,” said Ted. “Leastways old Bilbo <b>was</b> cracked, <b>and</b> Frodo’s cracking. If that’s where you <b>get</b> your news from, you’ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, <b>I</b>’m off home. Your good health!” He drained his mug <b>and</b> went out noisily.
<br>   Sam sat silent <b>and</b> said <b>no</b> more. He <b>had</b> a good deal <b>to</b> think about. For one thing, there <b>was</b> a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bag End garden, <b>and</b> he would have a busy day tomorrow, if <b>the</b> weather cleared. The grass <b>was</b> growing fast. But Sam <b>had</b> more <b>on</b> his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, <b>and</b> got up <b>and</b> went out.
<br>   It <b>was</b> early April <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> now clearing after heavy rain. The sun <b>was</b> down, <b>and</b> a cool pale evening <b>was</b> quietly fading <b>into</b> night. He walked home under <b>the</b> early stars through Hobbiton <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> Hill, whistling softly <b>and</b> thoughtfully.
<br>   It <b>was</b> just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after <b>the</b> Party he <b>had</b> been away. Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, <b>and</b> after taking a good look at him he went off again. During <b>the</b> next year <b>or</b> two he <b>had</b> turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, <b>and</b> going off <b>without</b> warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business <b>and</b> journeys, <b>and</b> seemed chiefly interested <b>in</b> small news about Frodo’s health <b>and</b> doings.
<br>   Then suddenly his visits <b>had</b> ceased. It <b>was</b> over nine years since Frodo <b>had</b> seen <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> wizard would never return <b>and</b> <b>had</b> given up all interest <b>in</b> hobbits. But that evening, as Sam <b>was</b> walking home <b>and</b> twilight <b>was</b> fading, there came <b>the</b> <b>once</b> familiar tap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> study window.
<br>   Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise <b>and</b> great delight. They looked hard at one another.
<br>   “Ah well eh?” said Gandalf. “You look <b>the</b> same as ever, Frodo!”
<br>   “So <b>do</b> you,” Frodo replied; <b>but</b> secretly he <b>thought</b> that Gandalf looked older <b>and</b> more careworn. He pressed him for news <b>of</b> himself <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide world, <b>and</b> soon they were deep <b>in</b> talk, <b>and</b> they stayed up far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   Next morning after a late breakfast, <b>the</b> wizard <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> with Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open window <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study. A bright fire <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> warm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South. Everything looked fresh, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new green <b>of</b> Spring <b>was</b> shimmering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees” fingers.
<br>   Gandalf <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b> a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo <b>had</b> run out <b>of</b> Bag End <b>without</b> a handkerchief. His hair <b>was</b> perhaps whiter than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been then, <b>and</b> his beard <b>and</b> eyebrows were perhaps longer, <b>and</b> his face more lined with care <b>and</b> wisdom; <b>but</b> his eyes were as bright as ever, <b>and</b> he smoked <b>and</b> blew smoke-rings with <b>the</b> same vigour <b>and</b> delight.
<br>   He <b>was</b> smoking now <b>in</b> silence, for Frodo <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> still, deep <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> morning he felt <b>the</b> dark shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tidings that Gandalf <b>had</b> brought. At last he broke <b>the</b> silence.
<br>   “Last night you began <b>to</b> tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,” he said. “And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left until daylight. Don’t you think you <b>had</b> better finish now? You say <b>the</b> ring <b>is</b> dangerous, far more dangerous than <b>I</b> guess. In <b>what</b> way?”
<br>   “In many ways,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. It <b>is</b> far more powerful than <b>I</b> ever dared <b>to</b> think at first, so powerful that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>it</b> would utterly overcome anyone <b>of</b> mortal race who possessed <b>it</b>. It would possess him.
<br>   “In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, <b>and</b> they were, <b>of</b> course, <b>of</b> various kinds: some more potent <b>and</b> some less. The lesser rings were only essays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> craft before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> full-grown, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elven-smiths they were <b>but</b> trifles—yet still <b>to</b> my mind dangerous for mortals. But <b>the</b> Great Rings, <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, they were perilous.
<br>   “A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Rings, does not die, <b>but</b> he does not grow <b>or</b> obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last every minute <b>is</b> a weariness. And if he often uses <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> make himself invisible, he fades: he becomes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end invisible permanently, <b>and</b> walks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twilight under <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark power that rules <b>the</b> Rings. Yes, sooner <b>or</b> later—later, if he <b>is</b> strong <b>or</b> well-meaning <b>to</b> begin with, <b>but</b> neither strength nor good purpose will last—sooner <b>or</b> later <b>the</b> dark power will devour him.”
<br>   “How terrifying!” said Frodo. There <b>was</b> another long silence. The sound <b>of</b> Sam Gamgee cutting <b>the</b> lawn came <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> garden.
<br>   “How long have you known this?” asked Frodo at length. “And how much did Bilbo know?”
<br>   “Bilbo knew <b>no</b> more than he told you, <b>I</b> am sure,” said Gandalf. “He would certainly never have passed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> you anything that he <b>thought</b> would be a danger, even though <b>I</b> promised <b>to</b> look after you. He <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>was</b> <b>very</b> beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> useful at need; <b>and</b> if anything <b>was</b> wrong <b>or</b> queer, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> himself. He said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> “growing <b>on</b> his mind”, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> always worrying about <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> he did not suspect that <b>the</b> ring itself <b>was</b> <b>to</b> blame. Though he <b>had</b> found out that <b>the</b> thing needed looking after; <b>it</b> did not seem always <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size <b>or</b> weight; <b>it</b> shrank <b>or</b> expanded <b>in</b> an odd way, <b>and</b> might suddenly slip off a finger where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been tight.”
<br>   “Yes, he warned me <b>of</b> that <b>in</b> his last letter,” said Frodo, “so <b>I</b> have always kept <b>it</b> <b>on</b> its chain.”
<br>   “Very wise,” said Gandalf. “But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> ring at all. He took all <b>the</b> credit for that <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> proud <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Though he <b>was</b> getting restless <b>and</b> uneasy. Thin <b>and</b> stretched he said. A sign that <b>the</b> ring <b>was</b> getting control.”
<br>   “How long have you known all this?” asked Frodo again.
<br>   “Known?” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> have known much that only <b>the</b> Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean “known about this ring”, well, <b>I</b> still <b>do</b> not know, one might say. There <b>is</b> a last test <b>to</b> make. But <b>I</b> <b>no</b> longer doubt my guess.
<br>   “When did <b>I</b> first begin <b>to</b> guess?” he mused, searching back <b>in</b> memory. “Let me see—<b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year that <b>the</b> White Council drove <b>the</b> dark power from Mirkwood, just before <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell <b>on</b> my heart then, though <b>I</b> did not know yet <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feared. <b>I</b> wondered often how Gollum came <b>by</b> a Great Ring, as plainly <b>it</b> <b>was</b>—that at least <b>was</b> clear from <b>the</b> first. Then <b>I</b> heard Bilbo’s strange story <b>of</b> how he <b>had</b> “won” <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could not believe <b>it</b>. When <b>I</b> at last got <b>the</b> truth out <b>of</b> him, <b>I</b> saw at <b>once</b> that he <b>had</b> been trying <b>to</b> put his claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his “birthday present”. The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly <b>the</b> ring <b>had</b> an unwholesome power that set <b>to</b> work <b>on</b> its keeper at <b>once</b>. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first real warning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> that all <b>was</b> not well. <b>I</b> told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; <b>but</b> he resented <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> soon got angry. There <b>was</b> little else that <b>I</b> could <b>do</b>. <b>I</b> could not take <b>it</b> from him <b>without</b> doing greater harm; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so anyway. <b>I</b> could only watch <b>and</b> wait. <b>I</b> might perhaps have consulted Saruman <b>the</b> White, <b>but</b> something always held me back.”
<br>   “Who <b>is</b> he?” asked Frodo. <b>I</b> have never heard <b>of</b> him before.”
<br>   “Maybe not,” answered Gandalf. “Hobbits are, <b>or</b> were, <b>no</b> concern <b>of</b> his. Yet he <b>is</b> great among <b>the</b> Wise. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> chief <b>of</b> my order <b>and</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council. His knowledge <b>is</b> deep, <b>but</b> his pride has grown with <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> he takes ill any meddling. The lore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-rings, great <b>and</b> small, <b>is</b> his province. He has long studied <b>it</b>, seeking <b>the</b> lost secrets <b>of</b> their making; <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Rings were debated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Council, all that he would reveal <b>to</b> us <b>of</b> his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept—<b>but</b> uneasily. Still <b>I</b> watched <b>and</b> <b>I</b> waited.
<br>   “And all seemed well with Bilbo. And <b>the</b> years passed. Yes, they passed, <b>and</b> they seemed not <b>to</b> touch him. He showed <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> age. The shadow fell <b>on</b> me again. But <b>I</b> said <b>to</b> myself: “After all he comes <b>of</b> a long-lived family <b>on</b> his mother’s side. There <b>is</b> time yet. Wait!”
<br>   “And <b>I</b> waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said <b>and</b> did things then that filled me with a fear that <b>no</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman could allay. <b>I</b> knew at last that something dark <b>and</b> deadly <b>was</b> at work. And <b>I</b> have spent most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> years since then <b>in</b> finding out <b>the</b> truth <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “There wasn’t any permanent harm done, <b>was</b> there?” asked Frodo anxiously. “He would <b>get</b> all right <b>in</b> time, wouldn’t he? Be able <b>to</b> rest <b>in</b> peace, <b>I</b> mean?”
<br>   “He felt better at <b>once</b>,” said Gandalf. “But there <b>is</b> only one Power <b>in</b> this world that knows all about <b>the</b> Rings <b>and</b> their effects; <b>and</b> as far as <b>I</b> know there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> Power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world that knows all about hobbits. Among <b>the</b> Wise <b>I</b> am <b>the</b> only one that goes <b>in</b> for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch <b>of</b> knowledge, <b>but</b> full <b>of</b> surprises. Soft as butter they can be, <b>and</b> yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> likely that some would resist <b>the</b> Rings far longer than most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise would believe. <b>I</b> don’t think you need worry about Bilbo.
<br>   “Of course, he possessed <b>the</b> ring for many years, <b>and</b> used <b>it</b>, so <b>it</b> might take a long while for <b>the</b> influence <b>to</b> wear off—before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> safe for him <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live <b>on</b> for years, quite happily: just stop as he <b>was</b> when he parted with <b>it</b>. For he gave <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his own accord: an important point. No, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not troubled about dear Bilbo any more, <b>once</b> he <b>had</b> let <b>the</b> thing go. It <b>is</b> for you that <b>I</b> feel responsible.
<br>   “Ever since Bilbo left <b>I</b> have been deeply concerned about you, <b>and</b> about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world, if <b>the</b> Dark Power overcame <b>the</b> Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest, not <b>to</b> mention <b>the</b> ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.”
<br>   Frodo shuddered. “But why should we be?” he asked. “And why should he want such slaves?”
<br>   “To tell you <b>the</b> truth,” replied Gandalf, “<b>I</b> believe that hitherto—hitherto, mark you—he has entirely overlooked <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you—he has many more useful servants—<b>but</b> he won’t forget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy <b>and</b> free. There <b>is</b> such a thing as malice <b>and</b> revenge.”
<br>   “Revenge?” said Frodo. “Revenge for <b>what</b>? <b>I</b> still don’t understand <b>what</b> all this has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Bilbo <b>and</b> myself, <b>and</b> our ring.”
<br>   “It has everything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it</b>,” said Gandalf. “You <b>do</b> not know <b>the</b> real peril yet; <b>but</b> you shall. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not sure <b>of</b> <b>it</b> myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> last here; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> time has come <b>to</b> speak. Give me <b>the</b> ring for a moment.”
<br>   Frodo took <b>it</b> from his breeches-pocket, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clasped <b>to</b> a chain that hung from his belt. He unfastened <b>it</b> <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wizard. It felt suddenly <b>very</b> heavy, as if either <b>it</b> <b>or</b> Frodo himself <b>was</b> <b>in</b> some way reluctant for Gandalf <b>to</b> touch <b>it</b>.
<br>   Gandalf held <b>it</b> up. It looked <b>to</b> be made <b>of</b> pure <b>and</b> solid gold. “Can you see any markings <b>on</b> <b>it</b>?” he asked.
<br>   “No,” said Frodo. “There are none. It <b>is</b> quite plain, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> never shows a scratch <b>or</b> sign <b>of</b> wear.”
<br>   “Well then, look!” To Frodo’s astonishment <b>and</b> distress <b>the</b> wizard threw <b>it</b> suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a glowing corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. Frodo gave a cry <b>and</b> groped for <b>the</b> tongs; <b>but</b> Gandalf held him back.
<br>   “Wait!” he said <b>in</b> a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows.
<br>   No apparent change came over <b>the</b> ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed <b>the</b> shutters outside <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> curtains. The room became dark <b>and</b> silent, though <b>the</b> clack <b>of</b> Sam’s shears, now nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> windows, could still be heard faintly from <b>the</b> garden. For a moment <b>the</b> wizard stood looking at <b>the</b> fire; then he stooped <b>and</b> removed <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hearth with <b>the</b> tongs, <b>and</b> at <b>once</b> picked <b>it</b> up. Frodo gasped.
<br>   It <b>is</b> quite cool,” said Gandalf. “Take <b>it</b>!” Frodo received <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his shrinking palm: <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have become thicker <b>and</b> heavier than ever.
<br>   “Hold <b>it</b> up!” said Gandalf. “And look closely!”
<br>   As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than <b>the</b> finest pen-strokes, running along <b>the</b> ring, outside <b>and</b> inside: lines <b>of</b> fire that seemed <b>to</b> form <b>the</b> letters <b>of</b> a flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, <b>and</b> yet remote, as if out <b>of</b> a great depth.
<br>   
<br>   <b>I</b> cannot read <b>the</b> fiery letters,” said Frodo <b>in</b> a quavering voice.
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> can. The letters are Elvish, <b>of</b> an ancient mode, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> language <b>is</b> that <b>of</b> Mordor, which <b>I</b> will not utter here. But this <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Common Tongue <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said, close enough:
<br>   
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all, One Ring <b>to</b> find them,
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness bind them.
<br>   
<br>   It <b>is</b> only two lines <b>of</b> a verse long known <b>in</b> Elven-lore:
<br>   
<br>Three Rings for <b>the</b> Elven-kings under <b>the</b> sky,
<br>Seven for <b>the</b> Dwarf-lords <b>in</b> their halls <b>of</b> stone,
<br>   Nine for Mortal Men doomed <b>to</b> die,
<br>   One for <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>on</b> his dark throne
<br>   In <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor where <b>the</b> Shadows lie.
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all. One Ring <b>to</b> find them,
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness bind them
<br>   In <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor where <b>the</b> Shadows lie.”
<br>   
<br>   He paused, <b>and</b> then said slowly <b>in</b> a deep voice: “This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Master-ring, <b>the</b> One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> One Ring that he lost many ages ago, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great weakening <b>of</b> his power. He greatly desires <b>it</b>—<b>but</b> he must not <b>get</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo sat silent <b>and</b> motionless. Fear seemed <b>to</b> stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> looming up <b>to</b> engulf him. “This ring!” he stammered. “How, how <b>on</b> earth did <b>it</b> come <b>to</b> me?”
<br>   “Ah!” said Gandalf. “That <b>is</b> a <b>very</b> long story. The beginnings lie back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Black Years, which only <b>the</b> lore-masters now remember. If <b>I</b> were <b>to</b> tell you all that tale, we should still be <b>sitting</b> here when Spring <b>had</b> passed <b>into</b> Winter.
<br>   “But last night <b>I</b> told you <b>of</b> Sauron <b>the</b> Great, <b>the</b> Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again <b>and</b> left his hold <b>in</b> Mirkwood <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> his ancient fastness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>of</b> Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard <b>of</b>, like a shadow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> old stories. Always after a defeat <b>and</b> a respite, <b>the</b> Shadow takes another shape <b>and</b> grows again.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish <b>it</b> need not have happened <b>in</b> my time,” said Frodo.
<br>   “So <b>do</b> <b>I</b>,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> so <b>do</b> all who live <b>to</b> see such times. But that <b>is</b> not for them <b>to</b> decide. All we have <b>to</b> decide <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>the</b> time that <b>is</b> given, us. And already, Frodo, our time <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> look black. The Enemy <b>is</b> fast becoming <b>very</b> strong. His plans are far from ripe, <b>I</b> think, <b>but</b> they are ripening. We shall be hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. We should be <b>very</b> hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, even if <b>it</b> were not for this dreadful chance.
<br>   “The Enemy still lacks one thing <b>to</b> give him strength <b>and</b> knowledge <b>to</b> beat down all resistance, break <b>the</b> last defences, <b>and</b> cover all <b>the</b> lands <b>in</b> a second darkness. He lacks <b>the</b> One Ring.
<br>   “The Three, fairest <b>of</b> all, <b>the</b> Elf-lords hid from him, <b>and</b> his hand never touched them <b>or</b> sullied them. Seven <b>the</b> Dwarf-kings possessed, <b>but</b> three he has recovered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others <b>the</b> dragons have consumed. Nine he gave <b>to</b> Mortal Men, proud <b>and</b> great, <b>and</b> so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under <b>the</b> dominion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It <b>is</b> many a year since <b>the</b> Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As <b>the</b> Shadow grows <b>once</b> more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak <b>of</b> such things even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now: <b>the</b> Nine he has gathered <b>to</b> himself; <b>the</b> Seven also, <b>or</b> else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that <b>no</b> longer troubles him. He only needs <b>the</b> One; for he made that Ring himself, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> his, <b>and</b> he let a great part <b>of</b> his own former power pass <b>into</b> <b>it</b>, so that he could rule all <b>the</b> others. If he recovers <b>it</b>, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even <b>the</b> Three, <b>and</b> all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, <b>and</b> he will be stronger than ever.
<br>   “And this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that <b>the</b> One <b>had</b> perished; that <b>the</b> Elves <b>had</b> destroyed <b>it</b>, as should have been done. But he knows now that <b>it</b> has not perished, that <b>it</b> has been found. So he <b>is</b> seeking <b>it</b>, seeking <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> all his <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> bent <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. It <b>is</b> his great hope <b>and</b> our great fear.”
<br>   “Why, why wasn’t <b>it</b> destroyed?” cried Frodo. “And how did <b>the</b> Enemy ever come <b>to</b> lose <b>it</b>, if he <b>was</b> so strong, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so precious <b>to</b> him?” He clutched <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out <b>to</b> seize <b>it</b>.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> taken from him,” said Gandalf. “The strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>to</b> resist him <b>was</b> greater long ago; <b>and</b> not all Men were estranged from them. The Men <b>of</b> Westernesse came <b>to</b> their aid. That <b>is</b> a chapter <b>of</b> ancient history which <b>it</b> might be good <b>to</b> recall; for there <b>was</b> sorrow then too, <b>and</b> gathering dark, <b>but</b> great valour, <b>and</b> great deeds that were not wholly vain. One day, perhaps, <b>I</b> will tell you all <b>the</b> tale, <b>or</b> you shall hear <b>it</b> told <b>in</b> full <b>by</b> one who knows <b>it</b> best.
<br>   “But for <b>the</b> moment, since most <b>of</b> all you need <b>to</b> know how this thing came <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> that will be tale enough, this <b>is</b> all that <b>I</b> will say. It <b>was</b> Gil-galad, Elven-king <b>and</b> Elendil <b>of</b> Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deed; <b>and</b> Isildur Elendil’s son cut <b>the</b> Ring from Sauron’s hand <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> for his own. Then Sauron <b>was</b> vanquished <b>and</b> his spirit fled <b>and</b> <b>was</b> hidden for long years, until his shadow took shape again <b>in</b> Mirkwood.
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> lost. It fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great River, Anduin, <b>and</b> vanished. For Isildur <b>was</b> marching north along <b>the</b> east banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> Gladden Fields he <b>was</b> waylaid <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> almost all his folk were slain. He leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> waters, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Orcs saw him <b>and</b> killed him with arrows.”
<br>   Gandalf paused. “And there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark pools amid <b>the</b> Gladden Fields,” he said, “<b>the</b> Ring passed out <b>of</b> knowledge <b>and</b> legend; <b>and</b> even so much <b>of</b> its history <b>is</b> known now only <b>to</b> a few, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise could discover <b>no</b> more. But at last <b>I</b> can carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story, <b>I</b> think.
<br>   “Long after, <b>but</b> still <b>very</b> long ago, there lived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> Wilderland a clever-handed <b>and</b> quiet-footed little people. <b>I</b> guess they were <b>of</b> hobbit-kind; akin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stoors, for they loved <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> often swam <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> made little boats <b>of</b> reeds. There <b>was</b> among them a family <b>of</b> high repute, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> large <b>and</b> wealthier than most, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ruled <b>by</b> a grandmother <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk, stern <b>and</b> wise <b>in</b> old lore, such as they <b>had</b>. The most inquisitive <b>and</b> curious-minded <b>of</b> that family <b>was</b> called Sm?agol. He <b>was</b> interested <b>in</b> roots <b>and</b> beginnings; he dived <b>into</b> deep pools; he burrowed under trees <b>and</b> growing plants; he tunnelled <b>into</b> green mounds; <b>and</b> he ceased <b>to</b> look up at <b>the</b> hill-tops, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>on</b> trees, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> flowers opening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air: his head <b>and</b> his eyes were downward.
<br>   “He <b>had</b> a friend called D?agol, <b>of</b> similar sort, sharper-eyed <b>but</b> not so quick <b>and</b> strong. On a time they took a boat <b>and</b> went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields, where there were great beds <b>of</b> iris <b>and</b> flowering reeds. There Sm?agol got out <b>and</b> went nosing about <b>the</b> banks <b>but</b> D?agol sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat <b>and</b> fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, <b>and</b> before he knew where he <b>was</b>, he <b>was</b> dragged out <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. Then he let go <b>of</b> his line, for he <b>thought</b> he saw something shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river-bed; <b>and</b> holding his breath he grabbed at <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Then up he came spluttering, with weeds <b>in</b> his hair <b>and</b> a handful <b>of</b> mud; <b>and</b> he swam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. And behold! when he washed <b>the</b> mud away, there <b>in</b> his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> shone <b>and</b> glittered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun, so that his heart <b>was</b> glad. But Sm?agol <b>had</b> been watching him from behind a tree, <b>and</b> as D?agol gloated over <b>the</b> ring, Sm?agol came softly up behind.
<br>   ““Give us that, D?agol, my love,” said Sm?agol, over his friend’s shoulder.
<br>   ““Why?” said D?agol.
<br>   ““Because <b>it</b>’s my birthday, my love, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wants <b>it</b>,” said Sm?agol.
<br>   ““<b>I</b> don’t care,” said D?agol. “<b>I</b> have given you a present already, more than <b>I</b> could afford. <b>I</b> found this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>’m going <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b>.”
<br>   ““Oh, are you indeed, my love,” said Sm?agol; <b>and</b> he caught D?agol <b>by</b> <b>the</b> throat <b>and</b> strangled him, because <b>the</b> gold looked so bright <b>and</b> beautiful. Then he put <b>the</b> ring <b>on</b> his finger.
<br>   “No one ever found out <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become <b>of</b> D?agol; he <b>was</b> murdered far from home, <b>and</b> his body <b>was</b> cunningly hidden. But Sm?agol returned alone; <b>and</b> he found that none <b>of</b> his family could see him, when he <b>was</b> wearing <b>the</b> ring. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleased with his discovery <b>and</b> he concealed <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> he used <b>it</b> <b>to</b> find out secrets, <b>and</b> he put his knowledge <b>to</b> crooked <b>and</b> malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed <b>and</b> keen-eared for all that <b>was</b> hurtful. The ring <b>had</b> given him power according <b>to</b> his stature. It <b>is</b> not <b>to</b> be wondered at that he became <b>very</b> unpopular <b>and</b> <b>was</b> shunned (when visible) <b>by</b> all his relations. They kicked him, <b>and</b> he bit their feet. He took <b>to</b> thieving, <b>and</b> going about muttering <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> gurgling <b>in</b> his throat. So they called him Gollum, <b>and</b> cursed him, <b>and</b> told him <b>to</b> go far away; <b>and</b> his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from <b>the</b> family <b>and</b> turned him out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hole.
<br>   “He wandered <b>in</b> loneliness, weeping a little for <b>the</b> hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> he journeyed up <b>the</b> River, till he came <b>to</b> a stream that flowed down from <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> he went that way. He caught fish <b>in</b> deep pools with invisible fingers <b>and</b> ate them raw. One day <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> hot, <b>and</b> as he <b>was</b> bending over a pool, he felt a burning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> his head) <b>and</b> a dazzling light from <b>the</b> water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at <b>it</b>, for he <b>had</b> almost forgotten about <b>the</b> Sun. Then for <b>the</b> last time he looked up <b>and</b> shook his fist at <b>her</b>.
<br>   “But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, out <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> stream came. And he <b>thought</b> suddenly: “It would be cool <b>and</b> shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots <b>of</b> those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>.”
<br>   “So he journeyed <b>by</b> night up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> highlands, <b>and</b> he found a little cave out <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> dark stream ran; <b>and</b> he wormed his way like a maggot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> vanished out <b>of</b> all knowledge. The Ring went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows with him, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> maker, when his power <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> grow again, could learn <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Gollum!” cried Frodo. “Gollum? Do you mean that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a sad story,” said <b>the</b> wizard, “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> might have happened <b>to</b> others, even <b>to</b> some hobbits that <b>I</b> have known.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> can’t believe that Gollum <b>was</b> connected with hobbits, however distantly,” said Frodo with some heat. “What an abominable notion!”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> true all <b>the</b> same,” replied Gandalf. “About their origins, at any rate, <b>I</b> know more than hobbits <b>do</b> themselves. And even Bilbo’s story suggests <b>the</b> kinship. There <b>was</b> a great deal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background <b>of</b> their minds <b>and</b> memories that <b>was</b> <b>very</b> similar. They understood one another remarkably well, <b>very</b> much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a Dwarf, <b>or</b> an Orc, <b>or</b> even an Elf. Think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> riddles they both knew, for one thing.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo. “Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> much <b>the</b> same sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum meant <b>to</b> cheat all <b>the</b> time. He <b>was</b> just trying <b>to</b> put poor Bilbo off his guard. And <b>I</b> daresay <b>it</b> amused his wickedness <b>to</b> start a game which might end <b>in</b> providing him with an easy victim, <b>but</b> if he lost would not hurt him.”
<br>   “Only too true, <b>I</b> fear,” said Gandalf. “But there <b>was</b> something else <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> think, which you don’t see yet. Even Gollum <b>was</b> not wholly ruined. He <b>had</b> proved tougher than even one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit might. There <b>was</b> a little corner <b>of</b> his mind that <b>was</b> still his own, <b>and</b> light came through <b>it</b>, as through a chink <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark: light out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. It <b>was</b> actually pleasant, <b>I</b> think, <b>to</b> hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories <b>of</b> wind, <b>and</b> trees, <b>and</b> sun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> such forgotten things.
<br>   “But that, <b>of</b> course, would only make <b>the</b> evil part <b>of</b> him angrier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end—unless <b>it</b> could be conquered. Unless <b>it</b> could be cured.” Gandalf sighed. “Alas! there <b>is</b> little hope <b>of</b> that for him. Yet not <b>no</b> hope. No, not though he possessed <b>the</b> Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long since he <b>had</b> worn <b>it</b> much: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black darkness <b>it</b> <b>was</b> seldom needed. Certainly he <b>had</b> never “faded”. He <b>is</b> thin <b>and</b> tough still. But <b>the</b> thing <b>was</b> eating up his mind, <b>of</b> course, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> torment <b>had</b> become almost unbearable.
<br>   “All <b>the</b> “great secrets” under <b>the</b> mountains <b>had</b> turned out <b>to</b> be just empty night: there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> find out, <b>nothing</b> worth doing, only nasty furtive eating <b>and</b> resentful remembering. He <b>was</b> altogether wretched. He hated <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> he hated light more: he hated everything, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring most <b>of</b> all.”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” said Frodo. “Surely <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> his precious <b>and</b> <b>the</b> only thing he cared for? But if he hated <b>it</b>, why didn’t he <b>get</b> rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> go away <b>and</b> leave <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “You ought <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,” said Gandalf. “He hated <b>it</b> <b>and</b> loved <b>it</b>, as he hated <b>and</b> loved himself. He could not <b>get</b> rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. He <b>had</b> <b>no</b> will left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter.
<br>   “A Ring <b>of</b> Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off treacherously, <b>but</b> its keeper never abandons <b>it</b>. At most he plays with <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> handing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> someone else’s care—<b>and</b> that only at an early stage, when <b>it</b> first begins <b>to</b> grip. But as far as <b>I</b> know Bilbo alone <b>in</b> history has ever gone beyond playing, <b>and</b> really done <b>it</b>. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> cast <b>it</b> aside. It <b>was</b> not Gollum, Frodo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him.”
<br>   “What, just <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> meet Bilbo?” said Frodo. “Wouldn’t an Orc have suited <b>it</b> better?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> laughing matter,” said Gandalf. “Not for you. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> strangest event <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring so far: Bilbo’s arrival just at that time, <b>and</b> putting his hand <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, blindly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.
<br>   “There <b>was</b> more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> its master. It <b>had</b> slipped from Isildur’s hand <b>and</b> betrayed him; then when a chance came <b>it</b> caught poor D?agol, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> murdered; <b>and</b> after that Gollum, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> devoured him. It could make <b>no</b> further <b>use</b> <b>of</b> him: he <b>was</b> too small <b>and</b> mean; <b>and</b> as long as <b>it</b> stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master <b>was</b> awake <b>once</b> more <b>and</b> sending out his dark <b>thought</b> from Mirkwood, <b>it</b> abandoned Gollum. Only <b>to</b> be picked up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from <b>the</b> Shire!
<br>   “Behind that there <b>was</b> something else at work, beyond any design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring-maker. <b>I</b> can put <b>it</b> <b>no</b> plainer than <b>by</b> saying that Bilbo <b>was</b> meant <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> not <b>by</b> its maker. In which case you also were meant <b>to</b> have <b>it</b>. And that maybe an encouraging <b>thought</b>.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> not,” said Frodo. “Though <b>I</b> am not sure that <b>I</b> understand you. But how have you learned all this about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> about Gollum? Do you really know <b>it</b> all, <b>or</b> are you just guessing still?”
<br>   Gandalf looked at Frodo, <b>and</b> his eyes glinted. <b>I</b> knew much <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have learned much,” he answered. “But <b>I</b> am not going <b>to</b> give an account <b>of</b> all my doings <b>to</b> you. The history <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> Isildur <b>and</b> <b>the</b> One Ring <b>is</b> known <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> Wise. Your ring <b>is</b> shown <b>to</b> be that One Ring <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence.” “And when did you discover that?” asked Frodo, interrupting. “Just now <b>in</b> this room, <b>of</b> course,” answered <b>the</b> wizard sharply. “But <b>I</b> expected <b>to</b> find <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> have come back from dark journeys <b>and</b> long search <b>to</b> make that final test. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last proof, <b>and</b> all <b>is</b> now only too clear. Making out Gollum’s part, <b>and</b> fitting <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history, required some <b>thought</b>. <b>I</b> may have started with guesses about Gollum, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am not guessing now. <b>I</b> know. <b>I</b> have seen him.”
<br>   “You have seen Gollum?” exclaimed Frodo <b>in</b> amazement.
<br>   “Yes. The obvious thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, <b>of</b> course, if one could. <b>I</b> tried long ago; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have managed <b>it</b> at last.”
<br>   “Then <b>what</b> happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?”
<br>   “Not so clearly. What <b>I</b> have told you <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Gollum <b>was</b> willing <b>to</b> tell—though not, <b>of</b> course, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way <b>I</b> have reported <b>it</b>. Gollum <b>is</b> a liar, <b>and</b> you have <b>to</b> sift his words. For instance, he called <b>the</b> Ring his “birthday present”, <b>and</b> he stuck <b>to</b> that. He said <b>it</b> came from his grandmother, who <b>had</b> lots <b>of</b> beautiful things <b>of</b> that kind. A ridiculous story. <b>I</b> have <b>no</b> doubt that Sm?agol's grandmother <b>was</b> a matriarch, a great person <b>in</b> <b>her</b> way, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> <b>her</b> possessing many Elven-rings <b>was</b> absurd, <b>and</b> as for giving them away, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a lie. But a lie with a grain <b>of</b> truth.
<br>   “The murder <b>of</b> D?agol haunted Gollum, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> made up a defence, repeating <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his “precious” over <b>and</b> over again, as he gnawed bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, until he almost believed <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> his birthday. D?agol ought <b>to</b> have given <b>the</b> ring <b>to</b> him. It <b>had</b> previously turned up just so as <b>to</b> be a present. It <b>was</b> his birthday present, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>on</b>.
<br>   “<b>I</b> endured him as long as <b>I</b> could, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> truth <b>was</b> desperately important, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be harsh. <b>I</b> put <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> fire <b>on</b> him, <b>and</b> wrung <b>the</b> true story out <b>of</b> him, bit <b>by</b> bit, together with much snivelling <b>and</b> snarling. He <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> misunderstood <b>and</b> ill-used. But when he <b>had</b> at last told me his history, as far as <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddle-game <b>and</b> Bilbo’s escape, he would not say any more, except <b>in</b> dark hints. Some other fear <b>was</b> <b>on</b> him greater than mine. He muttered that he <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, <b>and</b> driven <b>into</b> a hole <b>and</b> then robbed. Gollum <b>had</b> good friends now, good friends <b>and</b> <b>very</b> strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for <b>it</b>. That <b>was</b> his chief <b>thought</b>. He hated Bilbo <b>and</b> cursed his name. What <b>is</b> more, he knew where he came from.”
<br>   “But how did he find that out?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Well, as for <b>the</b> name, Bilbo <b>very</b> foolishly told Gollum himself; <b>and</b> after that <b>it</b> would not be difficult <b>to</b> discover his country, <b>once</b> Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for <b>the</b> Ring proved stronger than his fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs, <b>or</b> even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light. After a year <b>or</b> two he left <b>the</b> mountains. You see, though still bound <b>by</b> desire <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer devouring him; he began <b>to</b> revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> mortally hungry.
<br>   “Light, light <b>of</b> Sun <b>and</b> Moon, he still feared <b>and</b> hated, <b>and</b> he always will, <b>I</b> think; <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> cunning. He found he could hide from daylight <b>and</b> moonshine, <b>and</b> make his way swiftly <b>and</b> softly <b>by</b> dead <b>of</b> night with his pale cold eyes, <b>and</b> catch small frightened <b>or</b> unwary things. He grew stronger <b>and</b> bolder with new food <b>and</b> new air. He found his way <b>into</b> Mirkwood, as one would expect.”
<br>   “Is that where you found him?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> saw him there,” answered Gandalf, “<b>but</b> before that he <b>had</b> wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It <b>was</b> difficult <b>to</b> learn anything from him for certain, for his talk <b>was</b> constantly interrupted <b>by</b> curses <b>and</b> threats. “What <b>had</b> <b>it</b> got <b>in</b> its pocketses?” he said. “It wouldn’t say, <b>no</b> precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, <b>it</b> did. It broke <b>the</b> rules. We ought <b>to</b> have squeezed <b>it</b>, yes precious. And we will, precious!”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> a sample <b>of</b> his talk. <b>I</b> don’t suppose you want any more. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> weary days <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But from hints dropped among <b>the</b> snarls <b>I</b> even gathered that his padding feet <b>had</b> taken him at last <b>to</b> Esgaroth, <b>and</b> even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> streets <b>of</b> Dale, listening secretly <b>and</b> peering. Well, <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great events went far <b>and</b> wide <b>in</b> Wilderland, <b>and</b> many <b>had</b> heard Bilbo’s name <b>and</b> knew where he came from. We <b>had</b> made <b>no</b> secret <b>of</b> our return journey <b>to</b> his home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn <b>what</b> he wanted.”
<br>   “Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?” asked Frodo. “Why didn’t he come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “Ah,” said Gandalf, “now we come <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> think Gollum tried <b>to</b>. He set out <b>and</b> came back westward, as far as <b>the</b> Great River. But then he turned aside. He <b>was</b> not daunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>I</b> am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.
<br>   “The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail <b>was</b> still fresh then. Through Mirkwood <b>and</b> back again <b>it</b> led them, though they never caught him. The wood <b>was</b> full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rumour <b>of</b> him, dreadful tales even among beasts <b>and</b> birds. The Woodmen said that there <b>was</b> some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees <b>to</b> find nests; <b>it</b> crept <b>into</b> holes <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> young; <b>it</b> slipped through windows <b>to</b> find cradles.
<br>   “But at <b>the</b> western edge <b>of</b> Mirkwood <b>the</b> trail turned away. It wandered off southwards <b>and</b> passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wood-elves” ken, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> lost. And then <b>I</b> made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, <b>and</b> not <b>the</b> first; though <b>I</b> fear <b>it</b> may prove <b>the</b> worst. <b>I</b> let <b>the</b> matter be. <b>I</b> let him go; for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> much else <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> at that time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still trusted <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> Saruman.
<br>   “Well, that <b>was</b> years ago. <b>I</b> have paid for <b>it</b> since with many dark <b>and</b> dangerous days. The trail <b>was</b> long cold when <b>I</b> took <b>it</b> up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been <b>in</b> vain, <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> help that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> from a friend: Aragorn, <b>the</b> greatest traveller <b>and</b> huntsman <b>of</b> this age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Together we sought for Gollum down <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> Wilderland, <b>without</b> hope, <b>and</b> <b>without</b> success. But at last, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> given up <b>the</b> chase <b>and</b> turned <b>to</b> other parts, Gollum <b>was</b> found. My friend returned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great perils bringing <b>the</b> miserable creature with him.
<br>   “What he <b>had</b> been doing he would not say. He only wept <b>and</b> called us cruel, with many a gollum <b>in</b> his throat; <b>and</b> when we pressed him he whined <b>and</b> cringed, <b>and</b> rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But <b>I</b> am afraid there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> possible doubt: he <b>had</b> made his slow, sneaking way, step <b>by</b> step, mile <b>by</b> mile, south, down at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor.”
<br>   A heavy silence fell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound <b>of</b> Sam’s shears could now be heard.
<br>   “Yes, <b>to</b> Mordor,” said Gandalf. “Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dark Power <b>was</b> bending all its will <b>to</b> gather them there. The Ring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> summons. And all folk were whispering then <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Shadow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> its hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him <b>in</b> his revenge!
<br>   “Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner <b>or</b> later as he lurked <b>and</b> pried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders he would be caught, <b>and</b> taken—for examination. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> fear. When he <b>was</b> found he <b>had</b> already been there long, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> his way back. On some errand <b>of</b> mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief <b>was</b> done.
<br>   “Yes, alas! through him <b>the</b> Enemy has learned that <b>the</b> One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his ring. He knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a Great Ring, for <b>it</b> gave long life. He knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three, for they have never been lost, <b>and</b> they endure <b>no</b> evil. He knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seven, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Nine, for they are accounted for. He knows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> One. And he has at last heard, <b>I</b> think, <b>of</b> hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   “The Shire—he may be seeking for <b>it</b> now, if he has not already found out where <b>it</b> lies. Indeed, Frodo, <b>I</b> fear that he may even think that <b>the</b> long-unnoticed name <b>of</b> Baggins has become important.”
<br>   “But this <b>is</b> terrible!” cried Frodo. “Far worse than <b>the</b> worst that <b>I</b> imagined from your hints <b>and</b> warnings. O Gandalf, best <b>of</b> friends, <b>what</b> am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>? For now <b>I</b> am really afraid. What am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature, when he <b>had</b> a chance!”
<br>   “Pity? It <b>was</b> Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, <b>and</b> Mercy: not <b>to</b> strike <b>without</b> need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so little hurt from <b>the</b> evil, <b>and</b> escaped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, because he began his ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring so. With Pity.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sorry,” said Frodo. “But <b>I</b> am frightened; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel any pity for Gollum.”
<br>   “You have not seen him,” Gandalf broke <b>in</b>.
<br>   “No, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t want <b>to</b>,” said Frodo. <b>I</b> can’t understand you. Do you mean <b>to</b> say that you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves, have let him live <b>on</b> after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he <b>is</b> as bad as an Orc, <b>and</b> just an enemy. He deserves death.”
<br>   “Deserves <b>it</b>! <b>I</b> daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them? Then <b>do</b> not be too eager <b>to</b> deal out death <b>in</b> judgement. For even <b>the</b> <b>very</b> wise cannot see all ends. <b>I</b> have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> a chance <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. And he <b>is</b> bound up with <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part <b>to</b> play yet, for good <b>or</b> ill, before <b>the</b> end; <b>and</b> when that comes, <b>the</b> pity <b>of</b> Bilbo may rule <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> many—yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he <b>is</b> <b>very</b> old <b>and</b> <b>very</b> wretched. The Wood-elves have him <b>in</b> prison, <b>but</b> they treat him with such kindness as they can find <b>in</b> their wise hearts.”
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same,” said Frodo, “even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, <b>I</b> wish he <b>had</b> not kept <b>the</b> Ring. <b>I</b> wish he <b>had</b> never found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not got <b>it</b>! Why did you let me keep <b>it</b>? Why didn’t you make me throw <b>it</b> away, <b>or</b>, <b>or</b> destroy <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “Let you? Make you?” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Haven’t you been listening <b>to</b> all that <b>I</b> have said? You are not thinking <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you are saying. But as for throwing <b>it</b> away, that <b>was</b> obviously wrong. These Rings have a way <b>of</b> being found. In evil hands <b>it</b> might have done great evil. Worst <b>of</b> all, <b>it</b> might have fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Indeed <b>it</b> certainly would; for this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> he <b>is</b> exerting all his power <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> <b>or</b> draw <b>it</b> <b>to</b> himself.
<br>   “Of course, my dear Frodo, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dangerous for you; <b>and</b> that has troubled me deeply. But there <b>was</b> so much at stake that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> take some risk—though even when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> far away there has never been a day when <b>the</b> Shire has not been guarded <b>by</b> watchful eyes. As long as you never used <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> did not think that <b>the</b> Ring would have any lasting effect <b>on</b> you, not for evil, not at any rate for a <b>very</b> long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when <b>I</b> last saw you, <b>I</b> still knew little for certain.”
<br>   “But why not destroy <b>it</b>, as you say should have been done long ago?” cried Frodo again. If you <b>had</b> warned me, <b>or</b> even sent me a message, <b>I</b> would have done away with <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Would you? How would you <b>do</b> that? Have you ever tried?”
<br>   “No. But <b>I</b> suppose one could hammer <b>it</b> <b>or</b> melt <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Try!” said Gandalf. Try now!”
<br>   Frodo drew <b>the</b> Ring out <b>of</b> his pocket again <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b>. It now appeared plain <b>and</b> smooth, <b>without</b> mark <b>or</b> device that he could see. The gold looked <b>very</b> fair <b>and</b> pure, <b>and</b> Frodo <b>thought</b> how rich <b>and</b> beautiful <b>was</b> its colour, how perfect <b>was</b> its roundness. It <b>was</b> an admirable thing <b>and</b> altogether precious. When he took <b>it</b> out he <b>had</b> intended <b>to</b> fling <b>it</b> from him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> hottest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. But he found now that he could not <b>do</b> so, not <b>without</b> a great struggle. He weighed <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> his hand, hesitating, <b>and</b> forcing himself <b>to</b> remember all that Gandalf <b>had</b> told him; <b>and</b> then with an effort <b>of</b> will he made a movement, as if <b>to</b> cast <b>it</b> away—<b>but</b> he found that he <b>had</b> put <b>it</b> back <b>in</b> his pocket.
<br>   Gandalf laughed grimly. “You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let <b>it</b> go, nor will <b>to</b> damage <b>it</b>. And <b>I</b> could not “make” you—except <b>by</b> force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking <b>the</b> Ring, force <b>is</b> useless. Even if you took <b>it</b> <b>and</b> struck <b>it</b> with a heavy sledge-hammer, <b>it</b> would make <b>no</b> dint <b>in</b> <b>it</b>. It cannot be unmade <b>by</b> your hands, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> mine.
<br>   “Your small fire, <b>of</b> course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed through <b>it</b> unscathed, <b>and</b> even unheated. But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> smith’s forge <b>in</b> this Shire that could change <b>it</b> at all. Not even <b>the</b> anvils <b>and</b> furnaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves could <b>do</b> that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt <b>and</b> consume <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> not now any dragon left <b>on</b> earth <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> old fire <b>is</b> hot enough; nor <b>was</b> there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon <b>the</b> Black, who could have harmed <b>the</b> One Ring, <b>the</b> Ruling Ring, for that <b>was</b> made <b>by</b> Sauron himself. There <b>is</b> only one way: <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths <b>of</b> Orodruin, <b>the</b> Fire-mountain, <b>and</b> cast <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> there, if you really wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> beyond <b>the</b> grasp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy for ever.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> really wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>!” cried Frodo. “Or, well, <b>to</b> have <b>it</b> destroyed. <b>I</b> am not made for perilous quests. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen <b>the</b> Ring! Why did <b>it</b> come <b>to</b> me? Why <b>was</b> <b>I</b> chosen?”
<br>   “Such questions cannot be answered,” said Gandalf. “You may be sure that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not for any merit that others <b>do</b> not possess: not for power <b>or</b> wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, <b>and</b> you must therefore <b>use</b> such strength <b>and</b> heart <b>and</b> wits as you have.”
<br>   “But <b>I</b> have so little <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> these things! You are wise <b>and</b> powerful. Will you not take <b>the</b> Ring?”
<br>   “No!” cried Gandalf, springing <b>to</b> his feet. “With that power <b>I</b> should have power too great <b>and</b> terrible. And over me <b>the</b> Ring would gain a power still greater <b>and</b> more deadly.” His eyes flashed <b>and</b> his face <b>was</b> lit as <b>by</b> a fire within. “Do not tempt me! For <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> become like <b>the</b> Dark Lord himself. Yet <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> my heart <b>is</b> <b>by</b> pity, pity for weakness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> desire <b>of</b> strength <b>to</b> <b>do</b> good. Do not tempt me! <b>I</b> dare not take <b>it</b>, not even <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> safe, unused. The wish <b>to</b> wield <b>it</b> would be too great, for my strength. <b>I</b> shall have such need <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Great perils lie before me.”
<br>   He went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> drew aside <b>the</b> curtains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shutters. Sunlight streamed back again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room. Sam passed along <b>the</b> path outside whistling. “And now,” said <b>the</b> wizard, turning back <b>to</b> Frodo, “<b>the</b> decision lies with you. But <b>I</b> will always help you.” He laid his hand <b>on</b> Frodo’s shoulder. “<b>I</b> will help you bear this burden, as long as It <b>is</b> yours <b>to</b> bear. But we must <b>do</b> something, soon. The Enemy <b>is</b> moving.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a long silence. Gandalf sat down again <b>and</b> puffed at his pipe, as if lost <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>. His eyes seemed closed, <b>but</b> under <b>the</b> lids he <b>was</b> watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at <b>the</b> red embers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, until they filled all his vision, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> be looking down <b>into</b> profound wells <b>of</b> fire. He <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fabled Cracks <b>of</b> Doom <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fiery Mountain.
<br>   “Well!” said Gandalf at last. “What are you thinking about? Have you decided <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>?”
<br>   “No!” answered Frodo, coming back <b>to</b> himself out <b>of</b> darkness, <b>and</b> finding <b>to</b> his surprise that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not dark, <b>and</b> that out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window he could see <b>the</b> sunlit garden. “Or perhaps, yes. As far as <b>I</b> understand <b>what</b> you have said, <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> must keep <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> guard <b>it</b>, at least for <b>the</b> present, whatever <b>it</b> may <b>do</b> <b>to</b> me.”
<br>   “Whatever <b>it</b> may <b>do</b>, <b>it</b> will be slow, slow <b>to</b> evil, if you keep <b>it</b> with that purpose,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope so,” said Frodo. “But <b>I</b> hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meanwhile <b>it</b> seems that <b>I</b> am a danger, a danger <b>to</b> all that live near me. <b>I</b> cannot keep <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> stay here. <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> leave Bag End, leave <b>the</b> Shire, leave everything <b>and</b> go away.” He sighed.
<br>   “<b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> save <b>the</b> Shire, if <b>I</b> could—though there have been times when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants too stupid <b>and</b> dull for words, <b>and</b> have felt that an earthquake <b>or</b> an invasion <b>of</b> dragons might be good for them. But <b>I</b> don’t feel like that now. <b>I</b> feel that as long as <b>the</b> Shire lies behind, safe <b>and</b> comfortable, <b>I</b> shall find wandering more bearable: <b>I</b> shall know that somewhere there <b>is</b> a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.
<br>   “Of course, <b>I</b> have sometimes <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going away, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> imagined that as a kind <b>of</b> holiday, a series <b>of</b> adventures like Bilbo’s <b>or</b> better, ending <b>in</b> peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger <b>into</b> danger, drawing <b>it</b> after me. And <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> must go alone, if <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that <b>and</b> save <b>the</b> Shire. But <b>I</b> feel <b>very</b> small, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> uprooted, <b>and</b> well—desperate. The Enemy <b>is</b> so strong <b>and</b> terrible.”
<br>   He did not tell Gandalf, <b>but</b> as he <b>was</b> speaking a great desire <b>to</b> follow Bilbo flamed up <b>in</b> his heart—<b>to</b> follow Bilbo, <b>and</b> even perhaps <b>to</b> find him again. It <b>was</b> so strong that <b>it</b> overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there <b>and</b> then down <b>the</b> road <b>without</b> his hat, as Bilbo <b>had</b> done <b>on</b> a similar morning long ago.
<br>   “My dear Frodo!” exclaimed Gandalf. “Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as <b>I</b> have said before. You can learn all that there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about their ways <b>in</b> a month, <b>and</b> yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch. <b>I</b> hardly expected <b>to</b> <b>get</b> such an answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made <b>no</b> mistake <b>in</b> choosing his heir, though he little <b>thought</b> how important <b>it</b> would prove. <b>I</b> am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able <b>to</b> stay hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire much longer; <b>and</b> for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe <b>to</b> have, outside <b>the</b> Shire <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild. <b>I</b> will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.
<br>   “But <b>I</b> don’t think you need go alone. Not if you know <b>of</b> anyone you can trust, <b>and</b> who would be willing <b>to</b> go <b>by</b> your side—<b>and</b> that you would be willing <b>to</b> take <b>into</b> unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be careful <b>in</b> choosing! And be careful <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you say, even <b>to</b> your closest friends! The enemy has many spies <b>and</b> many ways <b>of</b> hearing.”
<br>   Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all <b>was</b> <b>very</b> quiet, inside <b>and</b> outside. Gandalf crept <b>to</b> one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window. Then with a dart he sprang <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sill, <b>and</b> thrust a long arm out <b>and</b> downwards. There <b>was</b> a squawk, <b>and</b> up came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled <b>by</b> one ear.
<br>   “Well, well, bless my beard!” said Gandalf. “Sam Gamgee <b>is</b> <b>it</b>? Now <b>what</b> may you be doing?”
<br>   “Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!” said Sam. “Nothing! Leastways <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just trimming <b>the</b> grass-border under <b>the</b> window, if you follow me.” He picked up his shears <b>and</b> exhibited them as evidence.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t,” said Gandalf grimly. It <b>is</b> some time since <b>I</b> last heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?”
<br>   “Eavesdropping, sir? <b>I</b> don’t follow you, begging your pardon. There ain’t <b>no</b> eaves at Bag End, <b>and</b> that’s a fact.”
<br>   “Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, <b>and</b> why did you listen?” Gandalf’s eyes flashed <b>and</b> his brows stuck out like bristles.
<br>   “Mr. Frodo, sir!” cried Sam quaking. “Don’t let him hurt me, sir! Don’t let him turn me <b>into</b> anything unnatural! My old dad would take <b>on</b> so. <b>I</b> meant <b>no</b> harm, <b>on</b> my honour, sir!”
<br>   “He won’t hurt you,” said Frodo, hardly able <b>to</b> keep from laughing, although he <b>was</b> himself startled <b>and</b> rather puzzled. “He knows, as well as <b>I</b> <b>do</b>, that you mean <b>no</b> harm. But just you up <b>and</b> answer his questions straight away!”
<br>   “Well, sir,” said Sam dithering a little. “<b>I</b> heard a deal that <b>I</b> didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, <b>and</b> rings, <b>and</b> Mr. Bilbo, sir, <b>and</b> dragons, <b>and</b> a fiery mountain, <b>and</b>—<b>and</b> Elves, sir. <b>I</b> listened because <b>I</b> couldn’t help myself, if you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. Lor bless me, sir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love tales <b>of</b> that sort. And <b>I</b> believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves, sir! <b>I</b> would dearly love <b>to</b> see them. Couldn’t you take me <b>to</b> see Elves, sir, when you go?”
<br>   Suddenly Gandalf laughed. “Come inside!” he shouted, <b>and</b> putting out both his arms he lifted <b>the</b> astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings <b>and</b> all, right through <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> stood him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. “Take you <b>to</b> see Elves, eh?” he said, eyeing Sam closely, <b>but</b> with a smile flickering <b>on</b> his face. “So you heard that Mr. Frodo <b>is</b> going away?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> did, sir. And that’s why <b>I</b> choked: which you heard seemingly. <b>I</b> tried not <b>to</b>, sir, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> burst out <b>of</b> me: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so upset.”
<br>   “It can’t be helped, Sam,” said Frodo sadly. He <b>had</b> suddenly realized that flying from <b>the</b> Shire would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> familiar comforts <b>of</b> Bag End. “<b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> go. But”—<b>and</b> here he looked hard at Sam—“if you really care about me, you will keep that dead secret. See? If you don’t, if you even breathe a word <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you’ve heard here, then <b>I</b> hope Gandalf will turn you <b>into</b> a spotted toad <b>and</b> fill <b>the</b> garden full <b>of</b> grass-snakes.”
<br>   Sam fell <b>on</b> his knees, trembling. “Get up, Sam!” said Gandalf. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> something better than that. Something <b>to</b> shut your mouth, <b>and</b> punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!”
<br>   “Me, sir!” cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. “Me go <b>and</b> see Elves <b>and</b> all! Hooray!” he shouted, <b>and</b> then burst <b>into</b> tears.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 3
<br>THREE IS COMPANY
<br>
<br>   “You ought <b>to</b> go quietly, <b>and</b> you ought <b>to</b> go soon,” said Gandalf. Two <b>or</b> three weeks <b>had</b> passed, <b>and</b> still Frodo made <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> getting ready <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “<b>I</b> know. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult <b>to</b> <b>do</b> both,” he objected. If <b>I</b> just vanish like Bilbo, <b>the</b> tale will be all over <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> <b>no</b> time.”
<br>   “Of course you mustn’t vanish!” said Gandalf. “That wouldn’t <b>do</b> at all! <b>I</b> said soon, not instantly. If you can think <b>of</b> any way <b>of</b> slipping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>without</b> its being generally known, <b>it</b> will be worth a little delay. But you must not delay too long.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> autumn, <b>on</b> <b>or</b> after Our Birthday?” asked Frodo. “<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> could probably make some arrangements <b>by</b> then.”
<br>   To tell <b>the</b> truth, he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> reluctant <b>to</b> start, now that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> for years, <b>and</b> he wanted <b>to</b> savour as much as he could <b>of</b> his last summer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least <b>of</b> his heart would think more kindly <b>of</b> journeying, as <b>it</b> always did at that season. He <b>had</b> indeed privately made up his mind <b>to</b> leave <b>on</b> his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred <b>and</b> twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow <b>the</b> proper day <b>on</b> which <b>to</b> set out <b>and</b> follow him. Following Bilbo <b>was</b> uppermost <b>in</b> his mind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> one thing that made <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> leaving bearable. He <b>thought</b> as little as possible about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> where <b>it</b> might lead him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end. But he did not tell all his thoughts <b>to</b> Gandalf. What <b>the</b> wizard guessed <b>was</b> always difficult <b>to</b> tell.
<br>   He looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled. “Very well,” he said. “<b>I</b> think that will <b>do</b>—<b>but</b> <b>it</b> must not be any later. <b>I</b> am getting <b>very</b> anxious. In <b>the</b> mean-while, <b>do</b> take care, <b>and</b> don’t let out any hint <b>of</b> where you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, <b>I</b> really shall turn him <b>into</b> a toad.”
<br>   “As for where <b>I</b> am going,” said Frodo, “<b>it</b> would be difficult <b>to</b> give that away, for <b>I</b> have <b>no</b> clear idea myself, yet.”
<br>   “Don’t be absurd!” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> am not warning you against leaving an address at <b>the</b> post-office! But you are leaving <b>the</b> Shire—<b>and</b> that should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, <b>or</b> at least set out, either North, South, West <b>or</b> East—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> direction should certainly not be known.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have been so taken up with <b>the</b> thoughts <b>of</b> leaving Bag End, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> saying farewell, that <b>I</b> have never even considered <b>the</b> direction,” said Frodo. “For where am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> go? And <b>by</b> <b>what</b> shall <b>I</b> steer? What <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be my quest? Bilbo went <b>to</b> find a treasure, there <b>and</b> back again; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> go <b>to</b> lose one, <b>and</b> not return, as far as <b>I</b> can see.”
<br>   “But you cannot see <b>very</b> far,” said Gandalf. “Neither can <b>I</b>. It may be your task <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom; <b>but</b> that quest may be for others: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.”
<br>   “No indeed!” said Frodo. “But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime <b>what</b> course am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> lake?”
<br>   “Towards danger; <b>but</b> not too rashly, nor too straight,” answered <b>the</b> wizard. “If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not prove too perilous, though <b>the</b> Road <b>is</b> less easy than <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will grow worse as <b>the</b> year fails.”
<br>   “Rivendell!” said Frodo. “Very good: <b>I</b> will go east, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will make for Rivendell. <b>I</b> will take Sam <b>to</b> visit <b>the</b> Elves; he will be delighted.” He spoke lightly; <b>but</b> his heart <b>was</b> moved suddenly with a desire <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond Halfelven, <b>and</b> breathe <b>the</b> air <b>of</b> that deep valley where many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fair Folk still dwelt <b>in</b> peace.
<br>   One summer’s evening an astonishing piece <b>of</b> news reached <b>the</b> Ivy Bush <b>and</b> Green Dragon. Giants <b>and</b> other portents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo <b>was</b> selling Bag End, indeed he <b>had</b> already sold <b>it</b>—<b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses!
<br>   “For a nice bit, loo,” said some. “At a bargain price,” said others, “<b>and</b> that’s more likely when Mistress Lobelia’s <b>the</b> buyer.” (Otho <b>had</b> died some years before, at <b>the</b> ripe <b>but</b> disappointed age <b>of</b> 102.)
<br>   Just why Mr. Frodo <b>was</b> selling his beautiful hole <b>was</b> even more debatable than <b>the</b> price. A few held <b>the</b> theory—supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> nods <b>and</b> hints <b>of</b> Mr. Baggins himself—that Frodo’s money <b>was</b> running out: he <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> leave Hobbiton <b>and</b> live <b>in</b> a quiet way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proceeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sale down <b>in</b> Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. “As far from <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses as may be,” some added. But so firmly fixed <b>had</b> <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immeasurable wealth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bagginses <b>of</b> Bag End become that most found this hard <b>to</b> believe, harder than any other reason <b>or</b> unreason that their fancy could suggest: <b>to</b> most <b>it</b> suggested a dark <b>and</b> yet unrevealed plot <b>by</b> Gandalf. Though he kept himself <b>very</b> quiet <b>and</b> did not go about <b>by</b> day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well known that he <b>was</b> “hiding up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bag End”. But however a removal might fit <b>in</b> with <b>the</b> designs <b>of</b> his wizardry, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> doubt about <b>the</b> fact: Frodo Baggins <b>was</b> going back <b>to</b> Buckland.
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> shall be moving this autumn,” he said. “Merry Brandybuck <b>is</b> looking out for a nice little hole for me, <b>or</b> perhaps a small house.”
<br>   As a matter <b>of</b> fact with Merry’s help he <b>had</b> already chosen <b>and</b> bought a little house at Crickhollow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country beyond Bucklebury. To all <b>but</b> Sam he pretended he <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> settle down there permanently. The decision <b>to</b> set out eastwards <b>had</b> suggested <b>the</b> idea <b>to</b> him; for Buckland <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> as he <b>had</b> lived there <b>in</b> childhood his going back would at least seem credible.
<br>   Gandalf stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> June, soon after Frodo’s plan <b>had</b> been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he <b>was</b> going off again next morning. “Only for a short while, <b>I</b> hope,” he said. “But <b>I</b> am going down beyond <b>the</b> southern borders <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some news, if <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b> have been idle longer than <b>I</b> should.”
<br>   He spoke lightly, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that he looked rather worried. “Has anything happened?” he asked.
<br>   “Well <b>no</b>; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have heard something that has made me anxious <b>and</b> needs looking <b>into</b>. If <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> necessary after all for you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off at <b>once</b>, <b>I</b> shall come back immediately, <b>or</b> at least send word. In <b>the</b> meanwhile stick <b>to</b> your plan; <b>but</b> be more careful than ever, especially <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. Let me impress <b>on</b> you <b>once</b> more: don’t <b>use</b> <b>it</b>!”
<br>   He went off at dawn. “<b>I</b> may be back any day,” he said. “At <b>the</b> <b>very</b> latest <b>I</b> shall come back for <b>the</b> farewell party. <b>I</b> think after all you may need my company <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   At first Frodo <b>was</b> a good deal disturbed, <b>and</b> wondered often <b>what</b> Gandalf could have heard; <b>but</b> his uneasiness wore off, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire <b>had</b> seldom seen so fair a summer, <b>or</b> so rich an autumn: <b>the</b> trees were laden with apples, honey <b>was</b> dripping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> combs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> corn <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> full.
<br>   Autumn <b>was</b> well under way before Frodo began <b>to</b> worry about Gandalf again. September <b>was</b> passing <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> still <b>no</b> news <b>of</b> him. The Birthday, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> removal, drew nearer, <b>and</b> still he did not come, <b>or</b> send word. Bag End began <b>to</b> be busy. Some <b>of</b> Frodo’s friends came <b>to</b> stay <b>and</b> help him with <b>the</b> packing: there <b>was</b> Fredegar Bolger <b>and</b> Folco Boffin, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> course his special friends Pippin Took <b>and</b> Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned <b>the</b> whole place upside-down.
<br>   On September 20th two covered carts went off laden <b>to</b> Buckland, conveying <b>the</b> furniture <b>and</b> goods that Frodo <b>had</b> not sold <b>to</b> his new home, <b>by</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious, <b>and</b> kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair <b>and</b> clear as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> long ago for Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In <b>the</b> evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite small, just a dinner for himself <b>and</b> his four helpers; <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> troubled <b>and</b> fell <b>in</b> <b>no</b> mood for <b>it</b>. The <b>thought</b> that he would so soon have <b>to</b> part with his young friends weighed <b>on</b> his heart. He wondered how he would break <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them.
<br>   The four younger hobbits were, however, <b>in</b> high spirits, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party soon became <b>very</b> cheerful <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> Gandalf’s absence. The dining-room <b>was</b> bare except for a table <b>and</b> chairs, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> food <b>was</b> good, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> good wine: Frodo’s wine <b>had</b> not been included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sale <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses.
<br>   “Whatever happens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> my stuff, when <b>the</b> S.-B.s <b>get</b> their claws <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, at any rate <b>I</b> have found a good home for this!” said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last drop <b>of</b> Old Winyards.
<br>   When they <b>had</b> sung many songs, <b>and</b> talked <b>of</b> many things they <b>had</b> done together, they toasted Bilbo’s birthday, <b>and</b> they drank his health <b>and</b> Frodo’s together according <b>to</b> Frodo’s custom. Then they went out for a sniff <b>of</b> air, <b>and</b> glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, <b>and</b> then they went <b>to</b> bed. Frodo’s party <b>was</b> over, <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>had</b> not come.
<br>   The next morning they were busy packing another cart with <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luggage. Merry took charge <b>of</b> this, <b>and</b> drove off with Fatty (that <b>is</b> Fredegar Bolger). “Someone must <b>get</b> there <b>and</b> warm <b>the</b> house before you arrive,” said Merry. “Well, see you later—<b>the</b> day after tomorrow, if you don’t go <b>to</b> sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way!”
<br>   Folco went home after lunch, <b>but</b> Pippin remained behind. Frodo <b>was</b> restless <b>and</b> anxious, listening <b>in</b> vain for a sound <b>of</b> Gandalf. He decided <b>to</b> wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go <b>to</b> Crickhollow, <b>and</b> might even <b>get</b> there first. For Frodo <b>was</b> going <b>on</b> foot. His plan—for pleasure <b>and</b> a last look at <b>the</b> Shire as much as any other reason—<b>was</b> <b>to</b> walk from Hobbiton <b>to</b> Bucklebury Ferry, taking <b>it</b> fairly easy.
<br>   “<b>I</b> shall <b>get</b> myself a bit <b>into</b> training, too,” he said, looking at himself <b>in</b> a dusty mirror <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-empty hall. He <b>had</b> not done any strenuous walking for a long time, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reflection looked rather flabby, he <b>thought</b>.
<br>   After lunch, <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much <b>to</b> Frodo’s annoyance. “Ours at last!” said Lobelia, as <b>she</b> stepped inside. It <b>was</b> not polite; nor strictly true, for <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been obliged <b>to</b> wait about seventy-seven years longer for Bag End than <b>she</b> <b>once</b> hoped, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now a hundred years old. Anyway, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> see that <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> paid for <b>had</b> been carried off; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> wanted <b>the</b> keys. It took a long while <b>to</b> satisfy <b>her</b>, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought a complete inventory with <b>her</b> <b>and</b> went right through <b>it</b>. In <b>the</b> end <b>she</b> departed with Lotho <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spare key <b>and</b> <b>the</b> promise that <b>the</b> other key would be left at <b>the</b> Gamgees” <b>in</b> Bagshot Row. She snorted, <b>and</b> showed plainly that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Gamgees capable <b>of</b> plundering <b>the</b> hole during <b>the</b> night. Frodo did not offer <b>her</b> any tea.
<br>   He took his own tea with Pippin <b>and</b> Sam Gamgee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen. It <b>had</b> been officially announced that Sam <b>was</b> coming <b>to</b> Buckland “<b>to</b> <b>do</b> for Mr. Frodo <b>and</b> look after his bit <b>of</b> garden”; an arrangement that <b>was</b> approved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer, though <b>it</b> did not console him for <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> <b>having</b> Lobelia as a neighbour.
<br>   “Our last meal at Bag End!” said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left <b>the</b> washing up for Lobelia. Pippin <b>and</b> Sam strapped up their three packs <b>and</b> piled them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden. Sam disappeared.
<br>   The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad <b>and</b> gloomy <b>and</b> dishevelled. Frodo wandered round <b>the</b> familiar rooms, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunset fade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> shadows creep out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out <b>and</b> walked down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> a short way down <b>the</b> Hill Road. He half expected <b>to</b> see Gandalf come striding up through <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   The sky <b>was</b> clear <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars were growing bright. “It’s going <b>to</b> be a fine night,” he said aloud. “That’s good for a <b>beginning</b>. <b>I</b> feel like walking. <b>I</b> can’t bear any more hanging about. <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> start, <b>and</b> Gandalf must follow me.” He turned <b>to</b> go back, <b>and</b> then slopped, for he heard voices, just round <b>the</b> corner <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Bagshot Row. One voice <b>was</b> certainly <b>the</b> old Gaffer’s; <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> strange, <b>and</b> somehow unpleasant. He could not make out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> said, <b>but</b> he heard <b>the</b> Gaffer’s answers, which were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.
<br>   “No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, <b>and</b> my Sam went with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out <b>and</b> gone, <b>I</b> tell’ee. Why? Why’s none <b>of</b> my business, <b>or</b> yours. Where <b>to</b>? That ain’t <b>no</b> secret. He’s moved <b>to</b> Bucklebury <b>or</b> some such place, away down yonder. Yes <b>it</b> <b>is</b>—a tidy way. <b>I</b>’ve never been so far myself; they’re queer folks <b>in</b> Buckland. No, <b>I</b> can’t give <b>no</b> message. Good night <b>to</b> you!”
<br>   Footsteps went away down <b>the</b> Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why <b>the</b> fact that they did not come <b>on</b> up <b>the</b> Hill seemed a great relief. “<b>I</b> am sick <b>of</b> questions <b>and</b> curiosity about my doings, <b>I</b> suppose,” he <b>thought</b>. “What an inquisitive lot they all are!” He <b>had</b> half a mind <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> ask <b>the</b> Gaffer who <b>the</b> inquirer <b>was</b>; <b>but</b> he <b>thought</b> better (<b>or</b> worse) <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> turned <b>and</b> walked quickly back <b>to</b> Bag End.
<br>   Pippin <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his pack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> porch. Sam <b>was</b> not there. Frodo stepped inside <b>the</b> dark door. “Sam!” he called. “Sam! Time!”
<br>   “Coming, sir!” came <b>the</b> answer from far within, followed soon <b>by</b> Sam himself, wiping his mouth. He <b>had</b> been saying farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beer-barrel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cellar.
<br>   “All aboard, Sam?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Yes, sir. <b>I</b>’ll last for a bit now, sir.”
<br>   Frodo shut <b>and</b> locked <b>the</b> round door, <b>and</b> gave <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> Sam. “Run down with this <b>to</b> your home, Sam!” he said. “Then cut along <b>the</b> Row <b>and</b> meet us as quick as you can at <b>the</b> gate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lane beyond <b>the</b> meadows. We are not going through <b>the</b> village tonight. Too many ears pricking <b>and</b> eyes prying.” Sam ran off at full speed.
<br>   “Well, now we’re off at last!” said Frodo. They shouldered their packs <b>and</b> took up their sticks, <b>and</b> walked round <b>the</b> corner <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> Bag End. “Good-bye!” said Frodo, looking at <b>the</b> dark blank windows. He waved his hand, <b>and</b> then turned <b>and</b> (following Bilbo, if he <b>had</b> known <b>it</b>) hurried after Peregrin down <b>the</b> garden-path. They jumped over <b>the</b> low place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hedge at <b>the</b> bottom <b>and</b> took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fields, passing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness like a rustle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grasses.
<br>   At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hill <b>on</b> its western side they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate opening <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a narrow lane. There they halted <b>and</b> adjusted <b>the</b> straps <b>of</b> their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly <b>and</b> breathing hard; his heavy pack <b>was</b> hoisted high <b>on</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> put <b>on</b> his head a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In <b>the</b> gloom he looked <b>very</b> much like a dwarf.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sure you have given me all <b>the</b> heaviest stuff,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> pity snails, <b>and</b> all that carry their homes <b>on</b> their backs.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet <b>is</b> quite light,” said Sam stoutly <b>and</b> untruthfully.
<br>   “No, you don’t, Sam!” said Pippin. “It <b>is</b> good for him. He’s got <b>nothing</b> except <b>what</b> he ordered us <b>to</b> pack. He’s been slack lately, <b>and</b> he’ll feel <b>the</b> weight less when he’s walked off some <b>of</b> his own.”
<br>   “Be kind <b>to</b> a poor old hobbit!” laughed Frodo. “<b>I</b> shall be as thin as a willow-wand, <b>I</b>’m sure, before <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Buckland. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking nonsense. <b>I</b> suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall look <b>into</b> <b>it</b> at our next packing.” He picked up his stick again. “Well, we all like walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark,” he said, “so let’s put some miles behind us before bed.”
<br>   For a short way they followed <b>the</b> lane westwards. Then leaving <b>it</b> they turned left <b>and</b> took quietly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fields again. They went <b>in</b> single file along hedgerows <b>and</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> coppices, <b>and</b> night fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all <b>had</b> magic rings. Since they were all hobbits, <b>and</b> were trying <b>to</b> be silent, they made <b>no</b> noise that even hobbits would hear. Even <b>the</b> wild things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields <b>and</b> woods hardly noticed their passing.
<br>   After some time they crossed <b>the</b> Water, west <b>of</b> Hobbiton, <b>by</b> a narrow plank-bridge. The stream <b>was</b> there <b>no</b> more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile <b>or</b> two further south they hastily crossed <b>the</b> great road from <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge; they were now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tookland <b>and</b> bending south-eastwards they made for <b>the</b> Green Hill Country. As they began <b>to</b> climb its first slopes they looked back <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> lamps <b>in</b> Hobbiton far off twinkling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gentle valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water. Soon <b>it</b> disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> folds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkened land, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> followed <b>by</b> Bywater beside its grey pool. When <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last farm <b>was</b> far behind, peeping among <b>the</b> trees, Frodo turned <b>and</b> waved a hand <b>in</b> farewell.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder if <b>I</b> shall ever look down <b>into</b> that valley again,” he said quietly.
<br>   When they <b>had</b> walked for about three hours they rested. The night <b>was</b> clear, cool, <b>and</b> starry, <b>but</b> smoke-like wisps <b>of</b> mist were creeping up <b>the</b> hill-sides from <b>the</b> streams <b>and</b> deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying <b>in</b> a light wind above their heads, made a black net against <b>the</b> pale sky. They ate a <b>very</b> frugal supper (for hobbits), <b>and</b> then went <b>on</b> again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling up <b>and</b> down, fading grey <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness ahead: <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> Woodhall, <b>and</b> Stock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from <b>the</b> main road <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Water-valley, <b>and</b> wound over <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing.
<br>   After a while they plunged <b>into</b> a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. It <b>was</b> <b>very</b> dark. At first they talked, <b>or</b> hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they marched <b>on</b> <b>in</b> silence, <b>and</b> Pippin began <b>to</b> lag behind. At last, as they began <b>to</b> climb a steep slope, he stopped <b>and</b> yawned.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am so sleepy,” he said, “that soon <b>I</b> shall fall down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. Are you going <b>to</b> sleep <b>on</b> your legs? It <b>is</b> nearly midnight.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you liked walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark,” said Frodo. “But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> great hurry. Merry expects us some time <b>the</b> day after tomorrow; <b>but</b> that leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt at <b>the</b> first likely spot.”
<br>   “The wind’s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West,” said Sam. “If we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> this hill, we shall find a spot that <b>is</b> sheltered <b>and</b> snug enough, sir. There <b>is</b> a dry fir-wood just ahead, if <b>I</b> remember rightly.” Sam knew <b>the</b> land well within twenty miles <b>of</b> Hobbiton, <b>but</b> that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> limit <b>of</b> his geography.
<br>   Just over <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill they came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> patch <b>of</b> fir-wood. Leaving <b>the</b> road they went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep resin-scented darkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> gathered dead sticks <b>and</b> cones <b>to</b> make a fire. Soon they <b>had</b> a merry crackle <b>of</b> flame at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> a large fir-tree <b>and</b> they sat round <b>it</b> for a while, until they began <b>to</b> nod. Then, each <b>in</b> an angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great tree’s roots, they curled up <b>in</b> their cloaks <b>and</b> blankets, <b>and</b> were soon fast asleep. They set <b>no</b> watch; even Frodo feared <b>no</b> danger yet, for they were still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. A few creatures came <b>and</b> looked at them when <b>the</b> fire <b>had</b> died away. A fox passing through <b>the</b> wood <b>on</b> business <b>of</b> his own stopped several minutes <b>and</b> sniffed.
<br>   “Hobbits!” he <b>thought</b>. “Well, <b>what</b> next? <b>I</b> have heard <b>of</b> strange doings <b>in</b> this land, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have seldom heard <b>of</b> a hobbit sleeping out <b>of</b> doors under a tree. Three <b>of</b> them! There’s something mighty queer behind this.” He <b>was</b> quite right, <b>but</b> he never found out any more about <b>it</b>.
<br>   The morning came, pale <b>and</b> clammy. Frodo woke up first, <b>and</b> found that a tree-root <b>had</b> made a hole <b>in</b> his back, <b>and</b> that his neck <b>was</b> stiff.
<br>   “Walking for pleasure! Why didn’t <b>I</b> drive?” he <b>thought</b>, as he usually did at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> an expedition. “And all my beautiful feather beds are sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would <b>do</b> them good.” He stretched. “Wake up, hobbits!” he cried. It’s a beautiful morning.”
<br>   “What’s beautiful about <b>it</b>?” said Pippin, peering over <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> his blanket with one eye. “Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you got <b>the</b> bath-water hot?”
<br>   Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. “No, sir, <b>I</b> haven’t, sir!” he said.
<br>   Frodo stripped <b>the</b> blankets from Pippin <b>and</b> rolled him over, <b>and</b> then walked off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Away eastward <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> rising red out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mists that lay thick <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world. Touched with gold <b>and</b> red <b>the</b> autumn trees seemed <b>to</b> be sailing rootless <b>in</b> a shadowy sea. A little below him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>the</b> road ran down steeply <b>into</b> a hollow <b>and</b> disappeared.
<br>   When he returned Sam <b>and</b> Pippin <b>had</b> got a good fire going. “Water!” shouted Pippin. “Where’s <b>the</b> water?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t keep water <b>in</b> my pockets,” said Frodo. “We <b>thought</b> you <b>had</b> gone <b>to</b> find some,” said Pippin, busy setting out <b>the</b> food, <b>and</b> cups. “You <b>had</b> better go now.”
<br>   “You can come too,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> bring all <b>the</b> water-bottles.” There <b>was</b> a stream at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. They filled their bottles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> small camping kettle at a little fall where <b>the</b> water fell a few feet over an outcrop <b>of</b> grey stone. It <b>was</b> icy cold; <b>and</b> they spluttered <b>and</b> puffed as they bathed their faces <b>and</b> hands.
<br>   When their breakfast <b>was</b> over, <b>and</b> their packs all trussed up again, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> after ten o’clock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> turn fine <b>and</b> hot. They went down <b>the</b> slope, <b>and</b> across <b>the</b> stream where <b>it</b> dived under <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> next slope, <b>and</b> up <b>and</b> down another shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, <b>and</b> other gear already seemed a heavy burden.
<br>   The day’s march promised <b>to</b> be warm <b>and</b> tiring work. After some miles, however, <b>the</b> road ceased <b>to</b> roll up <b>and</b> down: <b>it</b> climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a steep <b>bank</b> <b>in</b> a weary zig-zagging sort <b>of</b> way, <b>and</b> then prepared <b>to</b> go down for <b>the</b> last time. In front <b>of</b> them they saw <b>the</b> lower lands dotted with small clumps <b>of</b> trees that melted away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance <b>to</b> a brown woodland haze. They were looking across <b>the</b> Woody End towards <b>the</b> Brandywine River. The road wound away before them like a piece <b>of</b> string.
<br>   “The road goes <b>on</b> for ever,” said Pippin; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> can’t <b>without</b> a rest. It <b>is</b> high time for lunch.” He sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> at <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> looked away east <b>into</b> <b>the</b> haze, beyond which lay <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> which he <b>had</b> spent all his life. Sam stood <b>by</b> him. His round eyes were wide open—for he <b>was</b> looking across lands he <b>had</b> never seen <b>to</b> a new horizon.
<br>   “Do Elves live <b>in</b> those woods?” he asked.
<br>   “Not that <b>I</b> ever heard,” said Pippin. Frodo <b>was</b> silent. He too <b>was</b> gazing eastward along <b>the</b> road, as if he <b>had</b> never seen <b>it</b> before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud <b>but</b> as if <b>to</b> himself, saying slowly:
<br>   
<br>The Road goes ever <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b>
<br>Down from <b>the</b> door where <b>it</b> began.
<br>Now far ahead <b>the</b> Road has gone,
<br>And <b>I</b> must follow, if <b>I</b> can,
<br>Pursuing <b>it</b> with weary feet,
<br>Until <b>it</b> joins some larger way,
<br>Where many paths <b>and</b> errands meet.
<br>And whither then? <b>I</b> cannot say.
<br>   
<br>   “That sounds like a bit <b>of</b> old Bilbo’s rhyming,” said Pippin. “Or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> one <b>of</b> your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t know,” said Frodo. It came <b>to</b> me then, as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making <b>it</b> up; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> may have heard <b>it</b> long ago. Certainly <b>it</b> reminds me <b>very</b> much <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last years, before he went away. He used often <b>to</b> say there <b>was</b> only one Road; that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, <b>and</b> every path <b>was</b> its tributary. “It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out <b>of</b> your door,” he used <b>to</b> say. “You step <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> if you don’t keep your feet, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> knowing where you might be swept off <b>to</b>. Do you realize that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> path that goes through Mirkwood, <b>and</b> that if you let <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> might take you <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain <b>or</b> even further <b>and</b> <b>to</b> worse places?” He used <b>to</b> say that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path outside <b>the</b> front door at Bag End, especially after he <b>had</b> been out for a long walk.”
<br>   “Well, <b>the</b> Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,” said Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their packs against <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> their legs out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> road. After a rest they <b>had</b> a good lunch, <b>and</b> then more rest.
<br>   The sun <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> low <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> afternoon <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land as they went down <b>the</b> hill. So far they <b>had</b> not met a soul <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road. This way <b>was</b> not much used, being hardly fit for carts, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> little traffic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Woody End. They <b>had</b> been jogging along again for an hour <b>or</b> more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now <b>on</b> level ground, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approaching woods.
<br>   “<b>I</b> can hear a pony <b>or</b> a horse coming along <b>the</b> road behind,” said Sam.
<br>   They looked back, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> turn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road prevented them from seeing far. “<b>I</b> wonder if that <b>is</b> Gandalf coming after us,” said Frodo; <b>but</b> even as he said <b>it</b>, he <b>had</b> a feeling that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not so, <b>and</b> a sudden desire <b>to</b> hide from <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider came over him.
<br>   “It may not matter much,” he said apologetically, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> would rather not be seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road—<b>by</b> anyone. <b>I</b> am sick <b>of</b> my doings being noticed <b>and</b> discussed. And if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Gandalf,” he added as an afterthought, “we can give him a little surprise, <b>to</b> pay him out for being so late. Let’s <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> sight!”
<br>   The other two ran quickly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> a little hollow not far from <b>the</b> road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity <b>or</b> some other feeling <b>was</b> struggling with his desire <b>to</b> hide. The sound <b>of</b> hoofs drew nearer. Just <b>in</b> time he threw himself down <b>in</b> a patch <b>of</b> long grass behind a tree that overshadowed <b>the</b> road. Then he lifted his head <b>and</b> peered cautiously above one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great roots.
<br>   Round <b>the</b> corner came a black horse, <b>no</b> hobbit-pony <b>but</b> a full-sized horse; <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> sat a large man, who seemed <b>to</b> crouch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> saddle, wrapped <b>in</b> a great black cloak <b>and</b> hood, so that only his boots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high stirrups showed below; his face <b>was</b> shadowed <b>and</b> invisible.
<br>   When <b>it</b> reached <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> <b>was</b> level with Frodo <b>the</b> horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From inside <b>the</b> hood came a noise as <b>of</b> someone sniffing <b>to</b> catch an elusive scent; <b>the</b> head turned from side <b>to</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>   A sudden unreasoning fear <b>of</b> discovery laid hold <b>of</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his Ring. He hardly dared <b>to</b> breathe, <b>and</b> yet <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> his pocket became so strong that he began slowly <b>to</b> move his hand. He felt that he <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> slip <b>it</b> <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> then he would be safe. The advice <b>of</b> Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo <b>had</b> used <b>the</b> Ring. “And <b>I</b> am still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire,” he <b>thought</b>, as his hand touched <b>the</b> chain <b>on</b> which <b>it</b> hung. At that moment <b>the</b> rider sat up, <b>and</b> shook <b>the</b> reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, <b>and</b> then breaking <b>into</b> a quick trot.
<br>   Frodo crawled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> rider, until he dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance. He could not be quite sure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that suddenly, before <b>it</b> passed out <b>of</b> sight, <b>the</b> horse turned aside <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> call that <b>very</b> queer, <b>and</b> indeed disturbing,” said Frodo <b>to</b> himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin <b>and</b> Sam <b>had</b> remained flat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> seen <b>nothing</b>; so Frodo described <b>the</b> rider <b>and</b> his strange behaviour.
<br>   “<b>I</b> can’t say why, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> felt certain he <b>was</b> looking <b>or</b> smelling for me; <b>and</b> also <b>I</b> felt certain that <b>I</b> did not want him <b>to</b> discover me. <b>I</b>’ve never seen <b>or</b> fell anything like <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire before.”
<br>   “But <b>what</b> has one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us?” said Pippin. “And <b>what</b> <b>is</b> he doing <b>in</b> this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world?”
<br>   “There are some Men about,” said Frodo. “Down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing they have <b>had</b> trouble with Big People, <b>I</b> believe. But <b>I</b> have never heard <b>of</b> anything like this rider. <b>I</b> wonder where he comes from.”
<br>   “Begging your pardon,” put <b>in</b> Sam suddenly, “<b>I</b> know where he comes from. It’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there’s more than one. And <b>I</b> know where he’s going <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” said Frodo sharply, looking at him <b>in</b> astonishment. “Why didn’t you speak up before?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have only just remembered, sir. It <b>was</b> like this: when <b>I</b> got back <b>to</b> our hole yesterday evening with <b>the</b> key, my dad, he says <b>to</b> me: Hello, Sam! he says. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There’s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins <b>of</b> Bag End, <b>and</b> he’s only just gone. <b>I</b>’ve sent him <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Bucklebury. Not that <b>I</b> liked <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> him. He seemed mighty put out, when <b>I</b> told him Mr. Baggins <b>had</b> left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort <b>of</b> a fellow <b>was</b> he? says <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer. <b>I</b> don’t know, says he; <b>but</b> he wasn’t a hobbit. He <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> black-like, <b>and</b> he stooped aver me. <b>I</b> reckon <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny.
<br>   “<b>I</b> couldn’t stay <b>to</b> hear more, sir, since you were waiting; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn’t give much heed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> myself. The Gaffer <b>is</b> getting old, <b>and</b> more than a bit blind, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> must have been near dark when this fellow come up <b>the</b> Hill <b>and</b> found him taking <b>the</b> air at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> our Row. <b>I</b> hope he hasn’t done <b>no</b> harm, sir, nor me.”
<br>   “The Gaffer can’t be blamed anyway,” said Frodo. “As a matter <b>of</b> fact <b>I</b> heard him talking <b>to</b> a stranger, who seemed <b>to</b> be inquiring for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> nearly went <b>and</b> asked him who <b>it</b> <b>was</b>. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b>, <b>or</b> you <b>had</b> told me about <b>it</b> before. <b>I</b> might have been more careful <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Still, there may be <b>no</b> connexion between this rider <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gaffer’s stranger,” said Pippin. “We left Hobbiton secretly enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don’t see how he could have followed us.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> smelling, sir?” said Sam. “And <b>the</b> Gaffer said he <b>was</b> a black chap.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> waited for Gandalf,” Frodo muttered. “But perhaps <b>it</b> would only have made matters worse.”
<br>   “Then you know <b>or</b> guess something about this rider?” said Pippin, who <b>had</b> caught <b>the</b> muttered words.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would rather not guess,” said Frodo. “All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for <b>the</b> present, if you want <b>to</b> be mysterious. In <b>the</b> meanwhile <b>what</b> are we <b>to</b> <b>do</b>? <b>I</b> should like a bite <b>and</b> a sup, <b>but</b> somehow <b>I</b> think we <b>had</b> better move <b>on</b> from here. Your talk <b>of</b> sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> think we will move <b>on</b> now,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road -<b>in</b> case that rider comes back, <b>or</b> another follows him. We ought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good step more today. Buckland <b>is</b> still miles away.”
<br>   The shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees were long <b>and</b> thin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, as they started off again. They now kept a stone’s throw <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road, <b>and</b> kept out <b>of</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as much as they could. But this hindered them; for <b>the</b> grass <b>was</b> thick <b>and</b> tussocky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground uneven, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees began <b>to</b> draw together <b>into</b> thickets.
<br>   The sun <b>had</b> gone down red behind <b>the</b> hills at their backs, <b>and</b> evening <b>was</b> coming <b>on</b> before they came back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long level over which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> run straight for some miles. At that point <b>it</b> bent left <b>and</b> went down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lowlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yale making for Stock; <b>but</b> a lane branched right, winding through a wood <b>of</b> ancient oak-trees <b>on</b> its way <b>to</b> Woodhall. “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way for us,” said Frodo.
<br>   Not far from <b>the</b> road-meeting they came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> huge hulk <b>of</b> a tree: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still alive <b>and</b> <b>had</b> leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small branches that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> put out round <b>the</b> broken stumps <b>of</b> its long-fallen limbs; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hollow, <b>and</b> could be entered <b>by</b> a great crack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side away from <b>the</b> road. The hobbits crept inside, <b>and</b> sat there upon a floor <b>of</b> old leaves <b>and</b> decayed wood. They rested <b>and</b> <b>had</b> a light meal, talking quietly <b>and</b> listening from time <b>to</b> time.
<br>   Twilight <b>was</b> about them as they crept back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lane. The West wind <b>was</b> sighing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon <b>the</b> road began <b>to</b> fall gently <b>but</b> steadily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk. A star came out above <b>the</b> trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkening East before them. They went abreast <b>and</b> <b>in</b> step, <b>to</b> keep up their spirits. After a time, as <b>the</b> stars grew thicker <b>and</b> brighter, <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> disquiet left them, <b>and</b> they <b>no</b> longer listened for <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> hoofs. They began <b>to</b> hum softly, as hobbits have a way <b>of</b> doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near <b>to</b> home at night. With most hobbits <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a supper-song <b>or</b> a bed-song; <b>but</b> these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, <b>of</b> course, <b>without</b> any mention <b>of</b> supper <b>and</b> bed). Bilbo Baggins <b>had</b> made <b>the</b> words, <b>to</b> a tune that <b>was</b> as old as <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> taught <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Frodo as they walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lanes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Water-valley <b>and</b> talked about Adventure.
<br>   
<br>Upon <b>the</b> hearth <b>the</b> fire <b>is</b> red,
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> roof there <b>is</b> a bed;
<br>But not yet weary are our feet,
<br>Still round <b>the</b> corner we may meet
<br>A sudden tree <b>or</b> standing stone
<br>That none have seen <b>but</b> we alone.
<br>Tree <b>and</b> flower <b>and</b> leaf <b>and</b> grass,
<br>Let them pass! Let them pass!
<br>Hill <b>and</b> water under sky,
<br>Pass them <b>by</b>! Pass them <b>by</b>!
<br>
<br>Still round <b>the</b> corner there may wait
<br>A new road <b>or</b> a secret gate,
<br>And though we pass them <b>by</b> today,
<br>Tomorrow we may come this way
<br>And take <b>the</b> hidden paths that run
<br>Towards <b>the</b> Moon <b>or</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sun.
<br>Apple, thorn, <b>and</b> nut <b>and</b> sloe,
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>Sand <b>and</b> stone <b>and</b> pool <b>and</b> dell,
<br>Fare you well! Fare you well!
<br>
<br>Home <b>is</b> behind, <b>the</b> world ahead,
<br>And there are many paths <b>to</b> tread
<br>Through shadows <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> night,
<br>Until <b>the</b> stars are all alight.
<br>Then world behind <b>and</b> home ahead,
<br>We’ll wander back <b>to</b> home <b>and</b> bed.
<br>Mist <b>and</b> twilight, cloud <b>and</b> shade,
<br>Away shall fade! Away shall fade!
<br>Fire <b>and</b> lamp, <b>and</b> meat <b>and</b> bread,
<br>And then <b>to</b> bed! And then <b>to</b> bed!
<br>   
<br>   The song ended. “And now <b>to</b> bed! And now <b>to</b> bed!” sang Pippin <b>in</b> a high voice.
<br>   “Hush!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> hear hoofs again.”
<br>   They slopped suddenly <b>and</b> stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There <b>was</b> a sound <b>of</b> hoofs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lane, some way behind, <b>but</b> coming slow <b>and</b> clear down <b>the</b> wind. Quickly <b>and</b> quietly they slipped off <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeper shade under <b>the</b> oak-trees.
<br>   “Don’t let us go too far!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> don’t want <b>to</b> be seen, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> see if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> another Black Rider.”
<br>   “Very well!” said Pippin. “But don’t forget <b>the</b> sniffing!”
<br>   The hoofs drew nearer. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> find any hiding-place better than <b>the</b> general darkness under <b>the</b> trees; Sam <b>and</b> Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards <b>the</b> lane. It showed grey <b>and</b> pale, a line <b>of</b> fading light through <b>the</b> wood. Above <b>it</b> <b>the</b> stars were thick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim sky, <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> moon.
<br>   The sound <b>of</b> hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass across <b>the</b> lighter space between two trees, <b>and</b> then halt. It looked like <b>the</b> black shade <b>of</b> a horse led <b>by</b> a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where they <b>had</b> left <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> swayed from side <b>to</b> side. Frodo <b>thought</b> he heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> snuffling. The shadow bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> then began <b>to</b> crawl towards him.
<br>   Once more <b>the</b> desire <b>to</b> slip <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring came over Frodo; <b>but</b> this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized <b>what</b> he <b>was</b> doing, his hand <b>was</b> groping <b>in</b> his pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like mingled song <b>and</b> laughter. Clear voices rose <b>and</b> fell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starlit air. The black shadow straightened up <b>and</b> retreated. It climbed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shadowy horse <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> vanish across <b>the</b> lane <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. Frodo breathed again.
<br>   “Elves!” exclaimed Sam <b>in</b> a hoarse whisper. “Elves, sir!” He would have burst out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> dashed off towards <b>the</b> voices, if they <b>had</b> not pulled him back.
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Elves,” said Frodo. “One can meet them sometimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Woody End. They don’t live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> they wander <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Spring <b>and</b> Autumn, out <b>of</b> their own lands away beyond <b>the</b> Tower Hills. <b>I</b> am thankful that they <b>do</b>! You did not see, <b>but</b> that Black Rider stopped just here <b>and</b> <b>was</b> actually crawling towards us when <b>the</b> song began. As soon as he heard <b>the</b> voices he slipped away.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> Elves?” said Sam, too excited <b>to</b> trouble about <b>the</b> rider. “Can’t we go <b>and</b> see them?”
<br>   “Listen! They are coming this way,” said Frodo. “We have only <b>to</b> wait.” The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above <b>the</b> others. It <b>was</b> singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fair elven-tongue, <b>of</b> which Frodo knew only a little, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others knew <b>nothing</b>. Yet <b>the</b> sound blending with <b>the</b> melody seemed <b>to</b> shape itself <b>in</b> their <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> words which they only partly understood. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> song as Frodo heard <b>it</b>:
<br>   
<br>Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!
<br>O Queen beyond <b>the</b> Western Seas!
<br>O Light <b>to</b> us that wander here
<br>Amid <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> woven trees!
<br>
<br>Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!
<br>Clear are thy eyes <b>and</b> bright thy breath!
<br>Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing <b>to</b> thee
<br>In a far land beyond <b>the</b> Sea.
<br>
<br>O stars that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sunless Year
<br>With shining hand <b>by</b> <b>her</b> were sawn,
<br>In windy fields now bright <b>and</b> clear
<br>We see your silver blossom blown!
<br>
<br>O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!
<br>We still remember, we who dwell
<br>In this far land beneath <b>the</b> trees,
<br>Thy starlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Seas.
<br>   
<br>   The song ended. “These are High Elves! They spoke <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Elbereth!” said Frodo <b>in</b> amazement, “Few <b>of</b> that fairest folk are ever seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Not many now remain <b>in</b> Middle-earth, east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Sea. This <b>is</b> indeed a strange chance!”
<br>   The hobbits sat <b>in</b> shadow <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wayside. Before long <b>the</b> Elves came down <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> valley. They passed slowly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits could see <b>the</b> starlight glimmering <b>on</b> their hair <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their eyes. They bore <b>no</b> lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon above <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills before <b>it</b> rises, seemed <b>to</b> fall about their feet. They were now silent, <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> last Elf passed he turned <b>and</b> looked towards <b>the</b> hobbits <b>and</b> laughed.
<br>   “Hail, Frodo!” he cried. “You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps lost?” Then he called aloud <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> company stopped <b>and</b> gathered round.
<br>   “This <b>is</b> indeed wonderful!” they said. “Three hobbits <b>in</b> a wood at night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “The meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, fair people,” said Frodo, “<b>is</b> simply that we seem <b>to</b> be going <b>the</b> same way as you are. <b>I</b> like walking under <b>the</b> stars. But <b>I</b> would welcome your company.”
<br>   “But we have <b>no</b> need <b>of</b> other company, <b>and</b> hobbits are so dull,” they laughed. “And how <b>do</b> you know that we go <b>the</b> same way as you, for you <b>do</b> not know whither we are going?”
<br>   “And how <b>do</b> you know my name?” asked Frodo <b>in</b> return.
<br>   “We know many things,” they said. “We have seen you often before with Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.”
<br>   “Who are you, <b>and</b> who <b>is</b> your lord?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am Gildor,” answered their leader, <b>the</b> Elf who <b>had</b> first hailed him. “Gildor Inglorion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Finrod. We are Exiles, <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> our kindred have long ago departed <b>and</b> we too are now only tarrying here a while, ere we return over <b>the</b> Great Sea. But some <b>of</b> our kinsfolk dwell still <b>in</b> peace <b>in</b> Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us <b>what</b> you are doing? For we see that there <b>is</b> some shadow <b>of</b> fear upon you.”
<br>   “O Wise People!” interrupted Pippin eagerly. “Tell us about <b>the</b> Black Riders!”
<br>   “Black Riders?” they said <b>in</b> low voices. “Why <b>do</b> you ask about Black Riders?”
<br>   “Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, <b>or</b> one has done so <b>twice</b>,” said Pippin; “only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near.”
<br>   The Elves did not answer at <b>once</b>, <b>but</b> spoke together softly <b>in</b> their own tongue. At length Gildor turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “We will not speak <b>of</b> this here,” he said. “We think you <b>had</b> best come now with us. It <b>is</b> not our custom, <b>but</b> for this time we will lake you <b>on</b> our road, <b>and</b> you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.”
<br>   “O Fair Folk! This <b>is</b> good fortune beyond my hope,” said Pippin. Sam <b>was</b> speechless. “<b>I</b> thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,” said Frodo bowing. “Elen s?la l?menn” omentielvo, a star shines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hour <b>of</b> our meeting,” he added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-elven speech.
<br>   “Be careful, friends!” cried Gildor laughing. “Speak <b>no</b> secrets! Here <b>is</b> a scholar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Tongue. Bilbo <b>was</b> a good master. Hail, Elf-friend!” he said, bowing <b>to</b> Frodo. “Come now with your friends <b>and</b> join our company! You <b>had</b> best walk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle so that you may not stray. You may be weary before we halt.”
<br>   “Why? Where are you going?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “For tonight we go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills above Woodhall. It <b>is</b> some miles, <b>but</b> you shall have rest at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will shorten your journey tomorrow.”
<br>   They now marched <b>on</b> again <b>in</b> silence, <b>and</b> passed like shadows <b>and</b> faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished <b>without</b> sound <b>or</b> footfall. Pippin soon began <b>to</b> feel sleepy, <b>and</b> staggered <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b>; <b>but</b> each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm <b>and</b> saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo’s side, as if <b>in</b> a dream, with an expression <b>on</b> his face half <b>of</b> fear <b>and</b> half <b>of</b> astonished joy.
<br>   The woods <b>on</b> either side became denser; <b>the</b> trees were now younger <b>and</b> thicker; <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> lane went lower, running down <b>into</b> a fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, there were many deep brakes <b>of</b> hazel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rising slopes at either hand. At last <b>the</b> Elves turned aside from <b>the</b> path. A green ride lay almost unseen through <b>the</b> thickets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right; <b>and</b> this they followed as <b>it</b> wound away back up <b>the</b> wooded slopes <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills that stood out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river-valley. Suddenly they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> before them lay a wide space <b>of</b> grass, grey under <b>the</b> night. On three sides <b>the</b> woods pressed upon <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> eastward <b>the</b> ground fell steeply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark trees, growing at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slope, were below their feet. Beyond, <b>the</b> low lands lay dim <b>and</b> flat under <b>the</b> stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Woodhall.
<br>   The Elves sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>and</b> spoke together <b>in</b> soft voices; they seemed <b>to</b> take <b>no</b> further notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. Frodo <b>and</b> his companions wrapped themselves <b>in</b> cloaks <b>and</b> blankets, <b>and</b> drowsiness stole over them. The night grew <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed <b>on</b> a green hillock.
<br>   Away high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East swung Remmirath, <b>the</b> Netted Stars, <b>and</b> slowly above <b>the</b> mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel <b>of</b> fire. Then <b>by</b> some shift <b>of</b> airs all <b>the</b> mist <b>was</b> drawn away like a veil, <b>and</b> there leaned up, as he climbed over <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>the</b> Swordsman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst <b>into</b> song. Suddenly under <b>the</b> trees a fire sprang up with a red light.
<br>   “Come!” <b>the</b> Elves called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Come! Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time for speech <b>and</b> merriment!”
<br>   Pippin sat up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes. He shivered. “There <b>is</b> a fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> food for hungry guests,” said an Elf standing before him.
<br>   At <b>the</b> south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greensward there <b>was</b> an opening. There <b>the</b> green floor ran <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood, <b>and</b> formed a wide space like a hall, roofed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In <b>the</b> middle there <b>was</b> a wood-fire blazing, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> tree-pillars torches with lights <b>of</b> gold <b>and</b> silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round <b>the</b> fire upon <b>the</b> grass <b>or</b> upon <b>the</b> sawn rings <b>of</b> old trunks. Some went <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro bearing cups <b>and</b> pouring drink; others brought food <b>on</b> heaped plates <b>and</b> dishes.
<br>   “This <b>is</b> poor fare,” they said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits; “for we are lodging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat you better.”
<br>   “It seems <b>to</b> me good enough for a birthday-party,” said Frodo.
<br>   Pippin afterwards recalled little <b>of</b> either food <b>or</b> drink, for his mind <b>was</b> filled with <b>the</b> light upon <b>the</b> elf-faces, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> voices so various <b>and</b> so beautiful that he felt <b>in</b> a waking dream. But he remembered that there <b>was</b> bread, surpassing <b>the</b> savour <b>of</b> a fair white loaf <b>to</b> one who <b>is</b> starving; <b>and</b> fruits sweet as wildberries <b>and</b> richer than <b>the</b> tended fruits <b>of</b> gardens; he drained a cup that <b>was</b> filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon.
<br>   Sam could never describe <b>in</b> words, nor picture clearly <b>to</b> himself, <b>what</b> he felt <b>or</b> <b>thought</b> that night, though <b>it</b> remained <b>in</b> his memory as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief events <b>of</b> his life. The nearest he ever got <b>was</b> <b>to</b> say: “Well, sir, if <b>I</b> could grow apples like that, <b>I</b> would call myself a gardener. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> singing that went <b>to</b> my heart, if you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean.”
<br>   Frodo sat, eating, drinking, <b>and</b> talking with delight; <b>but</b> his mind <b>was</b> chiefly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> words spoken. He knew a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elf-speech <b>and</b> listened eagerly. Now <b>and</b> again he spoke <b>to</b> those that served him <b>and</b> thanked them <b>in</b> their own language. They smiled at him <b>and</b> said laughing: “Here <b>is</b> a jewel among hobbits!”
<br>   After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> lifted up <b>and</b> borne away <b>to</b> a bower under <b>the</b> trees; there he <b>was</b> laid upon a soft bed <b>and</b> slept <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night away. Sam refused <b>to</b> leave his master. When Pippin <b>had</b> gone, he came <b>and</b> sat curled up at Frodo’s feet, where at last he nodded <b>and</b> closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.
<br>   They spoke <b>of</b> many things, old <b>and</b> new, <b>and</b> Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide world outside <b>the</b> Shire. The tidings were mostly sad <b>and</b> ominous: <b>of</b> gathering darkness, <b>the</b> wars <b>of</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. At last Frodo asked <b>the</b> question that <b>was</b> nearest <b>to</b> his heart:
<br>   “Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?”
<br>   Gildor smiled. “Yes,” he answered. “Twice. He said farewell <b>to</b> us <b>on</b> this <b>very</b> spot. But <b>I</b> saw him <b>once</b> again, far from here.” He would say <b>no</b> more about Bilbo, <b>and</b> Frodo fell silent.
<br>   “You <b>do</b> not ask me <b>or</b> tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,” said Gildor. “But <b>I</b> already know a little, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can read more <b>in</b> your face <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> behind your questions. You are leaving <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> yet you doubt that you will find <b>what</b> you seek, <b>or</b> accomplish <b>what</b> you intend, <b>or</b> that you will ever return. Is not that so?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b>,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> my going <b>was</b> a secret known only <b>to</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> my faithful Sam.” He looked down at Sam, who <b>was</b> snoring gently.
<br>   “The secret will not reach <b>the</b> Enemy from us,” said Gildor.
<br>   “The Enemy?” said Frodo. “Then you know why <b>I</b> am leaving <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know for <b>what</b> reason <b>the</b> Enemy <b>is</b> pursuing you,” answered Gildor; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> perceive that he <b>is</b>—strange indeed though that seems <b>to</b> me. And <b>I</b> warn you that peril <b>is</b> now both before you <b>and</b> behind you, <b>and</b> upon either side.”
<br>   “You mean <b>the</b> Riders? <b>I</b> feared that they were servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. What are <b>the</b> Black Riders?”
<br>   “Has Gandalf told you <b>nothing</b>?”
<br>   “Nothing about such creatures.”
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not for me <b>to</b> say more—lest terror should keep you from your journey. For <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me that you have set out only just <b>in</b> time, if indeed you are <b>in</b> time. You must now make haste, <b>and</b> neither stay nor turn back; for <b>the</b> Shire <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer any protection <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> cannot imagine <b>what</b> information could be more terrifying than your hints <b>and</b> warnings,” exclaimed Frodo. “<b>I</b> knew that danger lay ahead, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> did not expect <b>to</b> meet <b>it</b> <b>in</b> our own Shire. Can’t a hobbit walk from <b>the</b> Water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River <b>in</b> peace?”
<br>   “But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not your own Shire,” said Gildor. “Others dwelt here before hobbits were; <b>and</b> others will dwell here again when hobbits are <b>no</b> more. The wide world <b>is</b> all about you: you can fence yourselves <b>in</b>, <b>but</b> you cannot for ever fence <b>it</b> out.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know—<b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> has always seemed so safe <b>and</b> familiar. What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now? My plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire secretly, <b>and</b> make my way <b>to</b> Rivendell; <b>but</b> now my footsteps are dogged, before ever <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Buckland.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think you should still follow that plan,” said Gildor. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>the</b> Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>the</b> reason for your flight, <b>and</b> therefore <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>by</b> <b>what</b> means your pursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. <b>I</b> suppose that you will see him before you leave <b>the</b> Shire?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope so. But that <b>is</b> another thing that makes me anxious. <b>I</b> have been expecting Gandalf for many days. He <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have come <b>to</b> Hobbiton at <b>the</b> latest two nights ago; <b>but</b> he has never appeared. Now <b>I</b> am wondering <b>what</b> can have happened. Should <b>I</b> wait for him?”
<br>   Gildor <b>was</b> silent for a moment. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like this news,” he said at last. “That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said: Do not meddle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affairs <b>of</b> Wizards, for they are subtle <b>and</b> quick <b>to</b> anger. The choice <b>is</b> yours: <b>to</b> go <b>or</b> wait.”
<br>   “And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also said,” answered Frodo: “Go not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves for counsel, for they will say both <b>no</b> <b>and</b> yes.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> indeed?” laughed Gildor. “Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice <b>is</b> a dangerous gift, even from <b>the</b> wise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wise, <b>and</b> all courses may run ill. But <b>what</b> would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; <b>and</b> how then shall <b>I</b> choose better than you? But if you demand advice, <b>I</b> will for friendship’s sake give <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> think you should now go at <b>once</b>, <b>without</b> delay; <b>and</b> if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then <b>I</b> also advise this: <b>do</b> not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty <b>and</b> willing. Now you should be grateful, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their own labours <b>and</b> their own sorrows, <b>and</b> they are little concerned with <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> hobbits, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> any other creatures upon earth. Our paths cross theirs seldom, <b>by</b> chance <b>or</b> purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> purpose <b>is</b> not clear <b>to</b> me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fear <b>to</b> say too much.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am deeply grateful,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> wish you would tell me plainly <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders are. If <b>I</b> take your advice <b>I</b> may not see Gandalf for a long while, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> danger that pursues me.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> not enough <b>to</b> know that they are servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy?” answered Gildor. “Flee them! Speak <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> them! They are deadly. Ask <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all <b>is</b> ended, you, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo, will know more <b>of</b> these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!”
<br>   “But where shall <b>I</b> find courage?” asked Frodo. “That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> chiefly need.”
<br>   “Courage <b>is</b> found <b>in</b> unlikely places,” said Gildor. “Be <b>of</b> good hope! Sleep now! In <b>the</b> morning we shall have gone; <b>but</b> we will send our messages through <b>the</b> lands. The Wandering Companies shall know <b>of</b> your journey, <b>and</b> those that have power for good shall be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch. <b>I</b> name you Elf-friend; <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> stars shine upon <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your road! Seldom have we <b>had</b> such delight <b>in</b> strangers, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fair <b>to</b> hear words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Speech from <b>the</b> lips <b>of</b> other wanderers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. “<b>I</b> will sleep now,” he said; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elf led him <b>to</b> a bower beside Pippin, <b>and</b> he threw himself upon a bed <b>and</b> fell at <b>once</b> <b>into</b> a dreamless slumber.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 4
<br>A SHORT CUT TO MUSHROOMS
<br>
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning Frodo woke refreshed. He <b>was</b> lying <b>in</b> a bower made <b>by</b> a living tree with branches laced <b>and</b> drooping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground; his bed <b>was</b> <b>of</b> fern <b>and</b> grass, deep <b>and</b> soft <b>and</b> strangely fragrant. The sun <b>was</b> shining through <b>the</b> fluttering leaves, which were still green upon <b>the</b> tree. He jumped up <b>and</b> went out.
<br>   Sam <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass near <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Pippin <b>was</b> standing studying <b>the</b> sky <b>and</b> weather. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves.
<br>   “They have left us fruit <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> bread,” said Pippin. “Come <b>and</b> have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as <b>it</b> did last night. <b>I</b> did not want <b>to</b> leave you any, <b>but</b> Sam insisted.”
<br>   Frodo sat down beside Sam <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> eat. “What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> plan for today?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “To walk <b>to</b> Bucklebury as quickly as possible,” answered Frodo, <b>and</b> gave his attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> food.
<br>   “Do you think we shall see anything <b>of</b> those Riders?” asked Pippin cheerfully. Under <b>the</b> morning sun <b>the</b> prospect <b>of</b> seeing a whole troop <b>of</b> them did not seem <b>very</b> alarming <b>to</b> him.
<br>   “Yes, probably,” said Frodo, not liking <b>the</b> reminder. “But <b>I</b> hope <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across <b>the</b> river <b>without</b> their seeing us.”
<br>   “Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?”
<br>   “Not much—only hints <b>and</b> riddles,” said Frodo evasively. “Did you ask about <b>the</b> sniffing?”
<br>   “We didn’t discuss <b>it</b>,” said Frodo with his mouth full.
<br>   “You should have. <b>I</b> am sure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> important.”
<br>   “In that case <b>I</b> am sure Gildor would have refused <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b>,” said Frodo sharply. “And now leave me <b>in</b> peace for a bit! <b>I</b> don’t want <b>to</b> answer a string <b>of</b> questions while <b>I</b> am eating. <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> think!”
<br>   “Good heavens!” said Pippin. “At breakfast?” He walked away towards <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green.
<br>   From Frodo’s mind <b>the</b> bright morning—treacherously bright, he <b>thought</b>—<b>had</b> not banished <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> pursuit; <b>and</b> he pondered <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Gildor. The merry voice <b>of</b> Pippin came <b>to</b> him. He <b>was</b> running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green turf <b>and</b> singing.
<br>   “No! <b>I</b> could not!” he said <b>to</b> himself. “It <b>is</b> one thing <b>to</b> take my young friends walking over <b>the</b> Shire with me, until we are hungry <b>and</b> weary, <b>and</b> food <b>and</b> bed are sweet. To take them <b>into</b> exile, where hunger <b>and</b> weariness may have <b>no</b> cure, <b>is</b> quite another—even if they are willing <b>to</b> come. The inheritance <b>is</b> mine alone. <b>I</b> don’t think <b>I</b> ought even <b>to</b> take Sam.” He looked at Sam Gamgee, <b>and</b> discovered that Sam <b>was</b> watching him.
<br>   “Well, Sam!” he said. “What about <b>it</b>? <b>I</b> am leaving <b>the</b> Shire as soon as ever <b>I</b> can—<b>in</b> fact <b>I</b> have made up my mind now not even <b>to</b> wait a day at Crickhollow, if <b>it</b> can be helped.”
<br>   “Very good, sir!”
<br>   “You still mean <b>to</b> come with me?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> going <b>to</b> be <b>very</b> dangerous, Sam. “It <b>is</b> already dangerous. Most likely neither <b>of</b> us will come back.”
<br>   “If you don’t come back, sir, then <b>I</b> shan’t, that’s certain,” said Sam. “Don’t you leave him! they said <b>to</b> me. Leave him! <b>I</b> said. <b>I</b> never mean <b>to</b>. <b>I</b> am going with him, if he climbs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Moon, <b>and</b> if any <b>of</b> those Black Rulers try <b>to</b> stop him, they’ll have Sam Gamgee <b>to</b> reckon with, <b>I</b> said. They laughed.”
<br>   “Who are they, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> are you talking about?”
<br>   “The Elves, sir. We <b>had</b> some talk last night; <b>and</b> they seemed <b>to</b> know you were going away, so <b>I</b> didn’t see <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> denying <b>it</b>. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!”
<br>   “They are,” said Frodo. “Do you like them still, now you have <b>had</b> a closer view?”
<br>   “They seem a bit above my likes <b>and</b> dislikes, so <b>to</b> speak,” answered Sam slowly. “It don’t seem <b>to</b> matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think about them. They are quite different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expected—so old <b>and</b> young, <b>and</b> so gay <b>and</b> sad, as <b>it</b> were.”
<br>   Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting <b>to</b> see some outward sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> odd change that seemed <b>to</b> have come over him. It did not sound like <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Sam Gamgee that he <b>thought</b> he knew. But <b>it</b> looked like <b>the</b> old Sam Gamgee <b>sitting</b> there, except that his face <b>was</b> unusually thoughtful.
<br>   “Do you feel any need <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire now—now that your wish <b>to</b> see them has come true already?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes, sir. <b>I</b> don’t know how <b>to</b> say <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> after last night <b>I</b> feel different. <b>I</b> seem <b>to</b> see ahead, <b>in</b> a kind <b>of</b> way. <b>I</b> know we are going <b>to</b> take a <b>very</b> long road, <b>into</b> darkness; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> can’t turn back. It isn’t <b>to</b> see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that <b>I</b> want—<b>I</b> don’t rightly know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before <b>the</b> end, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> lies ahead, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. <b>I</b> must see <b>it</b> through, sir, if you understand me.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t altogether. But <b>I</b> understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. <b>I</b> am content. We will go together.”
<br>   Frodo finished his breakfast <b>in</b> silence. Then standing up he looked over <b>the</b> land ahead, <b>and</b> called <b>to</b> Pippin.
<br>   “All ready <b>to</b> start?” he said as Pippin ran up. “We must be getting off at <b>once</b>. We slept late; <b>and</b> there are a good many miles <b>to</b> go.”
<br>   “You slept late, you mean,” said Pippin. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> up long before; <b>and</b> we are only waiting for you <b>to</b> finish eating <b>and</b> thinking.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have finished both now. And <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. <b>I</b> am not going out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road we left last night: <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> cut straight across country from here.”
<br>   “Then you are going <b>to</b> fly,” said Pippin. “You won’t cut straight <b>on</b> foot anywhere <b>in</b> this country.”
<br>   “We can cut straighter than <b>the</b> road anyway,” answered Frodo. “The Ferry <b>is</b> east from Woodhall; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hard road curves away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left—you can see a bend <b>of</b> <b>it</b> away north over there. It goes round <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish so as <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> causeway from <b>the</b> Bridge above Stock. But that <b>is</b> miles out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. We could save a quarter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance if we made a line for <b>the</b> Ferry from where we stand.”
<br>   “Short cuts make long delays,” argued Pippin. “The country <b>is</b> rough round here, <b>and</b> there are bogs <b>and</b> all kinds <b>of</b> difficulties down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marish—<b>I</b> know <b>the</b> land <b>in</b> these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, <b>I</b> can’t see that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> any worse meeting them <b>on</b> a road than <b>in</b> a wood <b>or</b> a field.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> less easy <b>to</b> find people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> fields,” answered Frodo. “And if you are supposed <b>to</b> be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, there <b>is</b> some chance that you will be looked for <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> not off <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “All right!” said Pippin. “<b>I</b> will follow you <b>into</b> every bog <b>and</b> ditch. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hard! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> counted <b>on</b> passing <b>the</b> Golden Perch at Stock before sundown. The best beer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, <b>or</b> used <b>to</b> be: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a long time since <b>I</b> tasted <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “That settles <b>it</b>!” said Frodo. “Short cuts make delays, <b>but</b> inns make longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from <b>the</b> Golden Perch. We want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Bucklebury before dark. What <b>do</b> you say, Sam?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam (<b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> private misgiving <b>and</b> a deep regret for <b>the</b> best beer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing).
<br>   “Then if we are going <b>to</b> toil through bog <b>and</b> briar, let’s go now!” said Pippin.
<br>   It <b>was</b> already nearly as hot as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been <b>the</b> day before; <b>but</b> clouds were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> come up from <b>the</b> West. It looked likely <b>to</b> turn <b>to</b> rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> plunged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> thick trees below. Their course <b>had</b> been chosen <b>to</b> leave Woodhall <b>to</b> their left, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> cut slanting through <b>the</b> woods that clustered along <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, until they reached <b>the</b> flats beyond. Then they could make straight for <b>the</b> Ferry over country that <b>was</b> open, except for a few ditches <b>and</b> fences. Frodo reckoned they <b>had</b> eighteen miles <b>to</b> go <b>in</b> a straight line.
<br>   He soon found that <b>the</b> thicket <b>was</b> closer <b>and</b> more tangled than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> appeared. There were <b>no</b> paths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> undergrowth, <b>and</b> they did not <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>very</b> fast. When they <b>had</b> struggled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, they found a stream running down from <b>the</b> hills behind <b>in</b> a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently <b>it</b> cut across <b>the</b> line they <b>had</b> chosen. They could not jump over <b>it</b>, nor indeed <b>get</b> across <b>it</b> at all <b>without</b> getting wet, scratched, <b>and</b> muddy. They halted, wondering <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>. “First check!” said Pippin, smiling grimly.
<br>   Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green <b>bank</b> from which they <b>had</b> climbed down.
<br>   “Look!” he said, clutching Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm. They all looked, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge high above them they saw against <b>the</b> sky a horse standing. Beside <b>it</b> stooped a black figure.
<br>   They at <b>once</b> gave up any idea <b>of</b> going back. Frodo led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> plunged quickly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> thick bushes beside <b>the</b> stream. “Whew!” he said <b>to</b> Pippin. “We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; <b>but</b> we got under cover only just <b>in</b> time. You’ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?”
<br>   They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit. “<b>I</b> don’t fancy he would try bringing his horse down that <b>bank</b>,” said Sam. “But <b>I</b> guess he knows we came down <b>it</b>. We <b>had</b> better be going <b>on</b>.”
<br>   Going <b>on</b> <b>was</b> not altogether easy. They <b>had</b> packs <b>to</b> carry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> brambles were reluctant <b>to</b> let them through. They were cut off from <b>the</b> wind <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ridge behind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air <b>was</b> still <b>and</b> stuffy. When they forced their way at last <b>into</b> more open ground, they were hot <b>and</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> scratched, <b>and</b> they were also <b>no</b> longer certain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>in</b> which they were going. The banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream sank, as <b>it</b> reached <b>the</b> levels <b>and</b> became broader <b>and</b> shallower, wandering off towards <b>the</b> Marish <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River.
<br>   “Why, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Stock-brook!” said Pippin. “If we are going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> <b>get</b> back <b>on</b> <b>to</b> our course, we must cross at <b>once</b> <b>and</b> bear right.”
<br>   They waded <b>the</b> stream, <b>and</b> hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown <b>and</b> treeless, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side. Beyond that they came again <b>to</b> a belt <b>of</b> trees: tall oaks, for <b>the</b> most part, with here <b>and</b> there an elm tree <b>or</b> an ash. The ground <b>was</b> fairly level, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> little undergrowth; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> trees were loo close for them <b>to</b> see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards <b>in</b> sudden gusts <b>of</b> wind, <b>and</b> spots <b>of</b> rain began <b>to</b> fall from <b>the</b> overcast sky. Then <b>the</b> wind died away <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches <b>of</b> grass, <b>and</b> through thick drifts <b>of</b> old leaves; <b>and</b> all about them <b>the</b> rain pattered <b>and</b> trickled. They did not talk, <b>but</b> kept glancing back, <b>and</b> from side <b>to</b> side.
<br>   After half an hour Pippin said: “<b>I</b> hope we have not turned too much towards <b>the</b> south, <b>and</b> are not walking longwise through this wood! It <b>is</b> not a <b>very</b> broad belt –<b>I</b> should have said <b>no</b> more than a mile at <b>the</b> widest—<b>and</b> we ought <b>to</b> have been through <b>it</b> <b>by</b> now.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good our starting <b>to</b> go <b>in</b> zig-zags,” said Frodo. “That won’t mend matters. Let us keep <b>on</b> as we are going! <b>I</b> am not sure that <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> come out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open yet.”
<br>   They went <b>on</b> for perhaps another couple <b>of</b> miles. Then <b>the</b> sun gleamed out <b>of</b> ragged clouds again <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rain lessened. It <b>was</b> now past mid-day, <b>and</b> they felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ground at its feel <b>was</b> fairly dry <b>and</b> sheltered. When they came <b>to</b> make their meal, they found that <b>the</b> Elves <b>had</b> filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden <b>in</b> colour: <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> a honey made <b>of</b> many flowers, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, <b>and</b> snapping their fingers at rain, <b>and</b> at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.
<br>   Frodo propped his back against <b>the</b> tree-trunk, <b>and</b> closed his eyes. Sam <b>and</b> Pippin sat near, <b>and</b> they began <b>to</b> hum, <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> sing softly:
<br>   
<br>Ho! Ho! Ho! <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottle <b>I</b> go
<br>To heal my heart <b>and</b> drown my woe.
<br>Rain may fall <b>and</b> wind may blow,
<br>And many miles be still <b>to</b> go,
<br>But under a tall tree <b>I</b> will lie,
<br>And let <b>the</b> clouds go sailing <b>by</b>.
<br>   
<br>   Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang <b>to</b> his feet. A long-drawn wail came down <b>the</b> wind, like <b>the</b> cry <b>of</b> some evil <b>and</b> lonely creature. It rose <b>and</b> fell, <b>and</b> ended <b>on</b> a high piercing note. Even as they sat <b>and</b> stood, as if suddenly frozen, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> answered <b>by</b> another cry, fainter <b>and</b> further off, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> less chilling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blood. There <b>was</b> then a silence, broken only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves.
<br>   “And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think that <b>was</b>?” Pippin asked at last, trying <b>to</b> speak lightly, <b>but</b> quavering a little. “If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a bird, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one that <b>I</b> never heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire before.”
<br>   “It <b>was</b> not bird <b>or</b> beast,” said Frodo. “It <b>was</b> a call, <b>or</b> a signal—there were words <b>in</b> that cry, though <b>I</b> could not catch them. But <b>no</b> hobbit has such a voice.”
<br>   No more <b>was</b> said about <b>it</b>. They were all thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> one spoke <b>of</b> them. They were now reluctant either <b>to</b> stay <b>or</b> go <b>on</b>; <b>but</b> sooner <b>or</b> later they <b>had</b> got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across <b>the</b> open country <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best <b>to</b> go sooner <b>and</b> <b>in</b> daylight. In a few moments they <b>had</b> shouldered their packs again <b>and</b> were off.
<br>   Before long <b>the</b> wood came <b>to</b> a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them. They now saw that they <b>had</b>, <b>in</b> fact, turned too much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Away over <b>the</b> flats they could glimpse <b>the</b> low hill <b>of</b> Bucklebury across <b>the</b> River, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> now <b>to</b> their left. Creeping cautiously out from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, they set off across <b>the</b> open as quickly as they could.
<br>   At first they felt afraid, away from <b>the</b> shelter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. Far back behind them stood <b>the</b> high place where they <b>had</b> breakfasted. Frodo half expected <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> small distant figure <b>of</b> a horseman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge dark against <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> one. The sun escaping from <b>the</b> breaking clouds, as <b>it</b> sank towards <b>the</b> hills they <b>had</b> left, <b>was</b> now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But <b>the</b> land became steadily more tame <b>and</b> well-ordered. Soon they came <b>into</b> well-tended fields <b>and</b> meadows: there were hedges <b>and</b> gates <b>and</b> dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet <b>and</b> peaceful, just an ordinary corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River grew nearer; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders began <b>to</b> seem like phantoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods now left far behind.
<br>   They passed along <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a huge turnip-field, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> a stout gate. Beyond <b>it</b> a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump <b>of</b> trees. Pippin stopped.
<br>   “<b>I</b> know these fields <b>and</b> this gate!” he said. “This <b>is</b> Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s his farm away there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees.”
<br>   “One trouble after another!” said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin <b>had</b> declared <b>the</b> lane <b>was</b> <b>the</b> slot leading <b>to</b> a dragon’s den. The others looked at him <b>in</b> surprise.
<br>   “What’s wrong with old Maggot?” asked Pippin. “He’s a good friend <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> Brandy bucks. Of course he’s a terror <b>to</b> trespassers, <b>and</b> keeps ferocious dogs—<b>but</b> after all, folk down here are near <b>the</b> border <b>and</b> have <b>to</b> be more <b>on</b> their guard.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know,” said Frodo. “But all <b>the</b> same,” he added with a shamefaced laugh, “<b>I</b> am terrified <b>of</b> him <b>and</b> his dogs. <b>I</b> have avoided his farm for years <b>and</b> years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a youngster at Brandy Hall. On <b>the</b> last occasion he beat me, <b>and</b> then took me <b>and</b> showed me <b>to</b> his dogs. “See, lads,” he said, “next time this young varmint sets foot <b>on</b> my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!” They chased me all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. <b>I</b> have never got over <b>the</b> fright—though <b>I</b> daresay <b>the</b> beasts knew their business <b>and</b> would not really have touched me.”
<br>   Pippin laughed. “Well, <b>it</b>’s time you made <b>it</b> up. Especially if you are coming back <b>to</b> live <b>in</b> Buckland. Old Maggot <b>is</b> really a stout fellow—if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let’s <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane <b>and</b> then we shan’t be trespassing. If we meet him, <b>I</b>’ll <b>do</b> <b>the</b> talking. He <b>is</b> a friend <b>of</b> Merry’s, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used <b>to</b> come here with him a good deal at one time.”
<br>   They went along <b>the</b> lane, until they saw <b>the</b> thatched roofs <b>of</b> a large house <b>and</b> farm-buildings peeping out among <b>the</b> trees ahead. The Maggots, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Puddifoots <b>of</b> Stock, <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, were house-dwellers; <b>and</b> this farm <b>was</b> stoutly built <b>of</b> brick <b>and</b> <b>had</b> a high wall all round <b>it</b>. There <b>was</b> a wide wooden gate opening out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane.
<br>   Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying <b>and</b> barking broke out, <b>and</b> a loud voice <b>was</b> heard shouting: “Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come <b>on</b>, lads!”
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam stopped dead, <b>but</b> Pippin walked <b>on</b> a few paces. The gate opened <b>and</b> three huge dogs came pelting out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane, <b>and</b> dashed towards <b>the</b> travellers, barking fiercely. They took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> Pippin; <b>but</b> Sam shrank against <b>the</b> wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, <b>and</b> snarled if he moved. The largest <b>and</b> most ferocious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three halted <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> Frodo, bristling <b>and</b> growling.
<br>   Through <b>the</b> gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. “Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> may you be wanting?” he asked.
<br>   “Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!” said Pippin.
<br>   The farmer looked at him closely. “Well, if <b>it</b> isn’t Master Pippin—Mr. Peregrin Took, <b>I</b> should say!” he cried, changing from a scowl <b>to</b> a grin. “It’s a long time since <b>I</b> saw you round here. It’s lucky for you that <b>I</b> know you. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just going out <b>to</b> set my dogs <b>on</b> any strangers. There are some funny things going <b>on</b> today. Of course, we <b>do</b> <b>get</b> queer folk wandering <b>in</b> these parts at times. Too near <b>the</b> River,” he said, shaking his head. “But this fellow <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most outlandish <b>I</b> have ever set eyes <b>on</b>. He won’t cross my land <b>without</b> leave a second time, not if <b>I</b> can stop <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “What fellow <b>do</b> you mean?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “Then you haven’t seen him?” said <b>the</b> farmer. “He went up <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> causeway not a long while back. He <b>was</b> a funny customer <b>and</b> asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come along inside, <b>and</b> we’ll pass <b>the</b> news more comfortable. <b>I</b>’ve a drop <b>of</b> good ale <b>on</b> tap, if you <b>and</b> your friends are willing, Mr. Took.”
<br>   It seemed plain that <b>the</b> farmer would tell them more, if allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his own time <b>and</b> fashion, so they all accepted <b>the</b> invitation. “What about <b>the</b> dogs?” asked Frodo anxiously.
<br>   The farmer laughed. “They won’t harm you—not unless <b>I</b> tell “em <b>to</b>. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!” he cried. “Heel, Wolf!” To <b>the</b> relief <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> Sam, <b>the</b> dogs walked away <b>and</b> let them go free.
<br>   Pippin introduced <b>the</b> other two <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmer. “Mr. Frodo Baggins,” he said. “You may not remember him, <b>but</b> he used <b>to</b> live at Brandy Hall.” At <b>the</b> name Baggins <b>the</b> farmer started, <b>and</b> gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo <b>thought</b> that <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> stolen mushrooms <b>had</b> been aroused, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> dogs would be told <b>to</b> see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arm.
<br>   “Well, if that isn’t queerer than ever?” he exclaimed. “Mr. Baggins <b>is</b> <b>it</b>? Come inside! We must have a talk.”
<br>   They went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> farmer’s kitchen, <b>and</b> sat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer <b>in</b> a huge jug, <b>and</b> filled four large mugs. It <b>was</b> a good brew, <b>and</b> Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing <b>the</b> Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He <b>had</b> a natural mistrust <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> also he <b>was</b> not disposed <b>to</b> be quick friends with anyone who <b>had</b> beaten his master, however long ago.
<br>   After a few remarks about <b>the</b> weather <b>and</b> <b>the</b> agricultural prospects (which were <b>no</b> worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug <b>and</b> looked at them all <b>in</b> turn.
<br>   “Now, Mr. Peregrin,” he said, “where might you be coming from, <b>and</b> where might you be going <b>to</b>? Were you coming <b>to</b> visit” me? For, if so, you <b>had</b> gone past my gate <b>without</b> my seeing you.”
<br>   “Well, <b>no</b>,” answered Pippin. “To tell you <b>the</b> truth, since you have guessed <b>it</b>, we got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane from <b>the</b> other end: we <b>had</b> come over your fields. But that <b>was</b> quite <b>by</b> accident. We lost our way <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, back near Woodhall, trying <b>to</b> take a short cut <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry.”
<br>   “If you were <b>in</b> a hurry, <b>the</b> road would have served you better,” said <b>the</b> farmer. “But <b>I</b> wasn’t worrying about that. You have leave <b>to</b> walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins—though <b>I</b> daresay you still like mushrooms.” He laughed. “Ah yes, <b>I</b> recognized <b>the</b> name. <b>I</b> recollect <b>the</b> time when young Frodo Baggins <b>was</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst young rascals <b>of</b> Buckland. But <b>it</b> wasn’t mushrooms <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b>. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just heard <b>the</b> name Baggins before you turned up. What <b>do</b> you think that funny customer asked me?”
<br>   They waited anxiously for him <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. “Well,” <b>the</b> farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, “he came riding <b>on</b> a big black horse <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> gate, which happened <b>to</b> be open, <b>and</b> right up <b>to</b> my door. All black he <b>was</b> himself, too, <b>and</b> cloaked <b>and</b> hooded up, as if he did not want <b>to</b> be known. “Now <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire can he want?” <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> myself. We don’t see many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk over <b>the</b> border; <b>and</b> anyway <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never heard <b>of</b> any like this black fellow.
<br>   ““Good-day <b>to</b> you!” <b>I</b> says, going out <b>to</b> him. “This lane don’t lead anywhere, <b>and</b> wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road.” <b>I</b> didn’t like <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> him; <b>and</b> when Grip came out, he took one sniff <b>and</b> let out a yelp as if he <b>had</b> been slung: he put down his tail <b>and</b> bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.
<br>   ““<b>I</b> come from yonder,” he said, slow <b>and</b> stiff-like, pointing back west, over my fields, if you please. “Have you seen Baggins?” he asked <b>in</b> a queer voice, <b>and</b> bent down towards me. <b>I</b> could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt a sort <b>of</b> shiver down my back. But <b>I</b> did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.
<br>   ““Be off!” <b>I</b> said. “There are <b>no</b> Bagginses here. You’re <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. You <b>had</b> better go back west <b>to</b> Hobbiton—<b>but</b> you can go <b>by</b> road this time.”
<br>   ““Baggins has left,” he answered <b>in</b> a whisper. “He <b>is</b> coming. He <b>is</b> not far away. <b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> find him. If he passes will you tell me? <b>I</b> will come back with gold.”
<br>   ““No you won’t,” <b>I</b> said. “You’ll go back where you belong, double quick. <b>I</b> give you one minute before <b>I</b> call all my dogs.”
<br>   “He gave a sort <b>of</b> hiss. It might have been laughing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> jumped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way only just <b>in</b> time. <b>I</b> called <b>the</b> dogs, <b>but</b> he swung off, <b>and</b> rode through <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> lane towards <b>the</b> causeway like a bolt <b>of</b> thunder. What <b>do</b> you think <b>of</b> that?”
<br>   Frodo sat for a moment looking at <b>the</b> fire, <b>but</b> his only <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> how <b>on</b> earth would they reach <b>the</b> Ferry. “<b>I</b> don’t know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think,” he said at last.
<br>   “Then <b>I</b>’ll tell you <b>what</b> <b>to</b> think,” said Maggot. “You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there.” Sam stirred <b>in</b> his chair, <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> farmer with an unfriendly eye. “But you were always a reckless lad. When <b>I</b> heard you <b>had</b> left <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>and</b> gone off <b>to</b> that old Mr. Bilbo, <b>I</b> said that you were going <b>to</b> find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes <b>of</b> those strange doings <b>of</b> Mr. Bilbo’s. His money <b>was</b> got <b>in</b> some strange fashion <b>in</b> foreign parts, they say. Maybe there <b>is</b> some that want <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> has become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold <b>and</b> jewels that he buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Hobbiton, as <b>I</b> hear?”
<br>   Frodo said <b>nothing</b>: <b>the</b> shrewd guesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer were rather disconcerting.
<br>   “Well, Mr. Frodo,” Maggot went <b>on</b>, “<b>I</b>’m glad that you’ve <b>had</b> <b>the</b> sense <b>to</b> come back <b>to</b> Buckland. My advice <b>is</b>: stay there! And don’t <b>get</b> mixed up with these outlandish folk. You’ll have friends <b>in</b> these parts. If any <b>of</b> these black fellows come after you again, <b>I</b>’ll deal with them. <b>I</b>’ll say you’re dead, <b>or</b> have left <b>the</b> Shire, <b>or</b> anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not <b>it</b> <b>is</b> old Mr. Bilbo they want news <b>of</b>.”
<br>   “Maybe you’re right,” said Frodo, avoiding <b>the</b> farmer’s eye <b>and</b> staring at <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. “Well, <b>I</b> see you have ideas <b>of</b> your own,” he said. “It <b>is</b> as plain as my nose that <b>no</b> accident brought you <b>and</b> that rider here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same afternoon; <b>and</b> maybe my news <b>was</b> <b>no</b> great news <b>to</b> you, after all. <b>I</b> am not asking you <b>to</b> tell me anything you have a mind <b>to</b> keep <b>to</b> yourself; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> see you are <b>in</b> some kind <b>of</b> trouble. Perhaps you are thinking <b>it</b> won’t be too easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry <b>without</b> being caught?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking so,” said Frodo. “But we have got <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> <b>get</b> there; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> won’t be done <b>by</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>and</b> thinking. So <b>I</b> am afraid we must be going. Thank you <b>very</b> much indeed for your kindness! <b>I</b>’ve been <b>in</b> terror <b>of</b> you <b>and</b> your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b>. It’s a pity: for <b>I</b>’ve missed a good friend. And now <b>I</b>’m sorry <b>to</b> leave so soon. But <b>I</b>’ll come back, perhaps, one day—if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a chance.”
<br>   “You’ll be welcome when you come,” said Maggot. “But now <b>I</b>’ve a notion. It’s near sundown already, <b>and</b> we are going <b>to</b> have our supper; for we mostly go <b>to</b> bed soon after <b>the</b> Sun. If you <b>and</b> Mr. Peregrin <b>and</b> all could stay <b>and</b> have a bite with us, we would be pleased!”
<br>   “And so should we!” said Frodo. “But we must be going at <b>once</b>, <b>I</b>’m afraid. Even now <b>it</b> will be dark before we can reach <b>the</b> Ferry.”
<br>   “Ah! <b>but</b> wait a minute! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> say: after a bit <b>of</b> supper, <b>I</b>’ll gel out a small waggon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>’ll drive you all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. That will save you a good step, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> might also save you trouble <b>of</b> another sort.”
<br>   Frodo now accepted <b>the</b> invitation gratefully, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> relief <b>of</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam. The sun <b>was</b> already behind <b>the</b> western hills, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>was</b> failing. Two <b>of</b> Maggot’s sons <b>and</b> his three daughters came <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> a generous supper <b>was</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> large table. The kitchen <b>was</b> lit with candles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>was</b> mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out. One <b>or</b> two other hobbits belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farm-household came <b>in</b>. In a short while fourteen sat down <b>to</b> eat. There <b>was</b> beer <b>in</b> plenty, <b>and</b> a mighty dish <b>of</b> mushrooms <b>and</b> bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> gnawed rinds <b>and</b> cracked bones.
<br>   When they <b>had</b> finished, <b>the</b> farmer <b>and</b> his sons went out with a lantern <b>and</b> got <b>the</b> waggon ready. It <b>was</b> dark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard, when <b>the</b> guests came out. They threw their packs <b>on</b> board <b>and</b> climbed <b>in</b>. The farmer sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driving-seat, <b>and</b> whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> open door.
<br>   “You be careful <b>of</b> yourself. Maggot!” <b>she</b> called. “Don’t go arguing with any foreigners, <b>and</b> come straight back!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will!” said he, <b>and</b> drove out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate. There <b>was</b> now <b>no</b> breath <b>of</b> wind stirring; <b>the</b> night <b>was</b> still <b>and</b> quiet, <b>and</b> a chill <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. They went <b>without</b> lights <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> slowly. After a mile <b>or</b> two <b>the</b> lane came <b>to</b> an end, crossing a deep dike, <b>and</b> climbing a short slope up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high-banked causeway.
<br>   Maggot got down <b>and</b> took a good look either way, north <b>and</b> south, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> could be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> not a sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> still air. Thin strands <b>of</b> river-mist were hanging above <b>the</b> dikes, <b>and</b> crawling over <b>the</b> fields.
<br>   “It’s going <b>to</b> be thick,” said Maggot; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b>’ll not light my lantern till <b>I</b> turn for home. We’ll hear anything <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road long before we meet <b>it</b> tonight.”
<br>   It <b>was</b> five miles <b>or</b> more from Maggot’s lane <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, <b>but</b> their ears were strained for any sound above <b>the</b> creak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slow clop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ponies” hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail <b>to</b> Frodo. Beside him Pippin <b>was</b> nodding towards sleep; <b>but</b> Sam <b>was</b> staring forwards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rising fog.
<br>   They reached <b>the</b> entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ferry lane at last. It <b>was</b> marked <b>by</b> two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up <b>on</b> their right. Farmer Maggot drew <b>in</b> his ponies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waggon creaked <b>to</b> a halt. They were just <b>beginning</b> lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard <b>what</b> they <b>had</b> all been dreading: hoofs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road ahead. The sound <b>was</b> coming towards them.
<br>   Maggot jumped down <b>and</b> stood holding <b>the</b> ponies” heads, <b>and</b> peering forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came <b>the</b> approaching rider. The fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hoofs sounded loud <b>in</b> <b>the</b> still, foggy air.
<br>   “You’d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam anxiously. “You <b>get</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waggon <b>and</b> cover up with blankets, <b>and</b> we’ll send this rider <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rightabouts!” He climbed out <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> farmer’s side. Black Riders would have <b>to</b> ride over him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> near <b>the</b> waggon.
<br>   Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider <b>was</b> nearly <b>on</b> them.
<br>   “Hallo there!” called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They <b>thought</b> they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mist, a yard <b>or</b> two ahead. “Now then!” said <b>the</b> farmer, throwing <b>the</b> reins <b>to</b> Sam <b>and</b> striding forward. “Don’t you come a step nearer! What <b>do</b> you want, <b>and</b> where are you going?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?” said a muffled voice—<b>but</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>was</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern <b>was</b> uncovered, <b>and</b> its light fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> astonished face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> farmer.
<br>   “Mr. Merry!” he cried.
<br>   “Yes, <b>of</b> course! Who did you think <b>it</b> <b>was</b>?” said Merry coming forward. As he came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist <b>and</b> their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly <b>to</b> diminish <b>to</b> ordinary hobbit-size. He <b>was</b> riding a pony, <b>and</b> a scarf <b>was</b> swathed round his neck <b>and</b> over his chin <b>to</b> keep out <b>the</b> fog.
<br>   Frodo sprang out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waggon <b>to</b> greet him. “So there you are at last!” said Merry. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> wonder if you would turn up at all today, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just going back <b>to</b> supper. When <b>it</b> grew foggy <b>I</b> came across <b>and</b> rode up towards Stock <b>to</b> see if you <b>had</b> fallen <b>in</b> any ditches. But <b>I</b>’m blest if <b>I</b> know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck-pond?”
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> caught “em trespassing,” said <b>the</b> farmer, “<b>and</b> nearly set my dogs <b>on</b> “em; <b>but</b> they’ll tell you all <b>the</b> story, <b>I</b>’ve <b>no</b> doubt. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry <b>and</b> Mr. Frodo <b>and</b> all, <b>I</b>’d best be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with <b>the</b> night getting thick.”
<br>   He backed <b>the</b> waggon <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lane <b>and</b> turned <b>it</b>. “Well, good night <b>to</b> you all,” he said. “It’s been a queer day, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake. But all’s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors. <b>I</b>’ll not deny that <b>I</b>’ll be glad now when <b>I</b> <b>do</b>.” He lit his lanterns, <b>and</b> got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under <b>the</b> seat. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> nearly forgetting,” he said. “Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with <b>her</b> compliments.” He handed <b>it</b> down <b>and</b> moved off, followed <b>by</b> a chorus <b>of</b> thanks <b>and</b> good-nights.
<br>   They watched <b>the</b> pale rings <b>of</b> light round his lanterns as they dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from <b>the</b> covered basket he held, <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> mushrooms <b>was</b> rising.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 5
<br>A CONSPIRACY UNMASKED
<br>
<br>   “Now we <b>had</b> better <b>get</b> home ourselves,” said Merry. There’s something funny about all this, <b>I</b> see; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> must wait till we <b>get</b> <b>in</b>.”
<br>   They turned down <b>the</b> Ferry lane, which <b>was</b> straight <b>and</b> well-kept <b>and</b> edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> brought them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river-<b>bank</b>, where there <b>was</b> a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat <b>was</b> moored beside <b>it</b>. The white bollards near <b>the</b> water’s edge glimmered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> two lamps <b>on</b> high posts. Behind them <b>the</b> mists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flat fields were now above <b>the</b> hedges; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> water before them <b>was</b> dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among <b>the</b> reeds <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. There seemed <b>to</b> be less fog <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side.
<br>   Merry led <b>the</b> pony over a gangway <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ferry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow <b>and</b> broad before them. On <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>was</b> steep, <b>and</b> up <b>it</b> a winding path climbed from <b>the</b> further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up <b>the</b> Buck Hill; <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, through stray shrouds <b>of</b> mist, shone many round windows, yellow <b>and</b> red. They were <b>the</b> windows <b>of</b> Brandy Hall, <b>the</b> ancient home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks.
<br>   Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oldbuck family, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marish <b>or</b> indeed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>had</b> crossed <b>the</b> river, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> original boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land eastwards. He built (<b>and</b> excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name <b>to</b> Brandybuck, <b>and</b> settled down <b>to</b> become master <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> virtually a small independent country. His family grew <b>and</b> grew, <b>and</b> after his days continued <b>to</b> grow, until Brandy Hall occupied <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low hill, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> three large front-doors, many side-doors, <b>and</b> about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks <b>and</b> their numerous dependants then began <b>to</b> burrow, <b>and</b> later <b>to</b> build, all round about. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest, a sort <b>of</b> colony from <b>the</b> Shire. Its chief village <b>was</b> Bucklebury, clustering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>and</b> slopes behind Brandy Hall.
<br>   The people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Marish were friendly with <b>the</b> Bucklanders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall (as <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandybuck family <b>was</b> called) <b>was</b> still acknowledged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> farmers between Stock <b>and</b> Rushey. But most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Shire regarded <b>the</b> Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as <b>it</b> were. Though, as a matter <b>of</b> fact, they were not <b>very</b> different from <b>the</b> other hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Farthings. Except <b>in</b> one point: they were fond <b>of</b> boats, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them could swim.
<br>   Their land <b>was</b> originally unprotected from <b>the</b> East; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> that side they <b>had</b> built a hedge: <b>the</b> High Hay. It <b>had</b> been planted many generations ago, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> now thick <b>and</b> tail, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> constantly tended. It ran all <b>the</b> way from Brandywine Bridge, <b>in</b> a big loop curving away from <b>the</b> river, <b>to</b> Haysend (where <b>the</b> Withywindle flowed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end <b>to</b> end. But, <b>of</b> course, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a complete protection. The Forest drew close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hedge <b>in</b> many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, <b>and</b> that also <b>was</b> not usual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   The ferry-boat moved slowly across <b>the</b> water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party who <b>had</b> not been over <b>the</b> river before. He <b>had</b> a strange feeling as <b>the</b> slow gurgling stream slipped <b>by</b>: his old life lay behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mists, dark adventure lay <b>in</b> front. He scratched his head, <b>and</b> for a moment <b>had</b> a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone <b>on</b> living quietly at Bag End.
<br>   The four hobbits stepped off <b>the</b> ferry. Merry <b>was</b> tying <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> Pippin <b>was</b> already leading <b>the</b> pony up <b>the</b> path, when Sam (who <b>had</b> been looking back, as if <b>to</b> take farewell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire) said <b>in</b> a hoarse whisper:
<br>   “Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?”
<br>   On <b>the</b> far stage, under <b>the</b> distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: <b>it</b> looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> move <b>and</b> sway this way <b>and</b> that, as if searching <b>the</b> ground. It then crawled, <b>or</b> went crouching, back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom beyond <b>the</b> lamps.
<br>   “What <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>is</b> that?” exclaimed Merry.
<br>   “Something that <b>is</b> following us,” said Frodo. “But don’t ask any more now! Let’s <b>get</b> away at <b>once</b>!” They hurried up <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, <b>but</b> when they looked back <b>the</b> far shore <b>was</b> shrouded <b>in</b> mist, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> could be seen.
<br>   “Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west-<b>bank</b>!” said Frodo. “Can horses cross <b>the</b> river?”
<br>   “They can go twenty miles north <b>to</b> Brandywine Bridge—<b>or</b> they might swim,” answered Merry. “Though <b>I</b> never heard <b>of</b> any horse swimming <b>the</b> Brandywine. But <b>what</b> have horses <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it</b>?” <b>I</b>’ll tell you later. Let’s <b>get</b> indoors <b>and</b> then we can talk.”
<br>   “All right! You <b>and</b> Pippin know your way; so <b>I</b>’ll just ride <b>on</b> <b>and</b> tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We’ll see about supper <b>and</b> things.”
<br>   “We <b>had</b> our supper early with Farmer Maggot,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> we could <b>do</b> with another.”
<br>   “You shall have <b>it</b>! Give me that basket!” said Merry, <b>and</b> rode ahead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   It <b>was</b> some distance from <b>the</b> Brandywine <b>to</b> Frodo’s new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill <b>and</b> Brandy Hall <b>on</b> their left, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> Bucklebury struck <b>the</b> main road <b>of</b> Buckland that ran south from <b>the</b> Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came <b>to</b> a lane opening <b>on</b> their right. This they followed for a couple <b>of</b> miles as <b>it</b> climbed up <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> country.
<br>   At last they came <b>to</b> a narrow gate <b>in</b> a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark: <b>it</b> stood back from <b>the</b> lane <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> a wide circle <b>of</b> lawn surrounded <b>by</b> a belt <b>of</b> low trees inside <b>the</b> outer hedge. Frodo <b>had</b> chosen <b>it</b>, because <b>it</b> stood <b>in</b> an out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, <b>and</b> there were <b>no</b> other dwellings close <b>by</b>. You could <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>without</b> being noticed. It <b>had</b> been built a long while before <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks, for <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> guests, <b>or</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family that wished <b>to</b> escape from <b>the</b> crowded life <b>of</b> Brandy Hall for a time. It <b>was</b> an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long <b>and</b> low, with <b>no</b> upper storey; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a roof <b>of</b> turf, round windows, <b>and</b> a large round door.
<br>   As they walked lip <b>the</b> green path from <b>the</b> gate <b>no</b> light <b>was</b> visible; <b>the</b> windows were dark <b>and</b> shuttered. Frodo knocked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> Fatty Bolger opened <b>it</b>. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped <b>in</b> quickly <b>and</b> shut themselves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light inside. They were <b>in</b> a wide hall with doors <b>on</b> either side; <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> them a passage ran back down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house.
<br>   “Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?” asked Merry coming up <b>the</b> passage. “We have done our best <b>in</b> a short time <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> look like home. After all Fatty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> only got here with <b>the</b> last cart-load yesterday.”
<br>   Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many <b>of</b> his own favourite things—<b>or</b> Bilbo’s things (they reminded him sharply <b>of</b> him <b>in</b> their new selling)—were arranged as nearly as possible as they <b>had</b> been at Bag End. It <b>was</b> a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; <b>and</b> he found himself wishing that he <b>was</b> really coming here <b>to</b> settle down <b>in</b> quiet retirement. It seemed unfair <b>to</b> have put his friends <b>to</b> all this trouble; <b>and</b> he wondered again how he <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> news <b>to</b> them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at <b>once</b>. Yet that would have <b>to</b> be done that <b>very</b> night, before they all went <b>to</b> bed.
<br>   “It’s delightful!” he said with an effort. “<b>I</b> hardly feel that <b>I</b> have moved at all.”
<br>   The travellers hung up their cloaks, <b>and</b> piled their packs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Merry led them down <b>the</b> passage <b>and</b> threw open a door at <b>the</b> far end. Firelight came out, <b>and</b> a puff <b>of</b> steam.
<br>   “A bath!” cried Pippin. “O blessed Meriadoc!”
<br>   “Which order shall we go <b>in</b>?” said Frodo. “Eldest first, <b>or</b> quickest first? You’ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.”
<br>   “Trust me <b>to</b> arrange things better than that!” said Merry. “We can’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are three tubs, <b>and</b> a copper full <b>of</b> boiling water. There are also towels, mats <b>and</b> soap. Get inside, <b>and</b> be quick!”
<br>   Merry <b>and</b> Fatty went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage, <b>and</b> busied themselves with <b>the</b> final preparations for a late supper. Snatches <b>of</b> competing songs came from <b>the</b> bathroom mixed with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> splashing <b>and</b> wallowing. The voice <b>of</b> Pippin <b>was</b> suddenly lifted up above <b>the</b> others <b>in</b> one <b>of</b> Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs.
<br>   
<br>Sing hey! for <b>the</b> bath at close <b>of</b> day
<br>that washes <b>the</b> weary mud away!
<br>A loon <b>is</b> he that will not sing:
<br>O! Water Hot <b>is</b> a noble thing!
<br>
<br>O! Sweet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> falling rain,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> brook that leaps from hill <b>to</b> plain;
<br><b>but</b> better than rain <b>or</b> rippling streams
<br><b>is</b> Water Hot that smokes <b>and</b> steams.
<br>
<br>O! Water cold we may pour at need
<br>down a thirsty throat <b>and</b> be glad indeed;
<br><b>but</b> better <b>is</b> Beer, if drink we lack,
<br><b>and</b> Water Hot poured down <b>the</b> back.
<br>
<br>O! Water <b>is</b> fair that leaps <b>on</b> high
<br><b>in</b> a fountain white beneath <b>the</b> sky;
<br><b>but</b> never did fountain sound so sweet
<br>as splashing Hot Water with my feet!
<br>   
<br>   There <b>was</b> a terrific splash, <b>and</b> a shout <b>of</b> Whoa! from Frodo. It appeared that a lot <b>of</b> Pippin’s bath <b>had</b> imitated a fountain <b>and</b> leaped <b>on</b> high.
<br>   Merry went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door: “What about supper <b>and</b> beer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> throat?” he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.
<br>   “There’s so much water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air that <b>I</b>’m coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>to</b> finish,” he said.
<br>   “Lawks!” said Merry, looking <b>in</b>. The stone floor <b>was</b> swimming. “You ought <b>to</b> mop all that up before you <b>get</b> anything <b>to</b> eat. Peregrin,” he said. “Hurry up, <b>or</b> we shan’t wait for you.”
<br>   They <b>had</b> supper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>on</b> a table near <b>the</b> fire. “<b>I</b> suppose you three won’t want mushrooms again?” said Fredegar <b>without</b> much hope.
<br>   “Yes we shall!” cried Pippin.
<br>   “They’re mine!” said Frodo. “Given <b>to</b> me <b>by</b> Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers” wives. Take your greedy hands away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>’ll serve them.”
<br>   Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even <b>the</b> greediest likings <b>of</b> Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo’s long expeditions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> renowned fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marish, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wrath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injured Maggot. On this occasion there <b>was</b> plenty for all, even according <b>to</b> hobbit standards. There were also many other things <b>to</b> follow, <b>and</b> when they <b>had</b> finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh <b>of</b> content. They pushed back <b>the</b> table, <b>and</b> drew chairs round <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   “We’ll clear up later,” said Merry. “Now tell me all about <b>it</b>! <b>I</b> guess that you have been <b>having</b> adventures, which <b>was</b> not quite fair <b>without</b> me. <b>I</b> want a full account; <b>and</b> most <b>of</b> all <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> matter with old Maggot, <b>and</b> why he spoke <b>to</b> me like that. He sounded almost as if he <b>was</b> scared, if that <b>is</b> possible.”
<br>   “We have all been scared,” said Pippin after a pause, <b>in</b> which Frodo stared at <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> did not speak. “You would have been, too, if you <b>had</b> been chased for two days <b>by</b> Black Riders.”
<br>   “And <b>what</b> are they?”
<br>   “Black figures riding <b>on</b> black horses,” answered Pippin. “If Frodo won’t talk, <b>I</b> will tell you <b>the</b> whole tale from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>.” He then gave a full account <b>of</b> their journey from <b>the</b> time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods <b>and</b> exclamations. Frodo remained silent.
<br>   “<b>I</b> should think you were making <b>it</b> all up,” said Merry, “if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not seen that black shape <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing-stage—<b>and</b> heard <b>the</b> queer sound <b>in</b> Maggot’s voice. What <b>do</b> you make <b>of</b> <b>it</b> all, Frodo?”
<br>   “Cousin Frodo has been <b>very</b> close,” said Pippin. “But <b>the</b> time has come for him <b>to</b> open out. So far we have been given <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> than Farmer Maggot’s guess that <b>it</b> has something <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with old Bilbo’s treasure.”
<br>   “That <b>was</b> only a guess,” said Frodo hastily. “Maggot does not know anything.”
<br>   “Old Maggot <b>is</b> a shrewd fellow,” said Merry. “A lot goes <b>on</b> behind his round face that does not come out <b>in</b> his talk. <b>I</b>’ve heard that he used <b>to</b> go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest at one time, <b>and</b> he has <b>the</b> reputation <b>of</b> knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good <b>or</b> bad.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think,” answered Frodo slowly, “that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good guess, as far as <b>it</b> goes. There <b>is</b> a connexion with Bilbo’s old adventures, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Riders are looking, <b>or</b> perhaps one ought <b>to</b> say searching, for him <b>or</b> for me. <b>I</b> also fear, if you want <b>to</b> know, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> joke at all; <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> am not safe here <b>or</b> anywhere else.” He looked round at <b>the</b> windows <b>and</b> walls, as if he <b>was</b> afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him <b>in</b> silence, <b>and</b> exchanged meaning glances among themselves.
<br>   “It’s coming out <b>in</b> a minute,” whispered Pippin <b>to</b> Merry. Merry nodded.
<br>   “Well!” said Frodo at last, <b>sitting</b> up <b>and</b> straightening his back, as if he <b>had</b> made a decision. “<b>I</b> can’t keep <b>it</b> dark any longer. <b>I</b> have got something <b>to</b> tell you all. But <b>I</b> don’t know quite how <b>to</b> begin.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> could help you,” said Merry quietly, “<b>by</b> telling you some <b>of</b> <b>it</b> myself.”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. “Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don’t know how <b>to</b> say good-bye. You meant <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire, <b>of</b> course. But danger has come <b>on</b> you sooner than you expected, <b>and</b> now you are making up your mind <b>to</b> go at <b>once</b>. And you don’t want <b>to</b>. We are <b>very</b> sorry for you.”
<br>   Frodo opened his mouth <b>and</b> shut <b>it</b> again. His look <b>of</b> surprise <b>was</b> so comical that they laughed. “Dear old Frodo!” said Pippin. “Did you really think you <b>had</b> thrown dust <b>in</b> all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful <b>or</b> clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> saying farewell <b>to</b> all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: “Shall <b>I</b> ever look down <b>into</b> that valley again, <b>I</b> wonder”, <b>and</b> things like that. And pretending that you <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your money, <b>and</b> actually selling your beloved Bag End <b>to</b> those Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.”
<br>   “Good heavens!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been both careful <b>and</b> clever. <b>I</b> don’t know <b>what</b> Gandalf would say. Is all <b>the</b> Shire discussing my departure then?”
<br>   “Oh <b>no</b>!” said Merry. “Don’t worry about that! The secret won’t keep for long, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> at present <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, <b>I</b> think, only known <b>to</b> us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, <b>and</b> are often with you. We can usually guess <b>what</b> you are thinking. <b>I</b> knew Bilbo, too. To tell you <b>the</b> truth, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been watching you rather closely ever since he left. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you would go after him sooner <b>or</b> later; indeed <b>I</b> expected you <b>to</b> go sooner, <b>and</b> lately we have been <b>very</b> anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us <b>the</b> slip, <b>and</b> go off suddenly, all <b>on</b> your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, <b>and</b> done a good deal <b>of</b> planning <b>on</b> our own account. You are not going <b>to</b> escape so easily!”
<br>   “But <b>I</b> must go,” said Frodo. “It cannot be helped, dear friends. It <b>is</b> wretched for us all, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> your trying <b>to</b> keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not hinder me!”
<br>   “You <b>do</b> not understand!” said Pippin. “You must go—<b>and</b> therefore we must, too. Merry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are coming with you. Sam <b>is</b> an excellent fellow, <b>and</b> would jump down a dragon’s throat <b>to</b> save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; <b>but</b> you will need more than one companion <b>in</b> your dangerous adventure.”
<br>   “My dear <b>and</b> most beloved hobbits!” said Frodo deeply moved. “But <b>I</b> could not allow <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> decided that long ago, too. You speak <b>of</b> danger, <b>but</b> you <b>do</b> not understand. This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> treasure-hunt, <b>no</b> there-<b>and</b>-back journey. <b>I</b> am flying from deadly peril <b>into</b> deadly peril.”
<br>   “Of course we understand,” said Merry firmly. “That <b>is</b> why we have decided <b>to</b> come. We know <b>the</b> Ring <b>is</b> <b>no</b> laughing-matter; <b>but</b> we are going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our best <b>to</b> help you against <b>the</b> Enemy.”
<br>   “The Ring!” said Frodo, now completely amazed.
<br>   “Yes, <b>the</b> Ring,” said Merry. “My dear old hobbit, you don’t allow for <b>the</b> inquisitiveness <b>of</b> friends. <b>I</b> have known about <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring for years—before Bilbo went away, <b>in</b> fact; <b>but</b> since he obviously regarded <b>it</b> as secret, <b>I</b> kept <b>the</b> knowledge <b>in</b> my head, until we formed our conspiracy. <b>I</b> did not know Bilbo, <b>of</b> course, as well as <b>I</b> know you; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too young, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> also more careful—<b>but</b> he <b>was</b> not careful enough. If you want <b>to</b> know how <b>I</b> first found out, <b>I</b> will tell you.”
<br>   “Go <b>on</b>!” said Frodo faintly.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year before <b>the</b> Party, <b>I</b> happened <b>to</b> be walking along <b>the</b> road, when <b>I</b> saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance <b>the</b> S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, <b>and</b> then hey presto! he vanished. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so startled that <b>I</b> hardly <b>had</b> <b>the</b> wits <b>to</b> hide myself <b>in</b> a more ordinary fashion; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> got through <b>the</b> hedge <b>and</b> walked along <b>the</b> field inside. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> peeping through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> road, after <b>the</b> S.-B.s <b>had</b> passed, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. <b>I</b> caught a glint <b>of</b> gold as he put something back <b>in</b> his trouser-pocket.
<br>   “After that <b>I</b> kept my eyes open. In fact, <b>I</b> confess that <b>I</b> spied. But you must admit that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> intriguing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only <b>in</b> my teens. <b>I</b> must be <b>the</b> only one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen <b>the</b> old fellow’s secret <b>book</b>.”
<br>   “You have read his <b>book</b>!” cried Frodo. “Good heavens above! Is <b>nothing</b> safe?”
<br>   “Not too safe, <b>I</b> should say,” said Merry. “But <b>I</b> have only <b>had</b> one rapid glance, <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b>. He never left <b>the</b> <b>book</b> about. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> became <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> should like another look. Have you got <b>it</b>, Frodo?”
<br>   “No. It <b>was</b> not at Bag End. He must have taken <b>it</b> away.”
<br>   “Well, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> saying,” Merry proceeded, “<b>I</b> kept my knowledge <b>to</b> myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; <b>and</b> as we were serious, too, <b>and</b> meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a <b>very</b> easy nut <b>to</b> crack, <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>is</b> worse. But if you want <b>to</b> be introduced <b>to</b> our chief investigator, <b>I</b> can produce him.”
<br>   “Where <b>is</b> he?” said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked <b>and</b> sinister figure <b>to</b> come out <b>of</b> a cupboard.
<br>   “Step forward, Sam!” said Merry; <b>and</b> Sam stood up with a face scarlet up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ears. “Here’s our collector <b>of</b> information! And he collected a lot, <b>I</b> can tell you, before he <b>was</b> finally caught. After which, <b>I</b> may say, he seemed <b>to</b> regard himself as <b>on</b> parole, <b>and</b> dried up.”
<br>   “Sam!” cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go <b>no</b> further, <b>and</b> quite unable <b>to</b> decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, <b>or</b> merely foolish.
<br>   “Yes, sir!” said Sam. “Begging your pardon, sir! But <b>I</b> meant <b>no</b> wrong <b>to</b> you, Mr. Frodo, nor <b>to</b> Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, mind you; <b>and</b> when you said go alone, he said <b>no</b>! take someone as you can trust.”
<br>   “But <b>it</b> does not seem that <b>I</b> can trust anyone,” said Frodo. Sam looked at him unhappily. “It all depends <b>on</b> <b>what</b> you want,” put <b>in</b> Merry. “You can trust us <b>to</b> stick <b>to</b> you through thick <b>and</b> thin—<b>to</b> <b>the</b> bitter end. And you can trust us <b>to</b> keep any secret <b>of</b> yours—closer than you keep <b>it</b> yourself. But you cannot trust us <b>to</b> let you face trouble alone, <b>and</b> go off <b>without</b> a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there <b>it</b> <b>is</b>. We know most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about <b>the</b> Ring. We are horribly afraid—<b>but</b> we are coming with you; <b>or</b> following you like hounds.”
<br>   “And after all, sir,” added Sam, “you did ought <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Elves” advice. Gildor said you should take them as <b>was</b> willing, <b>and</b> you can’t deny <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t deny <b>it</b>,” said Frodo, looking at Sam, who <b>was</b> now grinning. “<b>I</b> don’t deny <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b>’ll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore <b>or</b> not. <b>I</b> shall kick you hard <b>to</b> make sure.
<br>   “You are a set <b>of</b> deceitful scoundrels!” he said, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “But bless you!” he laughed, getting up <b>and</b> waving his arms, “<b>I</b> give <b>in</b>. <b>I</b> will take Gildor’s advice. If <b>the</b> danger were not so dark, <b>I</b> should dance for joy. Even so, <b>I</b> cannot help feeling happy; happier than <b>I</b> have felt for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dreaded this evening.”
<br>   “Good! That’s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo <b>and</b> company!” they shouted; <b>and</b> they danced round him. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin began a song, which they <b>had</b> apparently got ready for <b>the</b> occasion.
<br>   It <b>was</b> made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dwarf-song that started Bilbo <b>on</b> his adventure long ago, <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same tune:
<br>   
<br>Farewell we call <b>to</b> hearth <b>and</b> hall!
<br>Though wind may blow <b>and</b> rain may fall,
<br>We must away ere break <b>of</b> day
<br>Far over wood <b>and</b> mountain tall.
<br>
<br>To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell
<br>In glades beneath <b>the</b> misty fell,
<br>Through moor <b>and</b> waste we ride <b>in</b> haste,
<br>And whither then we cannot tell.
<br>
<br>With foes ahead, behind us dread,
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> sky shall be our bed,
<br>Until at last our toil be passed,
<br>Our journey done, our errand sped.
<br>
<br>We must away! We must away!
<br>We ride before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day!
<br>   
<br>   “Very good!” said Frodo. “But <b>in</b> that case there are a lot <b>of</b> things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before we go <b>to</b> bed—under a roof, for tonight at any rate.”
<br>   “Oh! That <b>was</b> poetry!” said Pippin. “Do you really mean <b>to</b> start before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t know,” answered Frodo. “<b>I</b> fear those Black Riders, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sure <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unsafe <b>to</b> stay <b>in</b> one place long, especially <b>in</b> a place <b>to</b> which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> known <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going. Also Gildor advised me not <b>to</b> wait. But <b>I</b> should <b>very</b> much like <b>to</b> see Gandalf. <b>I</b> could see that even Gildor <b>was</b> disturbed when he heard that Gandalf <b>had</b> never appeared. It really depends <b>on</b> two things. How soon could <b>the</b> Riders <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Bucklebury? And how soon could we <b>get</b> off? It will take a good deal <b>of</b> preparation.”
<br>   “The answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second question,” said Merry, “<b>is</b> that we could <b>get</b> off <b>in</b> an hour. <b>I</b> have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies <b>in</b> a stable across <b>the</b> fields; stores <b>and</b> tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perishable food.”
<br>   “It seems <b>to</b> have been a <b>very</b> efficient conspiracy,” said Frodo. “But <b>what</b> about <b>the</b> Black Riders? Would <b>it</b> be safe <b>to</b> wait one day for Gandalf?”
<br>   “That all depends <b>on</b> <b>what</b> you think <b>the</b> Riders would <b>do</b>, if they found you here,” answered Merry. “They could have reached here <b>by</b> now, <b>of</b> course, if they were not stopped at <b>the</b> North-gate, where <b>the</b> Hedge runs down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river-<b>bank</b>, just this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through <b>by</b> night, though they might break through. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daylight they would try <b>to</b> keep them out, <b>I</b> think, at any rate until they got a message through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall—for they would not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>and</b> would certainly be frightened <b>by</b> them. But, <b>of</b> course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning even a Black Rider that rode up <b>and</b> asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It <b>is</b> pretty generally known that you are coming back <b>to</b> live at Crickhollow.”
<br>   Frodo sat for a while <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>. “<b>I</b> have made up my mind,” he said finally. “<b>I</b> am starting tomorrow, as soon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> light. But <b>I</b> am not going <b>by</b> road: <b>it</b> would be safer <b>to</b> wait here than that. If <b>I</b> go through <b>the</b> North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at <b>once</b>, instead <b>of</b> being secret for several days at least, as <b>it</b> might be. And <b>what</b> <b>is</b> more, <b>the</b> Bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> East Road near <b>the</b> borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets <b>into</b> Buckland <b>or</b> not. We don’t know how many there are; <b>but</b> there are at least two, <b>and</b> possibly more. The only thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> go off <b>in</b> a quite unexpected direction.”
<br>   “But that can only mean going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest!” said Fredegar horrified. “You can’t be thinking <b>of</b> doing that. It <b>is</b> quite as dangerous as Black Riders.”
<br>   “Not quite,” said Merry. It sounds <b>very</b> desperate, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> believe Frodo <b>is</b> right. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only way <b>of</b> getting off <b>without</b> being followed at <b>once</b>. With luck we might gel a considerable start.”
<br>   “But you won’t have any luck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest,” objected Fredegar. “No one ever has luck <b>in</b> there. You’ll gel lost. People don’t go <b>in</b> there.”
<br>   “Oh yes they <b>do</b>!” said Merry. “The Brandybucks go <b>in</b>—occasionally when <b>the</b> fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went <b>in</b> <b>once</b>, long ago. <b>I</b> have been <b>in</b> several times: usually <b>in</b> daylight, <b>of</b> course, when <b>the</b> trees are sleepy <b>and</b> fairly quiet.”
<br>   “Well, <b>do</b> as you think best!” said Fredegar. “<b>I</b> am more afraid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest than <b>of</b> anything <b>I</b> know about: <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b> are a nightmare; <b>but</b> my vote hardly counts, as <b>I</b> am not going <b>on</b> <b>the</b> journey. Still, <b>I</b> am <b>very</b> glad someone <b>is</b> stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf <b>what</b> you have done, when he turns up, as <b>I</b> am sure he will before long.”
<br>   Fond as he <b>was</b> <b>of</b> Frodo, Fatty Bolger <b>had</b> <b>no</b> desire <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Shire, nor <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> lay outside <b>it</b>. His family came from <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, from Budgeford <b>in</b> Bridgefields <b>in</b> fact, <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> never been over <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge. His task, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original plans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspirators, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stay behind <b>and</b> deal with inquisitive folk, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> keep up as long as possible <b>the</b> pretence that Mr. Baggins <b>was</b> still living at Crickhollow. He <b>had</b> even brought along some old clothes <b>of</b> Frodo’s <b>to</b> help him <b>in</b> playing <b>the</b> part. They little <b>thought</b> how dangerous that part might prove.
<br>   “Excellent!” said Frodo, when he understood <b>the</b> plan. “We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. <b>I</b> don’t know whether these Riders can read <b>or</b> not, <b>of</b> course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should not have dared <b>to</b> risk a written message, <b>in</b> case they got <b>in</b> <b>and</b> searched <b>the</b> house. But if Fatty <b>is</b> willing <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> fort, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can be sure <b>of</b> Gandalf knowing <b>the</b> way we have gone, that decides me. <b>I</b> am going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest first thing tomorrow.”
<br>   “Well, that’s that,” said Pippin. “On <b>the</b> whole <b>I</b> would rather have our job than Fatty’s—waiting here till Black Riders come.”
<br>   “You wait till you are well inside <b>the</b> Forest,” said Fredegar. “You’ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.”
<br>   “It’s <b>no</b> good arguing about <b>it</b> any more,” said Merry. “We have still got <b>to</b> tidy up <b>and</b> put <b>the</b> finishing touches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> packing, before we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> bed. <b>I</b> shall call you all before <b>the</b> break <b>of</b> day.”
<br>   When at last he <b>had</b> got <b>to</b> bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He. <b>was</b> glad that he <b>was</b> riding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Eventually he fell <b>into</b> a vague dream, <b>in</b> which he seemed <b>to</b> be looking out <b>of</b> a high window over a dark sea <b>of</b> tangled trees. Down below among <b>the</b> roots there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> creatures crawling <b>and</b> snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner <b>or</b> later.
<br>   Then he heard a noise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance. At first he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a great wind coming over <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest. Then he knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not leaves, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea far-off; a sound he <b>had</b> never heard <b>in</b> waking life, though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he <b>was</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open. There were <b>no</b> trees after all. He <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a dark heath, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a strange salt smell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone <b>on</b> a high ridge. A great desire came over him <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> tower <b>and</b> see <b>the</b> Sea. He started <b>to</b> struggle up <b>the</b> ridge towards <b>the</b> tower: <b>but</b> suddenly a light came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a noise <b>of</b> thunder.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 6
<br><b>THE</b> OLD FOREST
<br>
<br>   Frodo woke suddenly. It <b>was</b> still dark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. Merry <b>was</b> standing there with a candle <b>in</b> one hand, <b>and</b> banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door with <b>the</b> other. “All right! What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?” said Frodo, still shaken <b>and</b> bewildered.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>!” cried Merry. “It <b>is</b> time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up. It <b>is</b> half past four <b>and</b> <b>very</b> foggy. Come <b>on</b>! Sam <b>is</b> already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin <b>is</b> up. <b>I</b> am just going <b>to</b> saddle <b>the</b> ponies, <b>and</b> fetch <b>the</b> one that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must <b>get</b> up <b>and</b> see us off.”
<br>   Soon after six o’clock <b>the</b> five hobbits were ready <b>to</b> start. Fatty Bolger <b>was</b> still yawning. They stole quietly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. Merry went <b>in</b> front leading a laden pony, <b>and</b> took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> then cut across several fields. The leaves <b>of</b> trees were glistening, <b>and</b> every twig <b>was</b> dripping; <b>the</b> grass <b>was</b> grey with cold dew. Everything <b>was</b> still, <b>and</b> far-away noises seemed near <b>and</b> clear: fowls chattering <b>in</b> a yard, someone closing a door <b>of</b> a distant house.
<br>   In their shed they found <b>the</b> ponies; sturdy little beasts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind loved <b>by</b> hobbits, not speedy, <b>but</b> good for a long day’s work. They mounted, <b>and</b> soon they were riding off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist, which seemed <b>to</b> open reluctantly before them <b>and</b> close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about an hour, slowly <b>and</b> <b>without</b> talking, they saw <b>the</b> Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> netted over with silver cobwebs. “How are you going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through this?” asked Fredegar. “Follow me!” said Merry, “<b>and</b> you will see.” He turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left along <b>the</b> Hedge, <b>and</b> soon they came <b>to</b> a point where <b>it</b> bent inwards, running along <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> a hollow. A cutting <b>had</b> been made, at some distance from <b>the</b> Hedge, <b>and</b> went sloping gently down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. It <b>had</b> walls <b>of</b> brick at <b>the</b> sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over <b>and</b> formed a tunnel that dived deep under <b>the</b> Hedge <b>and</b> came out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side.
<br>   Here Fatty Bolger halted. “Good-bye, Frodo!” he said. “<b>I</b> wish you were not going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Forest. <b>I</b> only hope you will not need rescuing before <b>the</b> day <b>is</b> out. But good luck <b>to</b> you—today <b>and</b> every day!”
<br>   “If there are <b>no</b> worse things ahead than <b>the</b> Old Forest, <b>I</b> shall be lucky,” said Frodo. “Tell Gandalf <b>to</b> hurry along <b>the</b> East Road: we shall soon be back <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> going as fast as we can.” “Good-bye!” they cried, <b>and</b> rode down <b>the</b> slope <b>and</b> disappeared from Fredegar’s sight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tunnel.
<br>   It <b>was</b> dark <b>and</b> damp. At <b>the</b> far end <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closed <b>by</b> a gate <b>of</b> thick-set iron bars. Merry got down <b>and</b> unlocked <b>the</b> gate, <b>and</b> when they <b>had</b> all passed through he pushed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> again. It shut with a clang, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lock clicked. The sound <b>was</b> ominous.
<br>   “There!” said Merry. “You have left <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> are now outside, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest.”
<br>   “Are <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b> true?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don’t know <b>what</b> stories you mean,” Merry answered. “If you mean <b>the</b> old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used <b>to</b> tell him, about goblins <b>and</b> wolves <b>and</b> things <b>of</b> that sort, <b>I</b> should say <b>no</b>. At any rate <b>I</b> don’t believe them. But <b>the</b> Forest <b>is</b> queer. Everything <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much more alive, more aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> going <b>on</b>, so <b>to</b> speak, than things are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. And <b>the</b> trees <b>do</b> not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely <b>to</b> watch you, as long as daylight lasts, <b>and</b> don’t <b>do</b> much. Occasionally <b>the</b> most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, <b>or</b> stick a root out, <b>or</b> grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, <b>or</b> so <b>I</b> am told. <b>I</b> have only <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> been <b>in</b> here after dark, <b>and</b> then only near <b>the</b> hedge. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> all <b>the</b> trees were whispering <b>to</b> each other, passing news <b>and</b> plots along <b>in</b> an unintelligible language; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branches swayed <b>and</b> groped <b>without</b> any wind. They <b>do</b> say <b>the</b> trees <b>do</b> actually move, <b>and</b> can surround strangers <b>and</b> hem them <b>in</b>. In fact long ago they attacked <b>the</b> Hedge: they came <b>and</b> planted themselves right <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> leaned over <b>it</b>. But <b>the</b> hobbits came <b>and</b> cut down hundreds <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> made a great bonfire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> burned all <b>the</b> ground <b>in</b> a long strip east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge. After that <b>the</b> trees gave up <b>the</b> attack, <b>but</b> they became <b>very</b> unfriendly. There <b>is</b> still a wide bare space not far inside where <b>the</b> bonfire <b>was</b> made.”
<br>   “Is <b>it</b> only <b>the</b> trees that are dangerous?” asked Pippin.
<br>   “There are various queer things living deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side,” said Merry, “<b>or</b> at least <b>I</b> have heard so; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have never seen any <b>of</b> them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; <b>but</b> they seem <b>to</b> shift <b>and</b> change from time <b>to</b> time <b>in</b> a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there <b>is</b>, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> for a long time, <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> quite a broad path leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bonfire Glade, <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> more <b>or</b> less <b>in</b> our direction, east <b>and</b> a little north. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> path <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> find.”
<br>   The hobbits now left <b>the</b> tunnel-gate <b>and</b> rode across <b>the</b> wide hollow. On <b>the</b> far side <b>was</b> a faint path leading up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, a hundred yards <b>and</b> more beyond <b>the</b> Hedge; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> vanished as soon as <b>it</b> brought them under <b>the</b> trees. Looking back they could see <b>the</b> dark line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge through <b>the</b> stems <b>of</b> trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks <b>of</b> innumerable sizes <b>and</b> shapes: straight <b>or</b> bent, twisted, leaning, squat <b>or</b> slender, smooth <b>or</b> gnarled <b>and</b> branched; <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> stems were green <b>or</b> grey with moss <b>and</b> slimy, shaggy growths.
<br>   Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. “You <b>had</b> better lead <b>on</b> <b>and</b> find that path,” Frodo said <b>to</b> him. “Don’t let us lose one another, <b>or</b> forget which way <b>the</b> Hedge lies!”
<br>   They picked a way among <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding <b>the</b> many writhing <b>and</b> interlacing roots. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> undergrowth. The ground <b>was</b> rising steadily, <b>and</b> as they went forward <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> trees became taller, darker, <b>and</b> thicker. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound, except an occasional drip <b>of</b> moisture falling through <b>the</b> still leaves. For <b>the</b> moment there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> whispering <b>or</b> movement among <b>the</b> branches; <b>but</b> they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening <b>to</b> dislike <b>and</b> even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, <b>or</b> glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.
<br>   There <b>was</b> not as yet any sign <b>of</b> a path, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees seemed constantly <b>to</b> bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear <b>it</b> any longer, <b>and</b> <b>without</b> warning let out a shout. “Oi! Oi!” he cried. “<b>I</b> am not going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. Just let me pass through, will you!”
<br>   The others halted startled; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> cry fell as if muffled <b>by</b> a heavy curtain. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> echo <b>or</b> answer though <b>the</b> wood seemed <b>to</b> become more crowded <b>and</b> more watchful than before.
<br>   “<b>I</b> should not shout, if <b>I</b> were you,” said Merry. It does more harm than good.”
<br>   Frodo began <b>to</b> wonder if <b>it</b> were possible <b>to</b> find a way through, <b>and</b> if he <b>had</b> been right <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> others come <b>into</b> this abominable wood. Merry <b>was</b> looking from side <b>to</b> side, <b>and</b> seemed already uncertain which way <b>to</b> go. Pippin noticed <b>it</b>. “It has not taken you long <b>to</b> lose us,” he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle <b>of</b> relief <b>and</b> pointed ahead.
<br>   “Well, well!” he said. “These trees <b>do</b> shift. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Bonfire Glade <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> us (<b>or</b> <b>I</b> hope so), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> have moved away!”
<br>   The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> found themselves <b>in</b> a wide circular space. There <b>was</b> sky above them, blue <b>and</b> clear <b>to</b> their surprise, for down under <b>the</b> Forest-roof they <b>had</b> not been able <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> rising morning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist. The sun <b>was</b> not, however, high enough yet <b>to</b> shine down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clearing, though its light <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker <b>and</b> greener about <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade, enclosing <b>it</b> with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass <b>and</b> many tall plants: stalky <b>and</b> faded hemlocks <b>and</b> wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding <b>into</b> fluffy ashes, <b>and</b> rampant nettles <b>and</b> thistles. A dreary place: <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed a charming <b>and</b> cheerful garden after <b>the</b> close Forest.
<br>   The hobbits felt encouraged, <b>and</b> looked up hopefully at <b>the</b> broadening daylight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. At <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade there <b>was</b> a break <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> a clear path beyond <b>it</b>. They could see <b>it</b> running <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood, wide <b>in</b> places <b>and</b> open above, though every now <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> trees drew <b>in</b> <b>and</b> overshadowed <b>it</b> with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently, <b>but</b> they now went much quicker, <b>and</b> with better heart; for <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them that <b>the</b> Forest <b>had</b> relented, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> let them pass unhindered after all.
<br>   But after a while <b>the</b> air began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hot <b>and</b> stuffy. The trees drew close again <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> they could <b>no</b> longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again <b>the</b> ill will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood pressing <b>on</b> them. So silent <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> their ponies” hoofs, rustling <b>on</b> dead leaves <b>and</b> occasionally stumbling <b>on</b> hidden roots, seemed <b>to</b> thud <b>in</b> their ears. Frodo tried <b>to</b> sing a song <b>to</b> encourage them, <b>but</b> his voice sank <b>to</b> a murmur.
<br>   
<br>O! Wanderers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadowed land
<br>despair not! For though dark they stand,
<br>all woods there be must end at last,
<br><b>and</b> see <b>the</b> open sun go past:
<br><b>the</b> setting sun, <b>the</b> rising sun,
<br><b>the</b> day’s end, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> day begun.
<br>For east <b>or</b> west all woods must fail…
<br>   
<br>   Fail—even as he said <b>the</b> word his voice faded <b>into</b> silence. The air seemed heavy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> making <b>of</b> words wearisome. Just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash <b>into</b> <b>the</b> path. The trees seemed <b>to</b> close <b>in</b> before them.
<br>   “They <b>do</b> not like all that about ending <b>and</b> failing,” said Merry. “<b>I</b> should not sing any more at present. Wait till we <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> then we’ll turn <b>and</b> give them a rousing chorus!”
<br>   He spoke cheerfully, <b>and</b> if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show <b>it</b>. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight <b>was</b> settling steadily <b>on</b> Frodo’s heart, <b>and</b> he regretted now with every step forward that he <b>had</b> ever <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> challenging <b>the</b> menace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. He <b>was</b>, indeed, just about <b>to</b> stop <b>and</b> propose going back (if that <b>was</b> still possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, <b>and</b> became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, <b>and</b> ahead they could see <b>the</b> path going almost straight forward. Before them, <b>but</b> some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling wood. The path seemed <b>to</b> be making directly for <b>it</b>.
<br>   They now hurried forward again, delighted with <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> climbing out for a while above <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest. The path dipped, <b>and</b> then again began <b>to</b> climb upwards, leading them at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steep hillside. There <b>it</b> left <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turf. The wood stood all round <b>the</b> hill like thick hair that ended sharply <b>in</b> a circle round a shaven crown.
<br>   The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round <b>and</b> round until they reached <b>the</b> top. There they stood <b>and</b> gazed about them. The air <b>was</b> gleaming <b>and</b> sunlit, <b>but</b> hazy; <b>and</b> they could not see <b>to</b> any great distance. Near at hand <b>the</b> mist <b>was</b> now almost gone; though here <b>and</b> there <b>it</b> lay <b>in</b> hollows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> them, out <b>of</b> a deep fold cutting right across <b>the</b> Forest, <b>the</b> fog still rose like steam <b>or</b> wisps <b>of</b> white smoke.
<br>   “That,” said Merry, pointing with his hand, “that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle. It comes down out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs <b>and</b> flows south-west through <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> Brandywine below Haysend. We don’t want <b>to</b> go that way! The Withywindle valley <b>is</b> said <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> queerest part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole wood—<b>the</b> centre from which all <b>the</b> queerness comes, as <b>it</b> were.”
<br>   The others looked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction that Merry pointed out, <b>but</b> they could see little <b>but</b> mists over <b>the</b> damp <b>and</b> deep-cut valley; <b>and</b> beyond <b>it</b> <b>the</b> southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest faded from view.
<br>   The sun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top <b>was</b> now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o’clock; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much <b>in</b> other directions. In <b>the</b> west they could not make out either <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hedge <b>or</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine beyond <b>it</b>. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see <b>nothing</b> that might be <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great East Road, for which they were making. They were <b>on</b> an island <b>in</b> a sea <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horizon <b>was</b> veiled.
<br>   On <b>the</b> south-eastern side <b>the</b> ground fell <b>very</b> steeply, as if <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill were continued far down under <b>the</b> trees, like island-shores that really are <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> a mountain rising out <b>of</b> deep waters. They sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green edge <b>and</b> looked out over <b>the</b> woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal. As <b>the</b> sun rose <b>and</b> passed noon they glimpsed far off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> grey-green lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs that lay beyond <b>the</b> Old Forest <b>on</b> that side. That cheered them greatly; for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good <b>to</b> see a sight <b>of</b> anything beyond <b>the</b> wood’s borders, though they did not mean <b>to</b> go that way, if they could help <b>it</b>: <b>the</b> Barrow-downs <b>had</b> as sinister a reputation <b>in</b> hobbit-legend as <b>the</b> Forest itself.
<br>   At length they made up their minds <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again. The path that <b>had</b> brought them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill reappeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northward side; <b>but</b> they <b>had</b> not followed <b>it</b> far before they became aware that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bending steadily <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Soon <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> descend rapidly <b>and</b> they guessed that <b>it</b> must actually be heading towards <b>the</b> Withywindle valley: not at all <b>the</b> direction they wished lo take. After some discussion they decided <b>to</b> leave this misleading path <b>and</b> strike northward; for although they <b>had</b> not been able <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> from <b>the</b> hill-top, <b>the</b> Road must lie that way, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> could not be many miles off. Also northward, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>the</b> land seemed lo be drier <b>and</b> more open, climbing up <b>to</b> slopes where <b>the</b> trees were thinner, <b>and</b> pines <b>and</b> firs replaced <b>the</b> oaks <b>and</b> ashes <b>and</b> other strange <b>and</b> nameless trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> denser wood.
<br>   At first their choice seemed <b>to</b> be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>in</b> an open glade they seemed unaccountably <b>to</b> have veered eastwards. But after a time <b>the</b> trees began <b>to</b> close <b>in</b> again, just where they <b>had</b> appeared from a distance <b>to</b> be thinner <b>and</b> less tangled. Then deep folds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground were discovered unexpectedly, like <b>the</b> ruts <b>of</b> great giant-wheels <b>or</b> wide moats <b>and</b> sunken roads long disused <b>and</b> choked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line <b>of</b> march, <b>and</b> could only be crossed <b>by</b> scrambling down <b>and</b> out again, which <b>was</b> troublesome <b>and</b> difficult with their ponies. Each time they climbed down they found <b>the</b> hollow filled with thick bushes <b>and</b> matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, <b>but</b> only gave way when they turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right; <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go some distance along <b>the</b> bottom before they could find a way up <b>the</b> further <b>bank</b>. Each time they clambered out, <b>the</b> trees seemed deeper <b>and</b> darker; <b>and</b> always <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> upwards <b>it</b> <b>was</b> most difficult <b>to</b> find a way, <b>and</b> they were forced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>and</b> downwards.
<br>   After an hour <b>or</b> two they <b>had</b> lost all clear sense <b>of</b> direction, though they knew well enough that they <b>had</b> long ceased <b>to</b> go northward at all. They were being headed off, <b>and</b> were simply following a course chosen for them—eastwards <b>and</b> southwards, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>and</b> not out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   The afternoon <b>was</b> wearing away when they scrambled <b>and</b> stumbled <b>into</b> a fold that <b>was</b> wider <b>and</b> deeper than any they <b>had</b> yet met. It <b>was</b> so sleep <b>and</b> overhung that <b>it</b> proved impossible <b>to</b> climb out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again, either forwards <b>or</b> backwards, <b>without</b> leaving their ponies <b>and</b> their baggage behind. All they could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> fold—downwards. The ground grew soft, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> places boggy; springs appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banks, <b>and</b> soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled <b>and</b> babbled through a weedy bed. Then <b>the</b> ground began <b>to</b> fall rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> brook growing strong <b>and</b> noisy, flowed <b>and</b> leaped swiftly downhill. They were <b>in</b> a deep dim-lit gully over-arched <b>by</b> trees high above them.
<br>   After stumbling along for some way along <b>the</b> stream, they came quite suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gloom. As if through a gate they saw <b>the</b> sunlight before them. Coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening they found that they <b>had</b> made their way down through a cleft <b>in</b> a high sleep <b>bank</b>, almost a cliff. At its feet <b>was</b> a wide space <b>of</b> grass <b>and</b> reeds; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance could be glimpsed another <b>bank</b> almost as steep. A golden afternoon <b>of</b> late sunshine lay warm <b>and</b> drowsy upon <b>the</b> hidden land between. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there wound lazily a dark river <b>of</b> brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, <b>and</b> flecked with thousands <b>of</b> faded willow-leaves. The air <b>was</b> thick with them, fluttering yellow from <b>the</b> branches; for there <b>was</b> a warm <b>and</b> gentle breeze blowing softly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reeds were rustling, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> willow-boughs were creaking.
<br>   “Well, now <b>I</b> have at least some notion <b>of</b> where we are!” said Merry. “We have come almost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction <b>to</b> which we intended. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> River Withywindle! <b>I</b> will go <b>on</b> <b>and</b> explore.”
<br>   He passed out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sunshine <b>and</b> disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> long grasses. After a while he reappeared, <b>and</b> reported that there <b>was</b> fairly solid ground between <b>the</b> cliff-foot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> river; <b>in</b> some places firm turf went down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water’s edge. “What’s more,” he said, “there seems <b>to</b> be something like a footpath winding along <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. If we turn left <b>and</b> follow <b>it</b>, we shall be bound <b>to</b> come out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest eventually.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> dare say!” said Pippin. “That <b>is</b>, if <b>the</b> track goes <b>on</b> so far, <b>and</b> does not simply lead us <b>into</b> a bog <b>and</b> leave us there. Who made <b>the</b> track, <b>do</b> you suppose, <b>and</b> why? <b>I</b> am sure <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not for our benefit. <b>I</b> am getting <b>very</b> suspicious <b>of</b> this Forest <b>and</b> everything <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> begin <b>to</b> believe all <b>the</b> stories about <b>it</b>. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have <b>to</b> go?”
<br>   “No,” said Merry, “<b>I</b> haven’t. <b>I</b> don’t know <b>in</b> <b>the</b> least how far down <b>the</b> Withywindle we are, <b>or</b> who could possibly come here often enough <b>to</b> make a path along <b>it</b>. But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other way out that <b>I</b> can see <b>or</b> think <b>of</b>.”
<br>   There being <b>nothing</b> else for <b>it</b>, they filed out, <b>and</b> Merry led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> path that he <b>had</b> discovered. Everywhere <b>the</b> reeds <b>and</b> grasses were lush <b>and</b> tall, <b>in</b> places far above their heads; <b>but</b> <b>once</b> found, <b>the</b> path <b>was</b> easy <b>to</b> follow, as <b>it</b> turned <b>and</b> twisted, picking out <b>the</b> sounder ground among <b>the</b> bogs <b>and</b> pools. Here <b>and</b> there <b>it</b> passed over other rills, running down gullies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> higher forest-lands, <b>and</b> at these points there were tree-trunks <b>or</b> bundles <b>of</b> brushwood laid carefully across.
<br>   The hobbits began <b>to</b> feel <b>very</b> hot. There were armies <b>of</b> flies <b>of</b> all kinds buzzing round their ears, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> afternoon sun <b>was</b> burning <b>on</b> their backs. At last they came suddenly <b>into</b> a thin shade; great grey branches reached across <b>the</b> path. Each step forward became more reluctant than <b>the</b> last. Sleepiness seemed <b>to</b> be creeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> up their legs, <b>and</b> falling softly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air upon their heads <b>and</b> eyes.
<br>   Frodo felt his chin go down <b>and</b> his head nod. Just <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> him Pippin fell forward <b>on</b> <b>to</b> his knees. Frodo halted. “It’s <b>no</b> good,” he heard Merry saying. “Can’t go another step <b>without</b> rest. Must have nap. It’s cool under <b>the</b> willows. Less flies!”
<br>   Frodo did not like <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> this. “Come <b>on</b>!” he cried. “We can’t have a nap yet. We must <b>get</b> clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest first.” But <b>the</b> others were too far gone <b>to</b> care. Beside them Sam stood yawning <b>and</b> blinking stupidly.
<br>   Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There now seemed hardly a sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. The flies <b>had</b> stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> hearing, a soft fluttering as <b>of</b> a song half whispered, seemed <b>to</b> stir <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes <b>and</b> saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old <b>and</b> hoary. Enormous <b>it</b> looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted <b>and</b> twisted trunk gaping <b>in</b> wide fissures that creaked faintly as <b>the</b> boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against <b>the</b> bright sky dazzled him, <b>and</b> he toppled over, lying where he fell upon <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Merry <b>and</b> Pippin dragged themselves forward <b>and</b> lay down with their backs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> willow-trunk. Behind them <b>the</b> great cracks gaped wide <b>to</b> receive them as <b>the</b> tree swayed <b>and</b> creaked. They looked up at <b>the</b> grey <b>and</b> yellow leaves, moving softly against <b>the</b> light, <b>and</b> singing. They shut their eyes, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something about water <b>and</b> sleep. They gave themselves up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spell <b>and</b> fell fast asleep at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great grey willow.
<br>   Frodo lay for a while fighting with <b>the</b> sleep that <b>was</b> overpowering him; then with an effort he struggled <b>to</b> his feel again. He felt a compelling desire for cool water. “Wait for me, Sam,” he stammered. “Must bathe feet a minute.”
<br>   Half <b>in</b> a dream he wandered forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riverward side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, where great winding roots grew out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream, like gnarled dragonets straining down <b>to</b> drink. He straddled one <b>of</b> these, <b>and</b> paddled his hot feel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cool brown water; <b>and</b> there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   Sam sat down <b>and</b> scratched his head, <b>and</b> yawned like a cavern. He <b>was</b> worried. The afternoon <b>was</b> getting late, <b>and</b> he <b>thought</b> this sudden sleepiness uncanny. “There’s more behind this than sun <b>and</b> warm air,” he muttered <b>to</b> himself. “<b>I</b> don’t like this great big tree. <b>I</b> don’t trust <b>it</b>. Hark at <b>it</b> singing about sleep now! This won’t <b>do</b> at all!”
<br>   He pulled himself <b>to</b> his feet, <b>and</b> staggered off <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ponies. He found that two <b>had</b> wandered <b>on</b> a good way along <b>the</b> path; <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> just caught them <b>and</b> brought them back towards <b>the</b> others, when he heard two noises; one loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other soft <b>but</b> <b>very</b> clear. One <b>was</b> <b>the</b> splash <b>of</b> something heavy falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water; <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> a noise like <b>the</b> snick <b>of</b> a lock when a door quietly closes fast.
<br>   He rushed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. Frodo <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> a great tree-root seemed <b>to</b> be over him <b>and</b> holding him down, <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> not struggling. Sam gripped him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> jacket, <b>and</b> dragged him from under <b>the</b> root; <b>and</b> then with difficulty hauled him <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. Almost at <b>once</b> he woke, <b>and</b> coughed <b>and</b> spluttered.
<br>   “Do you know, Sam,” he said at length, “<b>the</b> beastly tree threw me <b>in</b>! <b>I</b> felt <b>it</b>. The big root just twisted round <b>and</b> tipped me <b>in</b>!”
<br>   “You were dreaming <b>I</b> expect, Mr. Frodo,” said Sam. “You shouldn’t sit <b>in</b> such a place, if you feel sleepy.”
<br>   “What about <b>the</b> others?” Frodo asked. “<b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> sort <b>of</b> dreams they are <b>having</b>.”
<br>   They went round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, <b>and</b> then Sam understood <b>the</b> click that he <b>had</b> heard. Pippin <b>had</b> vanished. The crack <b>by</b> which he <b>had</b> laid himself <b>had</b> closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry <b>was</b> trapped: another crack <b>had</b> closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> him <b>was</b> inside a dark opening, <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> which gripped like a pair <b>of</b> pincers.
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam beat first upon <b>the</b> tree-trunk where Pippin <b>had</b> lain. They then struggled frantically <b>to</b> pull open <b>the</b> jaws <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crack that held poor Merry. It <b>was</b> quite useless.
<br>   “What a foul thing <b>to</b> happen!” cried Frodo wildly. “Why did we ever come <b>into</b> this dreadful Forest? <b>I</b> wish we were all back at Crickhollow!” He kicked <b>the</b> tree with all his strength, heedless <b>of</b> his own feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through <b>the</b> stem <b>and</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> branches; <b>the</b> leaves rustled <b>and</b> whispered, <b>but</b> with a sound now <b>of</b> faint <b>and</b> far-off laughter.
<br>   “<b>I</b> suppose we haven’t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?” asked Sam.
<br>   “<b>I</b> brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,” said Frodo. “That wouldn’t be much <b>use</b>.”
<br>   “Wait a minute!” cried Sam, struck <b>by</b> an idea suggested <b>by</b> firewood. “We might <b>do</b> something with fire!”
<br>   “We might,” said Frodo doubtfully. “We might succeed <b>in</b> roasting Pippin alive inside.”
<br>   “We might try <b>to</b> hurt <b>or</b> frighten this tree <b>to</b> begin with,” said Sam fiercely. “If <b>it</b> don’t let them go, <b>I</b>’ll have <b>it</b> down, if <b>I</b> have <b>to</b> gnaw <b>it</b>.” He ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ponies <b>and</b> before long came back with two tinder-boxes <b>and</b> a hatchet.
<br>   Quickly they gathered dry grass <b>and</b> leaves, <b>and</b> bits <b>of</b> bark; <b>and</b> made a pile <b>of</b> broken twigs <b>and</b> chopped sticks. These they heaped against <b>the</b> trunk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree from <b>the</b> prisoners. As soon as Sam <b>had</b> struck a spark <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tinder, <b>it</b> kindled <b>the</b> dry grass <b>and</b> a flurry <b>of</b> flame <b>and</b> smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers <b>of</b> fire licked against <b>the</b> dry scored rind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient tree <b>and</b> scorched <b>it</b>. A tremor ran through <b>the</b> whole willow. The leaves seemed <b>to</b> hiss above their heads with a sound <b>of</b> pain <b>and</b> anger. A loud scream came from Merry, <b>and</b> from far inside <b>the</b> tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.
<br>   “Put <b>it</b> out! Put <b>it</b> out!” cried Merry. “He’ll squeeze me <b>in</b> two, if you don’t. He says so!”
<br>   “Who? What?” shouted Frodo, rushing round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   “Put <b>it</b> out! Put <b>it</b> out!” begged Merry. The branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willow began <b>to</b> sway violently. There <b>was</b> a sound as <b>of</b> a wind rising <b>and</b> spreading outwards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> other trees round about, as though they <b>had</b> dropped a stone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> quiet slumber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river-valley <b>and</b> set up ripples <b>of</b> anger that ran out over <b>the</b> whole Forest. Sam kicked at <b>the</b> little fire <b>and</b> stamped out <b>the</b> sparks. But Frodo, <b>without</b> any clear idea <b>of</b> why he did so, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he hoped for, ran along <b>the</b> path crying help! help! help! It seemed <b>to</b> him that he could hardly hear <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> his own shrill voice: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> blown away from him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> willow-wind <b>and</b> drowned <b>in</b> a clamour <b>of</b> leaves, as soon as <b>the</b> words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost <b>and</b> witless.
<br>   Suddenly he slopped. There <b>was</b> an answer, <b>or</b> so he <b>thought</b>; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> come from behind him, away down <b>the</b> path further back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest. He turned round <b>and</b> listened, <b>and</b> soon there could be <b>no</b> doubt: someone <b>was</b> singing a song; a deep glad voice <b>was</b> singing carelessly <b>and</b> happily, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> singing nonsense:
<br>   
<br>Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!
<br>Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal <b>the</b> willow!
<br>Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>   
<br>   Half hopeful <b>and</b> half afraid <b>of</b> some new danger, Frodo <b>and</b> Sam now both stood still. Suddenly out <b>of</b> a long string <b>of</b> nonsense-words (<b>or</b> so they seemed) <b>the</b> voice rose up loud <b>and</b> clear <b>and</b> burst <b>into</b> this song:
<br>   
<br>Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling!
<br>Light goes <b>the</b> weather-wind <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feathered starling.
<br>Down along under Hill, shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight,
<br>Waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep for <b>the</b> cold starlight,
<br>There my pretty lady <b>is</b>. River-woman’s daughter,
<br>Slender as <b>the</b> willow-wand, clearer than <b>the</b> water.
<br>Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing
<br>Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?
<br>Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! <b>and</b> merry-o,
<br>Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!
<br>Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!
<br>Tom’s <b>in</b> a hurry now. Evening will follow day.
<br>Tom’s going home again water-lilies bringing.
<br>Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?
<br>   
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again <b>on</b> stiff branches. There <b>was</b> another burst <b>of</b> song, <b>and</b> then suddenly, hopping <b>and</b> dancing along <b>the</b> path, there appeared above <b>the</b> reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown <b>and</b> a long blue feather stuck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> band. With another hop <b>and</b> a bound there came <b>into</b> view a man, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> seemed. At any rate he <b>was</b> too large <b>and</b> heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People, though he made noise enough for one, slumping along with great yellow boots <b>on</b> his thick legs, <b>and</b> charging through grass <b>and</b> rushes like a cow going down <b>to</b> drink. He <b>had</b> a blue coat <b>and</b> a long brown beard; his eyes were blue <b>and</b> bright, <b>and</b> his face <b>was</b> red as a ripe apple, <b>but</b> creased <b>into</b> a hundred wrinkles <b>of</b> laughter. In his hands he carried <b>on</b> a large leaf as <b>on</b> a tray a small pile <b>of</b> white water-lilies.
<br>   “Help!” cried Frodo <b>and</b> Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out.
<br>   “Whoa! Whoa! steady there!” cried <b>the</b> old man, holding up one hand, <b>and</b> they stopped short, as if they <b>had</b> been struck stiff. “Now, my little fellows, where be you a-going <b>to</b>, puffing like a bellows? What’s <b>the</b> matter here then? Do you know who <b>I</b> am? <b>I</b>’m Tom Bombadil. Tell me <b>what</b>’s your trouble! Tom’s <b>in</b> a hurry now. Don’t you crush my lilies!”
<br>   “My friends are caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> willow-tree,” cried Frodo breathlessly.
<br>   “Master Merry’s being squeezed <b>in</b> a crack!” cried Sam.
<br>   “What?” shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. “Old Man Willow? Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. <b>I</b> know <b>the</b> tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! <b>I</b>’ll freeze his marrow cold, if he don’t behave himself. <b>I</b>’ll sing his roots off. <b>I</b>’ll sing a wind up <b>and</b> blow leaf <b>and</b> branch away. Old Man Willow!” Setting down his lilies carefully <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, he ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tree. There he saw Merry’s feet still sticking out—<b>the</b> rest <b>had</b> already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crack <b>and</b> began singing <b>into</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a low voice. They could not catch <b>the</b> words, <b>but</b> evidently Merry <b>was</b> aroused. His legs began <b>to</b> kick. Tom sprang away, <b>and</b> breaking off a hanging branch smote <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> willow with <b>it</b>. “You let them out again, Old Man Willow!” he said. “What be you a-thinking <b>of</b>? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go <b>to</b> sleep! Bombadil <b>is</b> talking!” He then seized Merry’s feet <b>and</b> drew him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suddenly widening crack.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a tearing creak <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other crack split open, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> Pippin sprang, as if he <b>had</b> been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through <b>the</b> tree from root <b>to</b> tip, <b>and</b> complete silence fell.
<br>   “Thank you!” said <b>the</b> hobbits, one after <b>the</b> other.
<br>   Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. “Well, my little fellows!” said he, stooping so that he peered <b>into</b> their faces. “You shall come home with me! The table <b>is</b> all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, <b>and</b> white bread <b>and</b> butter. Goldberry <b>is</b> waiting. Time enough for questions around <b>the</b> supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!” With that he picked up his lilies, <b>and</b> then with a beckoning wave <b>of</b> his hand went hopping <b>and</b> dancing along <b>the</b> path eastward, still singing loudly <b>and</b> nonsensically.
<br>   Too surprised <b>and</b> too relieved <b>to</b> talk, <b>the</b> hobbits followed after him as fast as they could. But that <b>was</b> not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> his singing got fainter <b>and</b> further away. Suddenly his voice came floating back <b>to</b> them <b>in</b> a loud halloo!
<br>   
<br>Hop along, my little friends, up <b>the</b> Withywindle!
<br>Tom’s going <b>on</b> ahead candles for <b>to</b> kindle.
<br>Down west sinks <b>the</b> Sun: soon you will be groping.
<br>When <b>the</b> night-shadows fall, then <b>the</b> door will open,
<br>Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window-panes light will twinkle yellow.
<br>Fear <b>no</b> alder black! Heed <b>no</b> hoary willow!
<br>Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes <b>on</b> before you.
<br>Hey now! merry dot! We’ll be waiting for you!
<br>   
<br>   After that <b>the</b> hobbits heard <b>no</b> more. Almost at <b>once</b> <b>the</b> sun seemed <b>to</b> sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees behind them. They <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slanting light <b>of</b> evening glittering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine River, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> windows <b>of</b> Bucklebury <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> gleam with hundreds <b>of</b> lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks <b>and</b> branches <b>of</b> trees hung dark <b>and</b> threatening over <b>the</b> path. White mists began <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> curl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> stray about <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees upon its borders. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose <b>and</b> mingled with <b>the</b> swiftly falling dusk.
<br>   It became difficult <b>to</b> follow <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> they were <b>very</b> <b>tired</b>. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> reeds <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> them; <b>and</b> if they looked up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pale sky, they caught sight <b>of</b> queer gnarled <b>and</b> knobbly faces that gloomed dark against <b>the</b> twilight, <b>and</b> leered down at them from <b>the</b> high <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood. They began <b>to</b> feel that all this country <b>was</b> unreal, <b>and</b> that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led <b>to</b> <b>no</b> awakening.
<br>   Just as they felt their feet slowing down <b>to</b> a standstill, they noticed that <b>the</b> ground <b>was</b> gently rising. The water began <b>to</b> murmur. In <b>the</b> darkness they caught <b>the</b> white glimmer <b>of</b> foam, where <b>the</b> river flowed over a short fall. Then suddenly <b>the</b> trees came <b>to</b> an end <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mists were left behind. They stepped out from <b>the</b> Forest, <b>and</b> found a wide sweep <b>of</b> grass welling up before them. The river, now small <b>and</b> swift, <b>was</b> leaping merrily down <b>to</b> meet them, glinting here <b>and</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, which were already shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky.
<br>   The grass under their feet <b>was</b> smooth <b>and</b> short, as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been mown <b>or</b> shaven. The eaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest behind were clipped, <b>and</b> trim as a hedge. The path <b>was</b> now plain before them, well-tended <b>and</b> bordered with stone. It wound up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a grassy knoll, now grey under <b>the</b> pale starry night; <b>and</b> there, still high above them <b>on</b> a further slope, they saw <b>the</b> twinkling lights <b>of</b> a house. Down again <b>the</b> path went, <b>and</b> then up again, up a long smooth hillside <b>of</b> turf, towards <b>the</b> light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that <b>was</b> opened. There <b>was</b> Tom Bombadil’s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind <b>it</b> a steep shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land lay grey <b>and</b> bare, <b>and</b> beyond that <b>the</b> dark shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs stalked away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern night.
<br>   They all hurried forward, hobbits <b>and</b> ponies. Already half their weariness <b>and</b> all their fears <b>had</b> fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol! rolled out <b>the</b> song <b>to</b> greet them.
<br>   
<br>Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!
<br>Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond <b>of</b> parties.
<br>Now let <b>the</b> fun begin! Let us sing together!
<br>   
<br>   Then another clear voice, as young <b>and</b> as ancient as Spring, like <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> a glad water flowing down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night from a bright morning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills, came falling like silver <b>to</b> meet them:
<br>   
<br>Now let <b>the</b> song begin! Let us sing together
<br>Of sun, stars, moon <b>and</b> mist, rain <b>and</b> cloudy weather,
<br>Light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> budding leaf, dew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feather,
<br>Wind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open hill, bells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heather,
<br>Reeds <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shady pool, lilies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water:
<br>Old Tom Bombadil <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River-daughter!
<br>   
<br>   And with that song <b>the</b> hobbits stood upon <b>the</b> threshold, <b>and</b> a golden light <b>was</b> all about them.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 7
<br>IN <b>THE</b> HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL
<br>
<br>   The four hobbits stepped over <b>the</b> wide stone threshold, <b>and</b> stood still, blinking. They were <b>in</b> a long low room, filled with <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> lamps swinging from <b>the</b> beams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof; <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table <b>of</b> dark polished wood stood many candles, tall <b>and</b> yellow, burning brightly.
<br>   In a chair, at <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room facing <b>the</b> outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down <b>her</b> shoulders; <b>her</b> gown <b>was</b> green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads <b>of</b> dew; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> belt <b>was</b> <b>of</b> gold, shaped like a chain <b>of</b> flag-lilies set with <b>the</b> pale-blue eyes <b>of</b> forget-me-nots. About <b>her</b> feel <b>in</b> wide vessels <b>of</b> green <b>and</b> brown earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that <b>she</b> seemed <b>to</b> be enthroned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> a pool.
<br>   “Enter, good guests!” <b>she</b> said, <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> spoke they knew that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> clear voice they <b>had</b> heard singing. They came a few timid steps further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> bow low, feeling strangely surprised <b>and</b> awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door <b>to</b> beg for a drink <b>of</b> water, have been answered <b>by</b> a fair young elf-queen clad <b>in</b> living flowers. But before they could say anything, <b>she</b> sprang lightly up <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> lily-bowls, <b>and</b> ran laughing towards them; <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> ran <b>her</b> gown rustled softly like <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flowering borders <b>of</b> a river.
<br>   “Come dear folk!” <b>she</b> said, taking Frodo <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand. “Laugh <b>and</b> be merry! <b>I</b> am Goldberry, daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River.” Then lightly <b>she</b> passed them <b>and</b> closing <b>the</b> door <b>she</b> turned <b>her</b> back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, with <b>her</b> white arms spread out across <b>it</b>. “Let us shut out <b>the</b> night!” <b>she</b> said. “For you are still afraid, perhaps, <b>of</b> mist <b>and</b> tree-shadows <b>and</b> deep water, <b>and</b> untame things. Fear <b>nothing</b>! For tonight you are under <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil.”
<br>   The hobbits looked at <b>her</b> <b>in</b> wonder; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> looked at each <b>of</b> them <b>and</b> smiled. “Fair lady Goldberry!” said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he <b>had</b> at times stood enchanted <b>by</b> fair elven-voices; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> spell that <b>was</b> now laid upon him <b>was</b> different: less keen <b>and</b> lofty <b>was</b> <b>the</b> delight, <b>but</b> deeper <b>and</b> nearer <b>to</b> mortal heart; marvellous <b>and</b> yet not strange. “Fair lady Goldberry!” he said again. “Now <b>the</b> joy that <b>was</b> hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> songs we heard <b>is</b> made plain <b>to</b> me.
<br>   
<br>O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!
<br>O reed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> living pool! Fair River-daughter!
<br>O spring-time <b>and</b> summer-time, <b>and</b> spring again after!
<br>O wind <b>on</b> <b>the</b> waterfall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves” laughter!”
<br>   
<br>   Suddenly he stopped <b>and</b> stammered, overcome with surprise <b>to</b> hear himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.
<br>   “Welcome!” <b>she</b> said. “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> not heard that folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire were so sweet-tongued. But <b>I</b> see you are an elf-friend; <b>the</b> light <b>in</b> your eyes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>in</b> your voice tells <b>it</b>. This <b>is</b> a merry meeting! Sit now, <b>and</b> wait for <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house! He will not be long. He <b>is</b> tending your <b>tired</b> beasts.”
<br>   The hobbits sat down gladly <b>in</b> low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> their eyes followed <b>her</b>, for <b>the</b> slender grace <b>of</b> <b>her</b> movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind <b>the</b> house came <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> singing. Every now <b>and</b> again they caught, among many a derry dol <b>and</b> a merry dol <b>and</b> a ring a ding dillo <b>the</b> repeated words:
<br>   
<br>Old Tom Bombadil <b>is</b> a merry fellow;
<br>Bright blue his jacket <b>is</b>, <b>and</b> his boots are yellow.
<br>   
<br>   “Fair lady!” said Frodo again after a while. “Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who <b>is</b> Tom Bombadil?”
<br>   “He <b>is</b>,” said Goldberry, staying <b>her</b> swift movements <b>and</b> smiling.
<br>   Frodo looked at <b>her</b> questioningly. “He <b>is</b>, as you have seen him,” <b>she</b> said <b>in</b> answer <b>to</b> his look. “He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> wood, water, <b>and</b> hill.”
<br>   “Then all this strange land belongs <b>to</b> him?”
<br>   “No indeed!” <b>she</b> answered, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> smile faded. “That would indeed be a burden,” <b>she</b> added <b>in</b> a low voice, as if <b>to</b> herself. “The trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grasses <b>and</b> all things growing <b>or</b> living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land belong each <b>to</b> themselves. Tom Bombadil <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Master. No one has ever caught old Tom walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest, wading <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, leaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops under light <b>and</b> shadow. He has <b>no</b> fear. Tom Bombadil <b>is</b> master.”
<br>   A door opened <b>and</b> <b>in</b> came Tom Bombadil. He <b>had</b> now <b>no</b> hat <b>and</b> his thick brown hair <b>was</b> crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, <b>and</b> going <b>to</b> Goldberry, took <b>her</b> hand.
<br>   “Here’s my pretty lady!” he said, bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Here’s my Goldberry clothed all <b>in</b> silver-green with flowers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> girdle! Is <b>the</b> table laden? <b>I</b> see yellow cream <b>and</b> honeycomb, <b>and</b> white bread, <b>and</b> butter; milk, cheese, <b>and</b> green herbs <b>and</b> ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is <b>the</b> supper ready?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b>,” said Goldberry; “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> guests perhaps are not?”
<br>   Tom clapped his hands <b>and</b> cried: “Tom, Tom! your guests are <b>tired</b>, <b>and</b> you <b>had</b> near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, <b>and</b> Tom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, <b>and</b> wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks <b>and</b> comb out your tangles!”
<br>   He opened <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> they followed him down a short passage <b>and</b> round a sharp turn. They came <b>to</b> a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, <b>it</b> seemed, built <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house). Its walls were <b>of</b> clean stone, <b>but</b> they were mostly covered with green hanging mats <b>and</b> yellow curtains. The floor <b>was</b> flagged, <b>and</b> strewn with fresh green rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor along one side. Against <b>the</b> opposite wall <b>was</b> a long bench laden with wide earthenware basins, <b>and</b> beside <b>it</b> stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set ready beside each bed.
<br>   Before long, washed <b>and</b> refreshed, <b>the</b> hobbits were seated at <b>the</b> table, two <b>on</b> each side, while at either end sat Goldberry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Master. It <b>was</b> a long <b>and</b> merry meal. Though <b>the</b> hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> lack. The drink <b>in</b> their drinking-bowls seemed <b>to</b> be clear cold water, yet <b>it</b> went <b>to</b> their hearts like wine <b>and</b> set free their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> easier <b>and</b> more natural than talking.
<br>   At last Tom <b>and</b> Goldberry rose <b>and</b> cleared <b>the</b> table swiftly. The guests were commanded <b>to</b> sit quiet, <b>and</b> were set <b>in</b> chairs, each with a footstool <b>to</b> his <b>tired</b> feet. There <b>was</b> a fire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide hearth before them, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> burning with a sweet smell, as if <b>it</b> were built <b>of</b> apple-wood. When everything <b>was</b> set <b>in</b> order, all <b>the</b> lights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room were put out, except one lamp <b>and</b> a pair <b>of</b> candles at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came <b>and</b> stood before them, holding a candle; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> wished them each a good night <b>and</b> deep sleep.
<br>   “Have peace now,” <b>she</b> said, “until <b>the</b> morning! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noises! For <b>nothing</b> passes door <b>and</b> window here save moonlight <b>and</b> starlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind off <b>the</b> hill-top. Good night!” She passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room with a glimmer <b>and</b> a rustle. The sound <b>of</b> <b>her</b> footsteps <b>was</b> like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiet <b>of</b> night.
<br>   Tom sat <b>on</b> a while beside them <b>in</b> silence, while each <b>of</b> them tried <b>to</b> muster <b>the</b> courage <b>to</b> ask one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many questions he <b>had</b> meant <b>to</b> ask at supper. Sleep gathered <b>on</b> their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:
<br>   “Did you hear me calling, Master, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> just chance that brought you at that moment?”
<br>   Tom stirred like a man shaken out <b>of</b> a pleasant dream. “Eh, <b>what</b>?” said he. “Did <b>I</b> hear you calling? Nay, <b>I</b> did not hear: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> busy singing. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> plan <b>of</b> mine, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting for you. We heard news <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> learned that you were wandering. We guessed you’d come ere long down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water: all paths lead that way, down <b>to</b> Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s a mighty singer; <b>and</b> <b>it</b>’s hard for little folk <b>to</b> escape his cunning mazes. But Tom <b>had</b> an errand there, that he dared not hinder.” Tom nodded as if sleep <b>was</b> taking him again; <b>but</b> he went <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a soft singing voice:
<br>   
<br><b>I</b> <b>had</b> an errand there: gathering water-lilies,
<br>green leaves <b>and</b> lilies white <b>to</b> please my pretty lady,
<br><b>the</b> last ere <b>the</b> year’s end <b>to</b> keep them from <b>the</b> winter,
<br><b>to</b> flower <b>by</b> <b>her</b> pretty feet tilt <b>the</b> snows are melted.
<br>Each year at summer’s end <b>I</b> go <b>to</b> find them for <b>her</b>,
<br><b>in</b> a wide pool, deep <b>and</b> clear, far down Withywindle;
<br>there they open first <b>in</b> spring <b>and</b> there they linger latest.
<br>By that pool long ago <b>I</b> found <b>the</b> River-daughter,
<br>fair young Goldberry <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rushes.
<br>Sweet <b>was</b> <b>her</b> singing then, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> heart <b>was</b> beating!
<br>   
<br>   He opened his eyes <b>and</b> looked at them with a sudden glint <b>of</b> blue:
<br>   
<br>And that proved well for you—for now <b>I</b> shall <b>no</b> longer
<br>go down deep again along <b>the</b> forest-water,
<br>not while <b>the</b> year <b>is</b> old. Nor shall <b>I</b> be passing
<br>Old Man Willow’s house this side <b>of</b> spring-time,
<br>not till <b>the</b> merry spring, when <b>the</b> River-daughter
<br>dances down <b>the</b> withy-path <b>to</b> bathe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   
<br>   He fell silent again; <b>but</b> Frodo could not help asking one more question: <b>the</b> one he most desired <b>to</b> have answered. “Tell us, Master,” he said, “about <b>the</b> Willow-man. What <b>is</b> he? <b>I</b> have never heard <b>of</b> him before.”
<br>   “No, don’t!” said Merry <b>and</b> Pippin together, <b>sitting</b> suddenly upright. “Not now! Not until <b>the</b> morning!”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> right!” said <b>the</b> old man. “Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time for resting. Some things are ill <b>to</b> hear when <b>the</b> world’s <b>in</b> shadow. Sleep till <b>the</b> morning-light, rest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillow! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noise! Fear <b>no</b> grey willow!” And with that he took down <b>the</b> lamp <b>and</b> blew <b>it</b> out, <b>and</b> grasping a candle <b>in</b> either hand he led them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.
<br>   Their mattresses <b>and</b> pillows were soft as down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blankets were <b>of</b> white wool. They <b>had</b> hardly laid themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deep beds <b>and</b> drawn <b>the</b> light covers over them before they were asleep.
<br>   In <b>the</b> dead night, Frodo lay <b>in</b> a dream <b>without</b> light. Then he saw <b>the</b> young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall <b>of</b> rock, pierced <b>by</b> a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that he <b>was</b> lifted up, <b>and</b> passing over he saw that <b>the</b> rock-wall <b>was</b> a circle <b>of</b> hills, <b>and</b> that within <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a plain, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plain stood a pinnacle <b>of</b> stone, like a vast tower <b>but</b> not made <b>by</b> hands. On its top stood <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> a man. The moon as <b>it</b> rose seemed <b>to</b> hang for a moment above his head <b>and</b> glistened <b>in</b> his white hair as <b>the</b> wind stirred <b>it</b>. Up from <b>the</b> dark plain below came <b>the</b> crying <b>of</b> fell voices, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> howling <b>of</b> many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> great wings, passed across <b>the</b> moon. The figure lifted his arms <b>and</b> a light flashed from <b>the</b> staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down <b>and</b> bore him away. The voices wailed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wolves yammered. There <b>was</b> a noise like a strong wind blowing, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> borne <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from <b>the</b> East. “Black Riders!” <b>thought</b> Frodo as he wakened, with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hoofs still echoing <b>in</b> his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have <b>the</b> courage <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> these stone walls. He lay motionless, still listening; <b>but</b> all <b>was</b> now silent, <b>and</b> at last he turned <b>and</b> fell asleep again <b>or</b> wandered <b>into</b> some other unremembered dream.
<br>   At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; <b>but</b> a change came over his dreams <b>and</b> he turned <b>and</b> groaned. Suddenly he woke, <b>or</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>had</b> waked, <b>and</b> yet still heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>the</b> sound that <b>had</b> disturbed his dream: tip-tap, squeak: <b>the</b> noise <b>was</b> like branches fretting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, twig-fingers scraping wall <b>and</b> window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if there were willow-trees close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; <b>and</b> then suddenly he <b>had</b> a dreadful feeling that he <b>was</b> not <b>in</b> an ordinary house at all, <b>but</b> inside <b>the</b> willow <b>and</b> listening <b>to</b> that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He sat up, <b>and</b> felt <b>the</b> soft pillows yield <b>to</b> his hands, <b>and</b> he lay down again relieved. He seemed <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> echo <b>of</b> words <b>in</b> his ears: “Fear <b>nothing</b>! Have peace until <b>the</b> morning! Heed <b>no</b> nightly noises!” Then he went <b>to</b> sleep again.
<br>   It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> water that Merry heard falling <b>into</b> his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, <b>and</b> then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round <b>the</b> house <b>into</b> a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> rising slowly <b>but</b> surely. “<b>I</b> shall be drowned!” he <b>thought</b>. It will find its way <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> shall drown.” He felt that he <b>was</b> lying <b>in</b> a soft slimy bog, <b>and</b> springing up he set his fool <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he <b>was</b> <b>and</b> lay down again. He seemed <b>to</b> hear <b>or</b> remember hearing: “Nothing passes doors <b>or</b> windows save moonlight <b>and</b> starlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind off <b>the</b> hill-top.” A little breath <b>of</b> sweet air moved <b>the</b> curtain. He breathed deep <b>and</b> fell asleep again.
<br>   As far as he could remember, Sam slept through <b>the</b> night <b>in</b> deep content, if logs are contented.
<br>   They woke up, all four at <b>once</b>, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning light. Tom <b>was</b> moving about <b>the</b> room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, <b>and</b> cried: “Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!” He drew back <b>the</b> yellow curtains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits saw that these <b>had</b> covered <b>the</b> windows, at either end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, one looking east <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other looking west.
<br>   They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern window, <b>and</b> found himself looking <b>into</b> a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He <b>had</b> half expected <b>to</b> see turf right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually his view <b>was</b> screened <b>by</b> a tall line <b>of</b> beans <b>on</b> poles; <b>but</b> above <b>and</b> far beyond them <b>the</b> grey top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill loomed up against <b>the</b> sunrise. It <b>was</b> a pale morning: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East, behind long clouds like lines <b>of</b> soiled wool stained red at <b>the</b> edges, lay glimmering deeps <b>of</b> yellow. The sky spoke <b>of</b> rain <b>to</b> come; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> light <b>was</b> broadening quickly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> red flowers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beans began <b>to</b> glow against <b>the</b> wet green leaves.
<br>   Pippin looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western window, down <b>into</b> a pool <b>of</b> mist. The Forest <b>was</b> hidden under a fog. It <b>was</b> like looking down <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a sloping cloud-roof from above. There <b>was</b> a fold <b>or</b> channel where <b>the</b> mist <b>was</b> broken <b>into</b> many plumes <b>and</b> billows; <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle. The stream ran down <b>the</b> hill <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> vanished <b>into</b> <b>the</b> white shadows. Near at hand <b>was</b> a flower-garden <b>and</b> a clipped hedge silver-netted, <b>and</b> beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> willow-tree <b>to</b> be seen.
<br>   “Good morning, merry friends!” cried Tom, opening <b>the</b> eastern window wide. A cool air flowed <b>in</b>; <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a rainy smell. “Sun won’t show <b>her</b> face much today. <b>I</b>’m thinking. <b>I</b> have been walking wide, leaping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilltops, since <b>the</b> grey dawn began, nosing wind <b>and</b> weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. <b>I</b> wakened Goldberry singing under window; <b>but</b> nought wakes hobbit-folk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early morning. In <b>the</b> night little folk wake up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget <b>the</b> nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come soon you’ll find breakfast <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. If you come late you’ll <b>get</b> grass <b>and</b> rain-water!”
<br>   Needless <b>to</b> say—not that Tom’s threat sounded <b>very</b> serious—<b>the</b> hobbits came soon, <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> table late <b>and</b> only when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> lo look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about <b>the</b> house, clattering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, <b>and</b> up <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> stairs, <b>and</b> singing here <b>and</b> there outside. The room looked westward over <b>the</b> mist-clouded valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> window <b>was</b> open. Water dripped down from <b>the</b> thatched eaves above. Before they <b>had</b> finished breakfast <b>the</b> clouds <b>had</b> joined <b>into</b> an unbroken roof, <b>and</b> a straight grey rain came softly <b>and</b> steadily down. Behind its deep curtain <b>the</b> Forest <b>was</b> completely veiled.
<br>   As they looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window there came falling gently as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flowing down <b>the</b> rain out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>the</b> clear voice <b>of</b> Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed plain <b>to</b> them that <b>the</b> song <b>was</b> a rain-song, as sweet as showers <b>on</b> dry hills, that told <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> a river from <b>the</b> spring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highlands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea far below. The hobbits listened with delight; <b>and</b> Frodo <b>was</b> glad <b>in</b> his heart, <b>and</b> blessed <b>the</b> kindly weather, because <b>it</b> delayed them from departing. The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going <b>had</b> been heavy upon him from <b>the</b> moment he awoke; <b>but</b> he guessed now that they would not go further that day.
<br>   The upper wind settled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> deeper <b>and</b> wetter clouds rolled up <b>to</b> spill their laden rain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bare heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs. Nothing could be seen all round <b>the</b> house <b>but</b> falling water. Frodo stood near <b>the</b> open door <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> white chalky path turn <b>into</b> a little river <b>of</b> milk <b>and</b> go bubbling away down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, waving his arms as if he <b>was</b> warding off <b>the</b> rain—<b>and</b> indeed when he sprang over <b>the</b> threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his boots. These he took off <b>and</b> put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chimney-corner. Then he sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> largest chair <b>and</b> called <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> gather round him.
<br>   “This <b>is</b> Goldberry’s washing day,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>her</b> autumn-cleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk—let them rest while they are able! It’s a good day for long tales, for questions <b>and</b> for answers, so Tom will start <b>the</b> talking.”
<br>   He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking <b>to</b> himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn <b>to</b> song, <b>and</b> he would <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> his chair <b>and</b> dance about. He told them tales <b>of</b> bees <b>and</b> flowers, <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> strange creatures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, about <b>the</b> evil things <b>and</b> good things, things friendly <b>and</b> things unfriendly, cruel things <b>and</b> kind things, <b>and</b> secrets hidden under brambles.
<br>   As they listened, they began <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest, apart from themselves, indeed <b>to</b> feel themselves as <b>the</b> strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> his talk <b>was</b> Old Man Willow, <b>and</b> Frodo learned now enough <b>to</b> content him, indeed more than enough, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> their thoughts, which were often dark <b>and</b> strange, <b>and</b> filled with a hatred <b>of</b> things that go free upon <b>the</b> earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers <b>and</b> usurpers. It <b>was</b> not called <b>the</b> Old Forest <b>without</b> reason, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> indeed ancient, a survivor <b>of</b> vast forgotten woods; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> there lived yet, ageing <b>no</b> quicker than <b>the</b> hills, <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years <b>had</b> filled them with pride <b>and</b> rooted wisdom, <b>and</b> with malice. But none were more dangerous than <b>the</b> Great Willow: his heart <b>was</b> rotten, <b>but</b> his strength <b>was</b> green; <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> cunning, <b>and</b> a master <b>of</b> winds, <b>and</b> his song <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> ran through <b>the</b> woods <b>on</b> both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth <b>and</b> spread like fine root-threads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> invisible twig-fingers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, till <b>it</b> <b>had</b> under its dominion nearly all <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest from <b>the</b> Hedge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs.
<br>   Suddenly Tom’s talk left <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> went leaping up <b>the</b> young stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles <b>and</b> worn rocks, <b>and</b> among small flowers <b>in</b> close grass <b>and</b> wet crannies, wandering at last up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs. They heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Barrows, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> green mounds, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone-rings upon <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollows among <b>the</b> hills. Sheep were bleating <b>in</b> flocks. Green walls <b>and</b> white walls rose. There were fortresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heights. Kings <b>of</b> little kingdoms fought together, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young Sun shone like fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> red metal <b>of</b> their new <b>and</b> greedy swords. There <b>was</b> victory <b>and</b> defeat; <b>and</b> towers fell, fortresses were burned, <b>and</b> flames went up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky. Gold <b>was</b> piled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> biers <b>of</b> dead kings <b>and</b> queens; <b>and</b> mounds covered them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone doors were shut; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while biting <b>the</b> grass, <b>but</b> soon <b>the</b> hills were empty again. A shadow came out <b>of</b> dark places far away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bones were stirred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mounds. Barrow-wights walked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollow places with a clink <b>of</b> rings <b>on</b> cold fingers, <b>and</b> gold chains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind.” Stone rings grinned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground like broken teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight.
<br>   The hobbits shuddered. Even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>the</b> rumour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs beyond <b>the</b> Forest <b>had</b> been heard. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a tale that any hobbit liked <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b>, even <b>by</b> a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered <b>what</b> <b>the</b> joy <b>of</b> this house <b>had</b> driven from their minds: <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil nestled under <b>the</b> <b>very</b> shoulder <b>of</b> those dreaded hills. They lost <b>the</b> thread <b>of</b> his tale <b>and</b> shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.
<br>   When they caught his words again they found that he <b>had</b> now wandered <b>into</b> strange regions beyond their memory <b>and</b> beyond their waking <b>thought</b>, <b>into</b> limes when <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> wider, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seas flowed straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western Shore; <b>and</b> still <b>on</b> <b>and</b> back Tom went singing out <b>into</b> ancient starlight, when only <b>the</b> Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, <b>and</b> they saw that he nodded as if he <b>was</b> falling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed as if, under <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> his words, <b>the</b> wind <b>had</b> gone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clouds <b>had</b> dried up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day <b>had</b> been withdrawn, <b>and</b> darkness <b>had</b> come from East <b>and</b> West, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> filled with <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> white stars.
<br>   Whether <b>the</b> morning <b>and</b> evening <b>of</b> one day <b>or</b> <b>of</b> many days <b>had</b> passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry <b>or</b> <b>tired</b>, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through <b>the</b> window <b>and</b> <b>the</b> silence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavens seemed <b>to</b> be round him. He spoke at last out <b>of</b> his wonder <b>and</b> a sudden fear <b>of</b> that silence:
<br>   “Who are you, Master?” he asked.
<br>   “Eh, <b>what</b>?” said Tom <b>sitting</b> up, <b>and</b> his eyes glinting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom. “Don’t you know my name yet? That’s <b>the</b> only answer. Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself <b>and</b> nameless? But you are young <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am old. Eldest, that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom <b>was</b> here before <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees; Tom remembers <b>the</b> first raindrop <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first acorn. He made paths before <b>the</b> Big People, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> little People arriving. He <b>was</b> here before <b>the</b> Kings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> graves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights. When <b>the</b> Elves passed westward, Tom <b>was</b> here already, before <b>the</b> seas were bent. He knew <b>the</b> dark under <b>the</b> stars when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fearless—before <b>the</b> Dark Lord came from Outside.”
<br>   A shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass <b>by</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits glanced hastily through <b>the</b> panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> door behind, framed <b>in</b> light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from <b>the</b> draught with <b>her</b> hand; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light flowed through <b>it</b>, like sunlight through a white shell.
<br>   “The rain has ended,” <b>she</b> said; “<b>and</b> new waters are running downhill, under <b>the</b> stars. Let us now laugh <b>and</b> be glad!”
<br>   “And let us have food <b>and</b> drink!” cried Tom. “Long tales are thirsty. And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, <b>and</b> evening!” With that he jumped out <b>of</b> his chair, <b>and</b> with a bound took a candle from <b>the</b> chimney-shelf <b>and</b> lit <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flame that Goldberry held; then he danced about <b>the</b> table. Suddenly he hopped through <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> disappeared.
<br>   Quickly he returned, bearing a large <b>and</b> laden tray. Then Tom <b>and</b> Goldberry set <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits sat half <b>in</b> wonder <b>and</b> half <b>in</b> laughter: so fair <b>was</b> <b>the</b> grace <b>of</b> Goldberry <b>and</b> so merry <b>and</b> odd <b>the</b> caperings <b>of</b> Tom. Yet <b>in</b> some fashion they seemed <b>to</b> weave a single dance, neither hindering <b>the</b> other, <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> round about <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> with great speed food <b>and</b> vessels <b>and</b> lights were set <b>in</b> order. The boards blazed with candles, white <b>and</b> yellow. Tom bowed <b>to</b> his guests. “Supper <b>is</b> ready,” said Goldberry; <b>and</b> now <b>the</b> hobbits saw that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> clothed all <b>in</b> silver with a white girdle, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> shoes were like fishes” mail. But Tom <b>was</b> all <b>in</b> clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> green stockings.
<br>   It <b>was</b> a supper even better than before. The hobbits under <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> Tom’s words may have missed one meal <b>or</b> many, <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> food <b>was</b> before them <b>it</b> seemed at least a week since they <b>had</b> eaten. They did not sing <b>or</b> even speak much for a while, <b>and</b> paid close attention <b>to</b> business. But after a time their hearts <b>and</b> spirit rose high again, <b>and</b> their voices rang out <b>in</b> mirth <b>and</b> laughter.
<br>   After they <b>had</b> eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills <b>and</b> fell softly down <b>into</b> silence; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> silences they saw <b>in</b> their minds pools <b>and</b> waters wider than any they <b>had</b> known, <b>and</b> looking <b>into</b> them they saw <b>the</b> sky below them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars like jewels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths. Then <b>once</b> more <b>she</b> wished them each good night <b>and</b> left them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake <b>and</b> plied them with questions.
<br>   He appeared already <b>to</b> know much about them <b>and</b> all their families, <b>and</b> indeed <b>to</b> know much <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> history <b>and</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire down from days hardly remembered among <b>the</b> hobbits themselves. It <b>no</b> longer surprised them; <b>but</b> he made <b>no</b> secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely <b>to</b> Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed <b>to</b> regard as a person <b>of</b> more importance than they <b>had</b> imagined. “There’s earth under his old feet, <b>and</b> clay <b>on</b> his fingers; wisdom <b>in</b> his bones, <b>and</b> both his eyes are open,” said Tom. It <b>was</b> also clear that Tom <b>had</b> dealings with <b>the</b> Elves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed that <b>in</b> some fashion, news <b>had</b> reached him from Gildor concerning <b>the</b> flight <b>of</b> Frodo.
<br>   Indeed so much did Tom know, <b>and</b> so cunning <b>was</b> his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo <b>and</b> his own hopes <b>and</b> fears than he <b>had</b> told before even <b>to</b> Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a glint <b>in</b> his eyes when he heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders.
<br>   “Show me <b>the</b> precious Ring!” he said suddenly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story: <b>and</b> Frodo, <b>to</b> his own astonishment, drew out <b>the</b> chain from his pocket, <b>and</b> unfastening <b>the</b> Ring handed <b>it</b> at <b>once</b> <b>to</b> Tom.
<br>   It seemed <b>to</b> grow larger as <b>it</b> lay for a moment <b>on</b> his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his eye <b>and</b> laughed. For a second <b>the</b> hobbits <b>had</b> a vision, both comical <b>and</b> alarming, <b>of</b> his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle <b>of</b> gold. Then Tom put <b>the</b> Ring round <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his little finger <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> candlelight. For a moment <b>the</b> hobbits noticed <b>nothing</b> strange about this. Then they gasped. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Tom disappearing!
<br>   Tom laughed again, <b>and</b> then he spun <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air—<b>and</b> <b>it</b> vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry—<b>and</b> Tom leaned forward <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> him with a smile.
<br>   Frodo looked at <b>it</b> closely, <b>and</b> rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket <b>to</b> a juggler). It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same Ring, <b>or</b> looked <b>the</b> same <b>and</b> weighed <b>the</b> same: for that Ring <b>had</b> always seemed <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> weigh strangely heavy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hand. But something prompted him <b>to</b> make sure. He <b>was</b> perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming <b>to</b> make so light <b>of</b> <b>what</b> even Gandalf <b>thought</b> so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when <b>the</b> talk <b>was</b> going again, <b>and</b> Tom <b>was</b> telling an absurd story about badgers <b>and</b> their queer ways—then he slipped <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b>.
<br>   Merry turned towards him <b>to</b> say something <b>and</b> gave a start, <b>and</b> checked an exclamation. Frodo <b>was</b> delighted (<b>in</b> a way): <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his own ring all right, for Merry <b>was</b> staring blankly at his chair, <b>and</b> obviously could not see him. He got up <b>and</b> crept quietly away from <b>the</b> fireside towards <b>the</b> outer door.
<br>   “Hey there!” cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look <b>in</b> his shining eyes. “Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand’s more fair <b>without</b> <b>it</b>. Come back! Leave your game <b>and</b> sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, <b>and</b> think about <b>the</b> morning. Tom must teach <b>the</b> right road, <b>and</b> keep your feet from wandering.”
<br>   Frodo laughed (trying <b>to</b> feel pleased), <b>and</b> taking off <b>the</b> Ring he came <b>and</b> sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned <b>the</b> Sun would shine tomorrow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would be a glad morning, <b>and</b> setting out would be hopeful. But they would <b>do</b> well <b>to</b> start early; for weather <b>in</b> that country <b>was</b> a thing that even Tom could not be sure <b>of</b> for long, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. “<b>I</b> am <b>no</b> weather-master,” he said; “nor <b>is</b> aught that goes <b>on</b> two legs.”
<br>   By his advice they decided <b>to</b> make nearly due North from his house, over <b>the</b> western <b>and</b> lower slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs: they might hope <b>in</b> that way <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> East Road <b>in</b> a day’s journey, <b>and</b> avoid <b>the</b> Barrows. He told them not <b>to</b> be afraid—<b>but</b> <b>to</b> mind their own business.
<br>   “Keep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> green grass. Don’t you go a-meddling with old stone <b>or</b> cold Wights <b>or</b> prying <b>in</b> their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never falter!” He said this more than <b>once</b>; <b>and</b> he advised them <b>to</b> pass barrows <b>by</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west-side, if they chanced <b>to</b> stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme <b>to</b> sing, if they should <b>by</b> ill-luck fall <b>into</b> any danger <b>or</b> difficulty <b>the</b> next day.
<br>   
<br>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>By water, wood <b>and</b> hill, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reed <b>and</b> willow,
<br>By fire, sun <b>and</b> moon, harken now <b>and</b> hear us!
<br>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need <b>is</b> near us!
<br>   
<br>   When they <b>had</b> sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder with a laugh, <b>and</b> taking candles led them back <b>to</b> their bedroom.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 8
<br>FOG ON <b>THE</b> BARROW-DOWNS
<br>
<br>   That night they heard <b>no</b> noises. But either <b>in</b> his dreams <b>or</b> out <b>of</b> them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running <b>in</b> his mind; a song that seemed <b>to</b> come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, <b>and</b> growing stronger <b>to</b> turn <b>the</b> veil all <b>to</b> glass <b>and</b> silver, until at last <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rolled back, <b>and</b> a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.
<br>   The vision melted <b>into</b> waking; <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> Tom whistling like a tree-full <b>of</b> birds; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> already slanting down <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> through <b>the</b> open window. Outside everything <b>was</b> green <b>and</b> pale gold.
<br>   After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready <b>to</b> say farewell, as nearly heavy <b>of</b> heart as <b>was</b> possible <b>on</b> such a morning: cool, bright, <b>and</b> clean under a washed autumn sky <b>of</b> thin blue. The air came fresh from <b>the</b> North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing <b>and</b> moving restlessly. Tom came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> waved his hat <b>and</b> danced upon <b>the</b> doorstep, bidding <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up <b>and</b> be off <b>and</b> go with good speed.
<br>   They rode off along a path that wound away from behind <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> went slanting up towards <b>the</b> north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-brow under which <b>it</b> sheltered. They <b>had</b> just dismounted <b>to</b> lead their ponies up <b>the</b> last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.
<br>   “Goldberry!” he cried. “My fair lady, clad all <b>in</b> silver green! We have never said farewell <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, nor seen <b>her</b> since <b>the</b> evening!” He <b>was</b> so distressed that he turned back; <b>but</b> at that moment a clear call came rippling down. There <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-brow <b>she</b> stood beckoning <b>to</b> them: <b>her</b> hair <b>was</b> flying loose, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> caught <b>the</b> sun <b>it</b> shone <b>and</b> shimmered. A light like <b>the</b> glint <b>of</b> water <b>on</b> dewy grass flashed from under <b>her</b> feet as <b>she</b> danced.
<br>   They hastened up <b>the</b> last slope, <b>and</b> stood breathless beside <b>her</b>. They bowed, <b>but</b> with a wave <b>of</b> <b>her</b> arm <b>she</b> bade them look round; <b>and</b> they looked out from <b>the</b> hill-top over lands under <b>the</b> morning. It <b>was</b> now as clear <b>and</b> far-seen as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been veiled <b>and</b> misty when they stood upon <b>the</b> knoll <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest, which could now be seen rising pale <b>and</b> green out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West. In that direction <b>the</b> land rose <b>in</b> wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under <b>the</b> sun, beyond which lay hidden <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine. To <b>the</b> South, over <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Withywindle, there <b>was</b> a distant glint like pale glass where <b>the</b> Brandywine River made a great loop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowlands <b>and</b> flowed away out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. Northward beyond <b>the</b> dwindling downs <b>the</b> land ran away <b>in</b> flats <b>and</b> swellings <b>of</b> grey <b>and</b> green <b>and</b> pale earth-colours, until <b>it</b> faded <b>into</b> a featureless <b>and</b> shadowy distance. Eastward <b>the</b> Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> morning, <b>and</b> vanished out <b>of</b> eyesight <b>into</b> a guess: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> more than a guess <b>of</b> blue <b>and</b> a remote white glimmer blending with <b>the</b> hem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> spoke <b>to</b> them, out <b>of</b> memory <b>and</b> old tales, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high <b>and</b> distant mountains.
<br>   They took a deep draught <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> felt that a skip <b>and</b> a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted <b>to</b> go jogging aside over <b>the</b> crumpled skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downs towards <b>the</b> Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over <b>the</b> stepping stones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills straight towards <b>the</b> Mountains.
<br>   Goldberry spoke <b>to</b> them <b>and</b> recalled their eyes <b>and</b> thoughts. “Speed now, fair guests!” <b>she</b> said. “And hold <b>to</b> your purpose! North with <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left eye <b>and</b> a blessing <b>on</b> your footsteps! Make haste while <b>the</b> Sun shines!” And <b>to</b> Frodo <b>she</b> said: “Farewell, Elf-friend, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a merry meeting!”
<br>   But Frodo found <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> answer. He bowed low, <b>and</b> mounted his pony, <b>and</b> followed <b>by</b> his friends jogged slowly down <b>the</b> gentle slope behind <b>the</b> hill. Tom Bombadil's house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Forest were lost <b>to</b> view. The air grew warmer between <b>the</b> green walls <b>of</b> hillside <b>and</b> hillside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> turf rose strong <b>and</b> sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small <b>and</b> slender like a sunlit flower against <b>the</b> sky: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> standing still watching them, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked <b>she</b> gave a clear call, <b>and</b> lifting up <b>her</b> hand <b>she</b> turned <b>and</b> vanished behind <b>the</b> hill.
<br>   Their way wound along <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hollow, <b>and</b> round <b>the</b> green feet <b>of</b> a steep hill <b>into</b> another deeper <b>and</b> broader valley, <b>and</b> then over <b>the</b> shoulder <b>of</b> further hills, <b>and</b> down their long limbs, <b>and</b> up their smooth sides again, up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> new hill-tops <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> new valleys. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> tree nor any visible water: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a country <b>of</b> grass <b>and</b> short springy turf, silent except for <b>the</b> whisper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air over <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> high lonely cries <b>of</b> strange birds. As they journeyed <b>the</b> sun mounted, <b>and</b> grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge <b>the</b> breeze seemed <b>to</b> have grown less. When they caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country westward <b>the</b> distant Forest seemed <b>to</b> be smoking, as if <b>the</b> fallen rain <b>was</b> steaming up again from leaf <b>and</b> root <b>and</b> mould. A shadow now lay round <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> sight, a dark haze above which <b>the</b> upper sky <b>was</b> like a blue cap, hot <b>and</b> heavy.
<br>   About mid-day they came <b>to</b> a hill whose top <b>was</b> wide <b>and</b> flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> air stirring, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky seemed near their heads. They rode across <b>and</b> looked northwards. Then their hearts rose, for <b>it</b> seemed plain that they <b>had</b> come further already than they <b>had</b> expected. Certainly <b>the</b> distances <b>had</b> now all become hazy <b>and</b> deceptive, <b>but</b> there could be <b>no</b> doubt that <b>the</b> Downs were coming <b>to</b> an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, until <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line. That <b>is</b> a line <b>of</b> trees,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> that must mark <b>the</b> Road. All along <b>it</b> for many leagues east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old days.”
<br>   “Splendid!” said Frodo. “If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left <b>the</b> Downs before <b>the</b> Sun sets <b>and</b> be jogging <b>on</b> <b>in</b> search <b>of</b> a camping place.” But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, <b>and</b> he saw that <b>on</b> that side <b>the</b> hills were higher <b>and</b> looked down upon them; <b>and</b> all those hills were crowned with green mounds, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out <b>of</b> green gums.
<br>   That view <b>was</b> somehow disquieting; so they turned from <b>the</b> sight <b>and</b> went down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hollow circle. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there stood a single stone, standing tall under <b>the</b> sun above, <b>and</b> at this hour casting <b>no</b> shadow. It <b>was</b> shapeless <b>and</b> yet significant: like a landmark, <b>or</b> a guarding finger, <b>or</b> more like a warning. But they were now hungry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> still at <b>the</b> fearless noon; so they set their backs against <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stone. It <b>was</b> cool, as if <b>the</b> sun <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> power <b>to</b> warm <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> made as good a noon-meal under <b>the</b> open sky as anyone could wish; for <b>the</b> food came from “down under Hill”. Tom <b>had</b> provided them with plenty for <b>the</b> comfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   Riding over <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> eating their fill, <b>the</b> warm sun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs <b>and</b> looking at <b>the</b> sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough <b>to</b> explain <b>what</b> happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly <b>and</b> uncomfortably from a sleep they <b>had</b> never meant <b>to</b> take. The standing stone <b>was</b> cold, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale <b>and</b> watery yellow, <b>was</b> gleaming through <b>the</b> mist just above <b>the</b> west wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hollow <b>in</b> which they lay; north, south, <b>and</b> east, beyond <b>the</b> wall <b>the</b> fog <b>was</b> thick, cold <b>and</b> white. The air <b>was</b> silent, heavy <b>and</b> chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down.
<br>   The hobbits sprang <b>to</b> their feet <b>in</b> alarm, <b>and</b> ran <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western rim. They found that they were upon an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fog. Even as they looked out <b>in</b> dismay towards <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>it</b> sank before their eyes <b>into</b> a white sea, <b>and</b> a cold grey shadow sprang up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East behind. The fog rolled up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>and</b> rose above them, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> mounted <b>it</b> bent over their heads until <b>it</b> became a roof: they were shut <b>in</b> a hall <b>of</b> mist whose central pillar <b>was</b> <b>the</b> standing stone.
<br>   They felt as if a trap <b>was</b> closing about them; <b>but</b> they did not quite lose heart. They still remembered <b>the</b> hopeful view they <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road ahead, <b>and</b> they still knew <b>in</b> which direction <b>it</b> lay. In any case, they now <b>had</b> so great a dislike for that hollow place about <b>the</b> stone that <b>no</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> remaining there <b>was</b> <b>in</b> their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work.
<br>   Soon they were leading their ponies <b>in</b> single file over <b>the</b> rim <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> long northward slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, down <b>into</b> a foggy sea. As they went down <b>the</b> mist became colder <b>and</b> damper, <b>and</b> their hair hung lank <b>and</b> dripping <b>on</b> their foreheads. When they reached <b>the</b> bottom <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so cold that they halted <b>and</b> got out cloaks <b>and</b> hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly <b>on</b> again, feeling their way <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rise <b>and</b> fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess, for <b>the</b> gate-like opening at <b>the</b> far northward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long valley which they <b>had</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Once they were through <b>the</b> gap, they <b>had</b> only lo keep <b>on</b> <b>in</b> anything like a straight line <b>and</b> they were bound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond <b>the</b> Downs there might be <b>no</b> fog.
<br>   Their going <b>was</b> <b>very</b> slow. To prevent their getting separated <b>and</b> wandering <b>in</b> different directions they went <b>in</b> file, with Frodo leading. Sam <b>was</b> behind him, <b>and</b> after him came Pippin, <b>and</b> then Merry. The valley seemed <b>to</b> stretch <b>on</b> endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began <b>to</b> loom through <b>the</b> mist; <b>and</b> he guessed that they were at last approaching <b>the</b> gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills, <b>the</b> north-gate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.
<br>   “Come <b>on</b>! Follow me!” he called back over his shoulder, <b>and</b> he hurried forward. But his hope soon changed <b>to</b> bewilderment <b>and</b> alarm. The dark patches grew darker, <b>but</b> they shrank; <b>and</b> suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him <b>and</b> leaning slightly towards one another like <b>the</b> pillars <b>of</b> a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember <b>having</b> seen any sign <b>of</b> these <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley, when he looked out from <b>the</b> hill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. He <b>had</b> passed between them almost before he <b>was</b> aware: <b>and</b> even as he did so darkness seemed <b>to</b> fall round him. His pony reared <b>and</b> snorted, <b>and</b> he fell off. When he looked back he found that he <b>was</b> alone: <b>the</b> others <b>had</b> not followed him. “Sam!” he called. “Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don't you keep up?”
<br>   There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> answer. Fear took him, <b>and</b> he ran back past <b>the</b> stones shouting wildly: “Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!” The pony bolted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist <b>and</b> vanished. From some way off, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> seemed, he <b>thought</b> he heard a cry: “Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!” It <b>was</b> away eastward, <b>on</b> his left as he stood under <b>the</b> great stones, staring <b>and</b> straining <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. He plunged off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> call, <b>and</b> found himself going steeply uphill.
<br>   As he struggled <b>on</b> he called again, <b>and</b> kept <b>on</b> calling more <b>and</b> more frantically; <b>but</b> he heard <b>no</b> answer for some time, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> seemed faint <b>and</b> far ahead <b>and</b> high above him. “Frodo! Hoy!” came <b>the</b> thin voices out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mist: <b>and</b> then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated, ending with a last help! that trailed off <b>into</b> a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all <b>the</b> speed he could towards <b>the</b> cries; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> light <b>was</b> now gone, <b>and</b> clinging night <b>had</b> closed about him, so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible <b>to</b> be sure <b>of</b> any direction. He seemed all <b>the</b> time <b>to</b> be climbing up <b>and</b> up.
<br>   Only <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground at his feet told him when he at last came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a ridge <b>or</b> hill. He <b>was</b> weary, sweating <b>and</b> yet chilled. It <b>was</b> wholly dark.
<br>   “Where are you?” he cried out miserably.
<br>   There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> reply. He stood listening. He <b>was</b> suddenly aware that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> getting <b>very</b> cold, <b>and</b> that up here a wind <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> blow, an icy wind. A change <b>was</b> coming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> weather. The mist <b>was</b> flowing past him now <b>in</b> shreds <b>and</b> tatters. His breath <b>was</b> smoking, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> darkness <b>was</b> less near <b>and</b> thick. He looked up <b>and</b> saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing overhead amid <b>the</b> strands <b>of</b> hurrying cloud <b>and</b> fog. The wind began <b>to</b> hiss over <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, <b>and</b> he made towards <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> even as he went forward <b>the</b> mist <b>was</b> rolled up <b>and</b> thrust aside, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> starry sky <b>was</b> unveiled. A glance showed him that he <b>was</b> now facing southwards <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from <b>the</b> north. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> biting wind <b>was</b> blowing. To his right there loomed against <b>the</b> westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.
<br>   “Where are you?” he cried again, both angry <b>and</b> afraid.
<br>   “Here!” said a voice, deep <b>and</b> cold, that seemed <b>to</b> come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground. “<b>I</b> am waiting for you!”
<br>   “No!” said Frodo; <b>but</b> he did not run away. His knees gave, <b>and</b> he fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Nothing happened, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound. Trembling he looked up, <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> see a tall dark figure like a shadow against <b>the</b> stars. It leaned over him. He <b>thought</b> there were two eyes, <b>very</b> cold though lit with a pale light that seemed <b>to</b> come from some remote distance. Then a grip stronger <b>and</b> colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, <b>and</b> he remembered <b>no</b> more.
<br>   When he came <b>to</b> himself again, for a moment he could recall <b>nothing</b> except a sense <b>of</b> dread. Then suddenly he knew that he <b>was</b> imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a barrow. A Barrow-wight <b>had</b> taken him, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> probably already under <b>the</b> dreadful spells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, <b>but</b> lay as he found himself: flat <b>on</b> his back upon a cold stone with his hands <b>on</b> his breast.
<br>   But though his fear <b>was</b> so great that <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> darkness that <b>was</b> round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins <b>and</b> his stories, <b>of</b> their jogging along together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lanes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> talking about roads <b>and</b> adventures. There <b>is</b> a seed <b>of</b> courage hidden (often deeply, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fattest <b>and</b> most timid hobbit, wailing for some final <b>and</b> desperate danger <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> grow. Frodo <b>was</b> neither <b>very</b> fat nor <b>very</b> timid; indeed, though he did not know <b>it</b>, Bilbo (<b>and</b> Gandalf) <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> him <b>the</b> best hobbit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. He <b>thought</b> he <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his adventure, <b>and</b> a terrible end, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he <b>no</b> longer felt limp like a helpless prey.
<br>   As he lay there, thinking <b>and</b> getting a hold <b>of</b> himself, he noticed all at <b>once</b> that <b>the</b> darkness <b>was</b> slowly giving way: a pale greenish light <b>was</b> growing round him. It did not at first show him <b>what</b> kind <b>of</b> a place he <b>was</b> <b>in</b>, for <b>the</b> light seemed <b>to</b> be coming out <b>of</b> himself, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> floor beside him, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> not yet reached <b>the</b> roof <b>or</b> wall. He turned, <b>and</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, <b>and</b> Merry. They were <b>on</b> their backs, <b>and</b> their faces looked deathly pale; <b>and</b> they were clad <b>in</b> white. About them lay many treasures, <b>of</b> gold maybe, though <b>in</b> that light they looked cold <b>and</b> unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their fingers were many rings. Swords lay <b>by</b> their sides, <b>and</b> shields were at their feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.
<br>   Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising <b>and</b> falling. The voice seemed far away <b>and</b> immeasurably dreary, sometimes high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>and</b> thin, sometimes like a low moan from <b>the</b> ground. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formless stream <b>of</b> sad <b>but</b> horrible sounds, strings <b>of</b> words would now <b>and</b> again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless <b>and</b> miserable. The night <b>was</b> railing against <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bereaved, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cold <b>was</b> cursing <b>the</b> warmth for which <b>it</b> hungered. Frodo <b>was</b> chilled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> marrow. After a while <b>the</b> song became clearer, <b>and</b> with dread <b>in</b> his heart he perceived that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> changed <b>into</b> an incantation:
<br>   
<br>Cold be hand <b>and</b> heart <b>and</b> bone,
<br><b>and</b> cold be sleep under stone:
<br>never mare <b>to</b> wake <b>on</b> stony bed,
<br>never, till <b>the</b> Sun fails <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Moon <b>is</b> dead.
<br>In <b>the</b> black wind <b>the</b> stars shall die,
<br><b>and</b> still <b>on</b> gold here let them lie,
<br>till <b>the</b> dark lord lifts his hand
<br>over dead sea <b>and</b> withered land.
<br>   
<br>   He heard behind his head a creaking <b>and</b> scraping sound. Raising himself <b>on</b> one arm he looked, <b>and</b> saw now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pale light that they were <b>in</b> a kind <b>of</b> passage which behind them turned a corner. Round <b>the</b> corner a long arm <b>was</b> groping, walking <b>on</b> its fingers towards Sam, who <b>was</b> lying nearest, <b>and</b> towards <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword that lay upon him.
<br>   At first Frodo felt as if he <b>had</b> indeed been turned <b>into</b> stone <b>by</b> <b>the</b> incantation. Then a wild <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> escape came <b>to</b> him. He wondered if he put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring, whether <b>the</b> Barrow-wight would miss him, <b>and</b> he might find some way out. He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself running free over <b>the</b> grass, grieving for Merry, <b>and</b> Sam, <b>and</b> Pippin, <b>but</b> free <b>and</b> alive himself. Gandalf would admit that there <b>had</b> been <b>nothing</b> else he could <b>do</b>.
<br>   But <b>the</b> courage that <b>had</b> been awakened <b>in</b> him <b>was</b> now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping <b>in</b> his pocket, <b>and</b> then fought with himself again; <b>and</b> as he did so <b>the</b> arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened <b>in</b> him, <b>and</b> he seized a short sword that lay beside him, <b>and</b> kneeling he stooped low over <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> his companions. With <b>what</b> strength he <b>had</b> he hewed at <b>the</b> crawling arm near <b>the</b> wrist, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand broke off; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> same moment <b>the</b> sword splintered up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hilt. There <b>was</b> a shriek <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light vanished. In <b>the</b> dark there <b>was</b> a snarling noise.
<br>   Frodo fell forward over Merry, <b>and</b> Merry's face felt cold. All at <b>once</b> back <b>into</b> his mind, from which <b>it</b> <b>had</b> disappeared with <b>the</b> first coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fog, came <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house down under <b>the</b> Hill, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Tom singing. He remembered <b>the</b> rhyme that Tom <b>had</b> taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! <b>and</b> with that name his voice seemed <b>to</b> grow strong: <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a full <b>and</b> lively sound, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dark chamber echoed as if <b>to</b> drum <b>and</b> trumpet.
<br>   
<br>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!
<br>By water, wood <b>and</b> hill, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> reed <b>and</b> willow,
<br>By fire, sun <b>and</b> moon, harken now <b>and</b> hear us!
<br>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need <b>is</b> near us!
<br>   
<br>   There <b>was</b> a sudden deep silence, <b>in</b> which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, <b>but</b> far away, as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> coming down through <b>the</b> ground <b>or</b> through thick walls, an answering voice singing:
<br>   
<br>Old Tom Bombadil <b>is</b> a merry fellow,
<br>Bright blue his jacket <b>is</b>, <b>and</b> his boots are yellow.
<br>None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> master:
<br>His songs are stronger songs, <b>and</b> his feet are faster.
<br>   
<br>   There <b>was</b> a loud rumbling sound, as <b>of</b> stones rolling <b>and</b> falling, <b>and</b> suddenly light streamed <b>in</b>, real light, <b>the</b> plain light <b>of</b> day. A low door-like opening appeared at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber beyond Frodo's feet; <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> Tom's head (hat, feather, <b>and</b> all) framed against <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sickly hue <b>had</b> left them. They looked now as if they were only <b>very</b> deeply asleep.
<br>   Tom stooped, removed his hat, <b>and</b> came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark chamber, singing:
<br>   
<br>Get out, you old Wight! Vanish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight!
<br>Shrivel like <b>the</b> cold mist, like <b>the</b> winds go wailing,
<br>Out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> barren lands far beyond <b>the</b> mountains!
<br>Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!
<br>Lost <b>and</b> forgotten be, darker than <b>the</b> darkness,
<br>Where gates stand for ever shut, till <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> mended.
<br>   
<br>   At these words there <b>was</b> a cry <b>and</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber fell <b>in</b> with a crash. Then there <b>was</b> a long trailing shriek, fading away <b>into</b> an unguessable distance; <b>and</b> after that silence.
<br>   “Come, friend Frodo!” said Tom. “Let us <b>get</b> out <b>on</b> <b>to</b> clean grass! You must help me bear them.”
<br>   Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam. As Frodo left <b>the</b> barrow for <b>the</b> last time he <b>thought</b> he saw a severed hand wriggling still, like a wounded spider, <b>in</b> a heap <b>of</b> fallen earth. Tom went back <b>in</b> again, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a sound <b>of</b> much thumping <b>and</b> stamping. When he came out he <b>was</b> bearing <b>in</b> his arms a great load <b>of</b> treasure: things <b>of</b> gold, silver, copper, <b>and</b> bronze; many beads <b>and</b> chains <b>and</b> jewelled ornaments. He climbed <b>the</b> green barrow <b>and</b> laid them all <b>on</b> top <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunshine.
<br>   There he stood, with his hat <b>in</b> his hand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> his hair, <b>and</b> looked down upon <b>the</b> three hobbits, that <b>had</b> been laid <b>on</b> their backs upon <b>the</b> grass at <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound. Raising his right hand he said <b>in</b> a clear <b>and</b> commanding voice:
<br>   
<br>Wake now my merry tads! Wake <b>and</b> hear me calling!
<br>Warm now be heart <b>and</b> limb! The cold stone <b>is</b> fallen;
<br>Dark door <b>is</b> standing wide; dead hand <b>is</b> broken.
<br>Night under Night <b>is</b> flown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gate <b>is</b> open!
<br>   
<br>   To Frodo's great joy <b>the</b> hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, <b>and</b> then suddenly sprang up. They looked about <b>in</b> amazement, first at Frodo, <b>and</b> then at Tom standing large as life <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barrow-top above them; <b>and</b> then at themselves <b>in</b> their thin white rags, crowned <b>and</b> belted with pale gold, <b>and</b> jingling with trinkets.
<br>   “What <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> wonder?” began Merry, feeling <b>the</b> golden circlet that <b>had</b> slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, <b>and</b> a shadow came over his face, <b>and</b> he closed his eyes. “Of course, <b>I</b> remember!” he said. “The men <b>of</b> Carn D?m came <b>on</b> us at night, <b>and</b> we were worsted. Ah! <b>the</b> spear <b>in</b> my heart!” He clutched at his breast. “No! No!” he said, opening his eyes. “What am <b>I</b> saying? <b>I</b> have been dreaming. Where did you <b>get</b> <b>to</b>, Frodo?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lost,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Let us think <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we are <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now! Let us go <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “Dressed up like this, sir?” said Sam. “Where are my clothes?” He flung his circlet, belt, <b>and</b> rings <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> looked round helplessly, as if he expected <b>to</b> find his cloak, jacket, <b>and</b> breeches, <b>and</b> other hobbit-garments lying somewhere <b>to</b> hand.
<br>   “You won't find your clothes again,” said Tom, bounding down from <b>the</b> mound, <b>and</b> laughing as he danced round them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. One would have <b>thought</b> that <b>nothing</b> dangerous <b>or</b> dreadful <b>had</b> happened; <b>and</b> indeed <b>the</b> horror faded out <b>of</b> their hearts as they looked at him, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> merry glint <b>in</b> his eyes.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled <b>and</b> half amused. “Why not?”
<br>   But Tom shook his head, saying: “You've found yourselves again, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep water. Clothes are <b>but</b> little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my merry friends, <b>and</b> let <b>the</b> warm sunlight heal now heart <b>and</b> limb! Cast off these cold rags! Run naked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!”
<br>   He sprang away down hill, whistling <b>and</b> calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along <b>the</b> green hollow between their hill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next, still whistling <b>and</b> crying:
<br>   
<br>Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither <b>do</b> you wander?
<br>Up, down, near <b>or</b> far, here, there <b>or</b> yonder?
<br>Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail <b>and</b> Bumpkin,
<br>White-socks my little lad, <b>and</b> old Fatty Lumpkin!
<br>   
<br>   So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat <b>and</b> catching <b>it</b>, until he <b>was</b> hidden <b>by</b> a fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground: <b>but</b> for some time his hey now! hoy now! came floating back down <b>the</b> wind, which <b>had</b> shifted round towards <b>the</b> south.
<br>   The air <b>was</b> growing <b>very</b> warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun with <b>the</b> delight <b>of</b> those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter <b>to</b> a friendly clime, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> people that, after being long ill <b>and</b> bedridden, wake one day <b>to</b> find that they are unexpectedly well <b>and</b> <b>the</b> day <b>is</b> again full <b>of</b> promise.
<br>   By <b>the</b> time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (<b>and</b> hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over <b>the</b> brow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> behind him came <b>in</b> an obedient line six ponies: their own five <b>and</b> one more. The last <b>was</b> plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he <b>was</b> larger, stronger, fatter (<b>and</b> older) than their own ponies. Merry, <b>to</b> whom <b>the</b> others belonged, <b>had</b> not, <b>in</b> fact, given them any such names, <b>but</b> they answered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new names that Tom <b>had</b> given them for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> their lives. Tom called them one <b>by</b> one <b>and</b> they climbed over <b>the</b> brow <b>and</b> stood <b>in</b> a line. Then Tom bowed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Here are your ponies, now!” he said. “They've more sense (<b>in</b> some ways) than you wandering hobbits have—more sense <b>in</b> their noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right <b>into</b>; <b>and</b> if they run <b>to</b> save themselves, then they run <b>the</b> right way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, <b>to</b> face fear <b>of</b> Barrow-wights <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!”
<br>   Merry, Sam, <b>and</b> Pippin now clothed themselves <b>in</b> spare garments from their packs; <b>and</b> they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged <b>to</b> put <b>on</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thicker <b>and</b> warmer things that they <b>had</b> brought against <b>the</b> oncoming <b>of</b> winter.
<br>   “Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “He's mine,” said Tom. “My four-legged friend; though <b>I</b> seldom ride him, <b>and</b> he wanders often far, free upon <b>the</b> hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got <b>to</b> know my Lumpkin; <b>and</b> they smelt him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> quickly ran <b>to</b> meet him. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he'd look for them <b>and</b> with his words <b>of</b> wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom's going <b>to</b> ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just <b>to</b> set you <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk <b>to</b> hobbits that are riding, when you're <b>on</b> your own legs trying <b>to</b> trot beside them.”
<br>   The hobbits were delighted <b>to</b> hear this, <b>and</b> thanked Tom many times; <b>but</b> he laughed, <b>and</b> said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he <b>had</b> seen them safe over <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> his land. “<b>I</b>'ve got things <b>to</b> <b>do</b>,” he said: “my making <b>and</b> my singing, my talking <b>and</b> my walking, <b>and</b> my watching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. Tom can't be always near <b>to</b> open doors <b>and</b> willow-cracks. Tom has his house <b>to</b> mind, <b>and</b> Goldberry <b>is</b> waiting.”
<br>   It <b>was</b> still fairly early <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun, something between nine <b>and</b> ten, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits turned their minds <b>to</b> food. Their last meal <b>had</b> been lunch beside <b>the</b> standing stone <b>the</b> day before. They breakfasted now off <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom <b>had</b> brought with him. It <b>was</b> not a large meal (considering hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> circumstances), <b>but</b> they felt much better for <b>it</b>. While they were eating Tom went up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mound, <b>and</b> looked through <b>the</b> treasures. Most <b>of</b> these he made <b>into</b> a pile that glistened <b>and</b> sparkled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass. He bade them lie there “free <b>to</b> all finders, birds, beasts. Elves <b>or</b> Men, <b>and</b> all kindly creatures”; for so <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound should be broken <b>and</b> scattered <b>and</b> <b>no</b> Wight ever come back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. He chose for himself from <b>the</b> pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers <b>or</b> <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> blue butterflies. He looked long at <b>it</b>, as if stirred <b>by</b> some memory, shaking his head, <b>and</b> saying at last:
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> a pretty toy for Tom <b>and</b> for his lady! Fair <b>was</b> <b>she</b> who long ago wore this <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Goldberry shall wear <b>it</b> now, <b>and</b> we will not forget <b>her</b>!”
<br>   For each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, <b>and</b> keen, <b>of</b> marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms <b>in</b> red <b>and</b> gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought <b>of</b> some strange metal, light <b>and</b> strong, <b>and</b> set with many fiery stones. Whether <b>by</b> some virtue <b>in</b> these sheaths <b>or</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spell that lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mound, <b>the</b> blades seemed untouched <b>by</b> time, unrusted, sharp, glittering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun.
<br>   “Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,” he said. “Sharp blades are good <b>to</b> have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, <b>or</b> far away <b>into</b> dark <b>and</b> danger.” Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago <b>by</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse: they were foes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>but</b> they were overcome <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evil king <b>of</b> Carn D?m <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Angmar.
<br>   “Few now remember them,” Tom murmured, “yet still some go wandering, sons <b>of</b> forgotten kings walking <b>in</b> loneliness, guarding from evil things folk that are heedless.”
<br>   The hobbits did not understand his words, <b>but</b> as he spoke they <b>had</b> a vision as <b>it</b> were <b>of</b> a great expanse <b>of</b> years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes <b>of</b> Men, tall <b>and</b> grim with bright swords, <b>and</b> last came one with a star <b>on</b> his brow. Then <b>the</b> vision faded, <b>and</b> they were back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlit world. It <b>was</b> time <b>to</b> start again. They made ready, packing their bags <b>and</b> lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung <b>on</b> their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them <b>very</b> awkward, <b>and</b> wondering if they would be <b>of</b> any <b>use</b>. Fighting <b>had</b> not before occurred <b>to</b> any <b>of</b> them as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adventures <b>in</b> which their flight would land them.
<br>   At last they set off. They led their ponies down <b>the</b> hill; <b>and</b> then mounting they trotted quickly along <b>the</b> valley. They looked back <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old mound <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> from <b>it</b> <b>the</b> sunlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downs <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hidden from view.
<br>   Though Frodo looked about him <b>on</b> every side he saw <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great stones standing like a gate, <b>and</b> before long they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern gap <b>and</b> rode swiftly through, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land fell away before them. It <b>was</b> a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, <b>or</b> before them, <b>on</b> Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> chiefly nonsense, <b>or</b> else perhaps a strange language unknown <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those <b>of</b> wonder <b>and</b> delight.
<br>   They went forward steadily, <b>but</b> they soon saw that <b>the</b> Road <b>was</b> further away than they <b>had</b> imagined. Even <b>without</b> a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching <b>it</b> until after nightfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day before. The dark line they <b>had</b> seen <b>was</b> not a line <b>of</b> trees <b>but</b> a line <b>of</b> bushes growing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a deep dike with a steep wall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> further side. Tom said that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> a kingdom, <b>but</b> a <b>very</b> long lime ago. He seemed <b>to</b> remember something sad about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> would not say much.
<br>   They climbed down <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dike <b>and</b> through a gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> then Tom turned due north, for they <b>had</b> been bearing somewhat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. The land <b>was</b> now open <b>and</b> fairly level, <b>and</b> they quickened their pace, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> already sinking low when at last they saw a line <b>of</b> tall trees ahead, <b>and</b> they knew that they <b>had</b> come back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road after many unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over <b>the</b> last furlongs, <b>and</b> halted under <b>the</b> long shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. They were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a sloping <b>bank</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Road, now dim as evening drew <b>on</b>, wound away below them. At this point <b>it</b> ran nearly from South-west <b>to</b> North-east, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their right <b>it</b> fell quickly down <b>into</b> a wide hollow. It <b>was</b> rutted <b>and</b> bore many signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent heavy rain; there were pools <b>and</b> pot-holes full <b>of</b> water. They rode down <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> looked up <b>and</b> down. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be seen. “Well, here we are again at last!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> suppose we haven't lost more than two days <b>by</b> my short cut through <b>the</b> Forest! But perhaps <b>the</b> delay will prove useful—<b>it</b> may have put them off our trail.”
<br>   The others looked at him. The shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they <b>had</b> entered <b>the</b> Forest they <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> chiefly <b>of</b> getting back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road; only now when <b>it</b> lay beneath their feet did they remember <b>the</b> danger which pursued them, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> more than likely <b>to</b> be lying <b>in</b> wait for them upon <b>the</b> Road itself. They looked anxiously back towards <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Road <b>was</b> brown <b>and</b> empty.
<br>   “Do you think,” asked Pippin hesitatingly, “<b>do</b> you think we may be pursued, tonight?”
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> hope not tonight,” answered Tom Bombadil; “nor perhaps <b>the</b> next day. But <b>do</b> not trust my guess; for <b>I</b> cannot tell for certain. Out east my knowledge fails. Tom <b>is</b> not master <b>of</b> Riders from <b>the</b> Black Land far beyond his country.”
<br>   All <b>the</b> same <b>the</b> hobbits wished he <b>was</b> coming with them. They felt that he would know how <b>to</b> deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would soon now be going forward <b>into</b> lands wholly strange <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> beyond all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> most vague <b>and</b> distant legends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gathering twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness <b>and</b> sense <b>of</b> loss <b>was</b> <b>on</b> them. They stood silent, reluctant <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> final parting, <b>and</b> only slowly became aware that Tom <b>was</b> wishing them farewell, <b>and</b> telling them <b>to</b> have good heart <b>and</b> <b>to</b> ride <b>on</b> till dark <b>without</b> halting.
<br>   “Tom will give you good advice, till this day <b>is</b> over (after that your own luck must go with you <b>and</b> guide you): four miles along <b>the</b> Road you'll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. There you'll find an old inn that <b>is</b> called The Prancing Pony. Barliman Butterbur <b>is</b> <b>the</b> worthy keeper. There you can stay <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> afterwards <b>the</b> morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, <b>but</b> wary! Keep up your merry hearts, <b>and</b> ride <b>to</b> meet your fortune!”
<br>   They begged him <b>to</b> come at least as far as <b>the</b> inn <b>and</b> drink <b>once</b> more with them; <b>but</b> he laughed <b>and</b> refused, saying:
<br>   Tom's country ends here: he will not pass <b>the</b> borders.
<br>Tom has his house <b>to</b> mind, <b>and</b> Goldberry <b>is</b> waiting!
<br>   Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped <b>on</b> Lumpkin's back, <b>and</b> rode up over <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> away singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   The hobbits climbed up <b>and</b> watched him until he <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> sight.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sorry <b>to</b> take leave <b>of</b> Master Bombadil,” said Sam. “He's a caution <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake. <b>I</b> reckon we may go a good deal further <b>and</b> see naught better, nor queerer. But <b>I</b> won't deny <b>I</b>'ll be glad <b>to</b> see this Prancing Pony he spoke <b>of</b>. <b>I</b> hope <b>it</b>'ll be like The Green Dragon away back home! What sort <b>of</b> folk are they <b>in</b> Bree?”
<br>   “There are hobbits <b>in</b> Bree,” said Merry, “as well as Big Folk. <b>I</b> daresay <b>it</b> will be homelike enough. The Pony <b>is</b> a good inn <b>by</b> all accounts. My people ride out there now <b>and</b> again.”
<br>   “It may be all we could wish,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> outside <b>the</b> Shire all <b>the</b> same. Don't make yourselves too much at home! Please remember -all <b>of</b> you—that <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins must not be mentioned. <b>I</b> am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.”
<br>   They now mounted their ponies <b>and</b> rode off silently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> evening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill <b>and</b> up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.
<br>   Before them rose Bree-hill barring <b>the</b> way, a dark mass against misty stars; <b>and</b> under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards <b>it</b> they now hurried desiring only <b>to</b> find a fire, <b>and</b> a door between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 9
<br>AT <b>THE</b> SIGN OF <b>THE</b> PRANCING PONY
<br>   
<br>   Bree <b>was</b> <b>the</b> chief village <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, a small inhabited region, like an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there <b>was</b> Staddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, Combe <b>in</b> a deep valley a little further eastward, <b>and</b> Archet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill <b>and</b> <b>the</b> villages <b>was</b> a small country <b>of</b> fields <b>and</b> tamed woodland only a few miles broad.
<br>   The Men <b>of</b> Bree were brown-haired, broad, <b>and</b> rather short, cheerful <b>and</b> independent: they belonged <b>to</b> nobody <b>but</b> themselves; <b>but</b> they were more friendly <b>and</b> familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, <b>and</b> other inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world about them than <b>was</b> (<b>or</b> <b>is</b>) usual with Big People. According <b>to</b> their own tales they were <b>the</b> original inhabitants <b>and</b> were <b>the</b> descendants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Men that ever wandered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle-world. Few <b>had</b> survived <b>the</b> turmoils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days; <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Kings returned again over <b>the</b> Great Sea they <b>had</b> found <b>the</b> Bree-men still there, <b>and</b> they were still there now, when <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Kings <b>had</b> faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   In those days <b>no</b> other Men <b>had</b> settled dwellings so far west, <b>or</b> within a hundred leagues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, <b>and</b> knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> their origin. They were taller <b>and</b> darker than <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Bree <b>and</b> were believed <b>to</b> have strange powers <b>of</b> sight <b>and</b> hearing, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> beasts <b>and</b> birds. They roamed at will southwards, <b>and</b> eastwards even as far as <b>the</b> Misty Mountains; <b>but</b> they were now few <b>and</b> rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from afar, <b>and</b> told strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened <b>to</b>; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk did not make friends <b>of</b> them.
<br>   There were also many families <b>of</b> hobbits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land <b>and</b> they claimed <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> oldest settlement <b>of</b> Hobbits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, one that <b>was</b> founded long before even <b>the</b> Brandywine <b>was</b> crossed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire colonized. They lived mostly <b>in</b> Staddle though there were some <b>in</b> Bree itself, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, above <b>the</b> houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men. The Big Folk <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Little Folk (as they called one another) were <b>on</b> friendly terms, minding their own affairs <b>in</b> their own ways, <b>but</b> both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk. Nowhere else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> this peculiar (<b>but</b> excellent) arrangement <b>to</b> be found.
<br>   The Bree-folk, Big <b>and</b> Little, did not themselves travel much; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> affairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> Bree went as far as Buckland, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing; <b>but</b> though their link land <b>was</b> not much further than a day's riding east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine Bridge, <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire now seldom visited <b>it</b>. An occasional Bucklander <b>or</b> adventurous Took would come out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Inn for a night <b>or</b> two, <b>but</b> even that <b>was</b> becoming less <b>and</b> less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred <b>to</b> those <b>of</b> Bree, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> any others that lived beyond <b>the</b> borders, as Outsiders, <b>and</b> took <b>very</b> little interest <b>in</b> them, considering them dull <b>and</b> uncouth. There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World <b>in</b> those days than <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were <b>no</b> better than tramps, ready <b>to</b> dig a hole <b>in</b> any <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> stay only as long as <b>it</b> suited them. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, at any rate, <b>the</b> hobbits were decent <b>and</b> prosperous, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> more rustic than most <b>of</b> their distant relatives Inside. It <b>was</b> not yet forgotten that there <b>had</b> been a time when there <b>was</b> much coming <b>and</b> going between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree. There <b>was</b> Bree-blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brandybucks <b>by</b> all accounts.
<br>   The village <b>of</b> Bree <b>had</b> some hundred stone houses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Folk, mostly above <b>the</b> Road, nestling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillside with windows looking west. On that side, running <b>in</b> more than half a circle from <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> back <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, there <b>was</b> a deep dike with a thick hedge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inner side. Over this <b>the</b> Road crossed <b>by</b> a causeway; <b>but</b> where <b>it</b> pierced <b>the</b> hedge <b>it</b> <b>was</b> barred <b>by</b> a great gate. There <b>was</b> another gate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern comer where <b>the</b> Road ran out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village. The gates were closed at nightfall; <b>but</b> just inside them were small lodges for <b>the</b> gatekeepers.
<br>   Down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, where <b>it</b> swept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right <b>to</b> go round <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, there <b>was</b> a large inn. It <b>had</b> been built long ago when <b>the</b> traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads <b>had</b> been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting <b>of</b> ways; another ancient road crossed <b>the</b> East Road just outside (he dike at <b>the</b> western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> former days Men <b>and</b> other folk <b>of</b> various sorts <b>had</b> travelled much <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Strange as News from Bree <b>was</b> still a saying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, <b>and</b> East could be heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inn, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> Shire-hobbits used <b>to</b> go more often <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b>. But <b>the</b> Northern Lands <b>had</b> long been desolate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North Road <b>was</b> now seldom used: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> grass-grown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk called <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Greenway.
<br>   The Inn <b>of</b> Bree <b>was</b> still there, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper <b>was</b> an important person. His house <b>was</b> a meeting place for <b>the</b> idle, talkative, <b>and</b> inquisitive among <b>the</b> inhabitants, large <b>and</b> small, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four villages; <b>and</b> a resort <b>of</b> Rangers <b>and</b> other wanderers, <b>and</b> for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East Road, <b>to</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> Mountains.
<br>   It <b>was</b> dark, <b>and</b> white stars were shining, when Frodo <b>and</b> his companions came at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greenway-crossing <b>and</b> drew near <b>the</b> village. They came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West-gate <b>and</b> found <b>it</b> shut, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lodge beyond <b>it</b>, there <b>was</b> a man <b>sitting</b>. He jumped up <b>and</b> fetched a lantern <b>and</b> looked over <b>the</b> gate at them <b>in</b> surprise.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you want, <b>and</b> where <b>do</b> you come from?” he asked gruffly.
<br>   “We are making for <b>the</b> inn here,” answered Frodo. “We are journeying east <b>and</b> cannot go further tonight.”
<br>   “Hobbits! Four hobbits! And <b>what</b>'s more, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>by</b> their talk,” said <b>the</b> gatekeeper, softly as if speaking <b>to</b> himself. He stared at them darkly for a moment, <b>and</b> then slowly opened <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> let them ride through.
<br>   “We don't often see Shire-folk riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road at night,” he went <b>on</b>, as they halted a moment <b>by</b> his door. “You'll pardon my wondering <b>what</b> business takes you away east <b>of</b> Bree! What may your names be, might <b>I</b> ask?”
<br>   “Our names <b>and</b> our business are our own, <b>and</b> this does not seem a good place <b>to</b> discuss them,” said Frodo, not liking <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man <b>or</b> <b>the</b> tone <b>of</b> his voice.
<br>   “Your business <b>is</b> your own, <b>no</b> doubt,” said <b>the</b> man; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s my business <b>to</b> ask questions after nightfall.”
<br>   “We are hobbits from Buckland, <b>and</b> we have a fancy <b>to</b> travel <b>and</b> <b>to</b> stay at <b>the</b> inn here,” put <b>in</b> Merry. “<b>I</b> am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used <b>to</b> be fair-spoken <b>to</b> travellers, <b>or</b> so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard.”
<br>   “All right, all right!” said <b>the</b> man. “<b>I</b> meant <b>no</b> offence. But you'll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at <b>the</b> gate will be asking you questions. There's queer folk about. If you go <b>on</b> <b>to</b> The Pony, you'll find you're oat <b>the</b> only guests.”
<br>   He wished them good night, <b>and</b> they said <b>no</b> more; <b>but</b> Frodo could see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lantern-light that <b>the</b> man <b>was</b> still eyeing them curiously. He <b>was</b> glad <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> gate clang <b>to</b> behind them, as they rode forward. He wondered why <b>the</b> man <b>was</b> so suspicious, <b>and</b> whether any one <b>had</b> been asking for news <b>of</b> a party <b>of</b> hobbits. Could <b>it</b> have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while they were delayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Downs. But there <b>was</b> something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> look <b>and</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gatekeeper that made him uneasy.
<br>   The man stared after <b>the</b> hobbits for a moment, <b>and</b> then he went back <b>to</b> his house. As soon as his back <b>was</b> turned, a dark figure climbed quickly <b>in</b> over <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> melted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village street.
<br>   The hobbits rode <b>on</b> up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, <b>and</b> drew up outside <b>the</b> inn. The houses looked large <b>and</b> strange <b>to</b> them. Sam stared up at <b>the</b> inn with its three storeys <b>and</b> many windows, <b>and</b> felt his heart sink. He <b>had</b> imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees, <b>and</b> other creatures even more terrifying, some time <b>or</b> other <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> his journey; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> moment he <b>was</b> finding his first sight <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for <b>the</b> dark end <b>of</b> a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inn-yard, <b>and</b> Black Riders peering out <b>of</b> dark upper windows.
<br>   “We surely aren't going <b>to</b> stay here for <b>the</b> night, are we, sir?” he exclaimed. “If there are hobbit-folk <b>in</b> these pans, why don't we look for some that would be willing <b>to</b> take us <b>in</b>? It would be more homelike.”
<br>   “What's wrong with <b>the</b> inn?” said Frodo. “Tom Bombadil recommended <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> expect <b>it</b>'s homelike enough inside.”
<br>   Even from <b>the</b> outside <b>the</b> inn looked a pleasant house <b>to</b> familiar eyes. It <b>had</b> a front <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> two wings running back <b>on</b> land partly cut out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, so that at <b>the</b> rear <b>the</b> second-floor windows were level with <b>the</b> ground. There <b>was</b> a wide arch leading <b>to</b> a courtyard between <b>the</b> two wings, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left under <b>the</b> arch there <b>was</b> a large doorway reached <b>by</b> a few broad steps. The door <b>was</b> open <b>and</b> light streamed out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Above <b>the</b> arch there <b>was</b> a lamp, <b>and</b> beneath <b>it</b> swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up <b>on</b> its hind legs. Over <b>the</b> door <b>was</b> painted <b>in</b> white letters: <b>the</b> prancing pony <b>by</b> barliman butterbur. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.
<br>   As they hesitated outside <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, <b>and</b> many cheerful voices joined loudly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chorus. They listened <b>to</b> this encouraging sound for a moment <b>and</b> then got off their ponies. The song ended <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a burst <b>of</b> laughter <b>and</b> clapping.
<br>   They led their ponies under <b>the</b> arch, <b>and</b> leaving them standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yard they climbed up <b>the</b> steps. Frodo went forward <b>and</b> nearly bumped <b>into</b> a short fat man with a bald head <b>and</b> a red face. He <b>had</b> a white apron <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> bustling out <b>of</b> one door <b>and</b> <b>in</b> through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.
<br>   “Can we—” began Frodo.
<br>   “Half a minute, if you please!” shouted <b>the</b> man over his shoulder, <b>and</b> vanished <b>into</b> a babel <b>of</b> voices <b>and</b> a cloud <b>of</b> smoke. In a moment he <b>was</b> out again, wiping his hands <b>on</b> his apron.
<br>   “Good evening, little master!” he said, bending down. “What may you be wanting?”
<br>   “Beds for four, <b>and</b> stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr. Butterbur?”
<br>   “That's right! Barliman <b>is</b> my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! You're from <b>the</b> Shire, eh?” he said, <b>and</b> then suddenly he clapped his hand <b>to</b> his forehead, as if trying <b>to</b> remember something. “Hobbits!” he cried. “Now <b>what</b> does that remind me <b>of</b>? Might <b>I</b> ask your names, sir?”
<br>   “Mr. Took <b>and</b> Mr. Brandybuck,” said Frodo; “<b>and</b> this <b>is</b> Sam Gamgee. My name <b>is</b> Underhill.”
<br>   “There now!” said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. “It's gone again! But <b>it</b>'ll come back, when <b>I</b> have time <b>to</b> think. <b>I</b>'m run off my feet; <b>but</b> <b>I</b>'ll see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> for you. We don't often <b>get</b> a party out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire nowadays, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should be sorry not <b>to</b> make you welcome. But there <b>is</b> such a crowd already <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house tonight as there hasn't been for long enough. It never rains <b>but</b> <b>it</b> pours, we say <b>in</b> Bree.
<br>   “Hi! Nob!” he shouted. “Where are you, you woolly-footed slow-coach? Nob!”
<br>   “Coming, sir! Coming!” A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out <b>of</b> a door, <b>and</b> seeing <b>the</b> travellers, stopped short <b>and</b> stared at them with great interest.
<br>   “Where's Bob?” asked <b>the</b> landlord. “You don't know? Well find him! Double sharp! <b>I</b> haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's five ponies that have <b>to</b> be stabled. He must find room somehow.” Nob trotted off with a grin <b>and</b> a wink.
<br>   “Well, now, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> going <b>to</b> say?” said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead. “One thing drives out another, so <b>to</b> speak. <b>I</b>'m that busy tonight, my head <b>is</b> going round. There's a party that came up <b>the</b> Greenway from down South last night—<b>and</b> that <b>was</b> strange enough <b>to</b> begin with. Then there's a travelling company <b>of</b> dwarves going West come <b>in</b> this evening. And now there's you. If you weren't hobbits, <b>I</b> doubt if we could house you. But we've got a room <b>or</b> two <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place <b>was</b> built. On <b>the</b> ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows <b>and</b> all as they like <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> hope you'll be comfortable. You'll be wanting supper, <b>I</b> don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!”
<br>   He led them a short way down a passage, <b>and</b> opened a door. “Here <b>is</b> a nice little parlour!” he said. “<b>I</b> hope <b>it</b> will suit. Excuse me now. <b>I</b>'m that busy. No time for talking. <b>I</b> must be trotting. It's hard work for two legs, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>get</b> thinner. <b>I</b>'ll look <b>in</b> again later. If you want anything, ring <b>the</b> hand-bell, <b>and</b> Nob will come. If he don't come, ring <b>and</b> shout!”
<br>   Off he went at last, <b>and</b> left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable <b>of</b> an endless stream <b>of</b> talk, however busy he might be. They found themselves <b>in</b> a small <b>and</b> cosy room. There <b>was</b> a bit <b>of</b> bright fire burning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> <b>it</b> were some low <b>and</b> comfortable chairs. There <b>was</b> a round table, already spread with a white cloth, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a large hand-bell. But Nob, <b>the</b> hobbit servant, came bustling <b>in</b> long before they <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> ringing. He brought candles <b>and</b> a tray full <b>of</b> plates.
<br>   “Will you be wanting anything <b>to</b> drink, masters?” he asked. “And shall <b>I</b> show you <b>the</b> bedrooms, while your supper <b>is</b> got ready?”
<br>   They were washed <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> good deep mugs <b>of</b> beer when Mr. Butterbur <b>and</b> Nob came <b>in</b> again. In a twinkling <b>the</b> table <b>was</b> laid. There <b>was</b> hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs <b>of</b> butter, <b>and</b> half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as <b>the</b> Shire could show, <b>and</b> homelike enough <b>to</b> dispel <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> Sam's misgivings (already much relieved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> excellence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beer).
<br>   The landlord hovered round for a link, <b>and</b> then prepared <b>to</b> leave them. “<b>I</b> don't know whether you would care <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company, when you have supped,” he said, standing at <b>the</b> door. “Perhaps you would rather go <b>to</b> your beds. Still <b>the</b> company would be <b>very</b> pleased <b>to</b> welcome you, if you <b>had</b> a mind. We don't <b>get</b> Outsiders—travellers from <b>the</b> Shire, <b>I</b> should say, begging your pardon—often; <b>and</b> we like <b>to</b> hear a bit <b>of</b> news, <b>or</b> any story <b>or</b> song you may have <b>in</b> mind. But as you please! Ring <b>the</b> bell, if you lack anything!”
<br>   So refreshed <b>and</b> encouraged did they feel at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> their supper (about three quarters <b>of</b> an hour's steady going, not hindered <b>by</b> unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam decided <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company. Merry said <b>it</b> would be too stuffy. “<b>I</b> shall sit here quietly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire for a bit, <b>and</b> perhaps go out later for a sniff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air. Mind your Ps <b>and</b> Qs, <b>and</b> don't forget that you are supposed <b>to</b> be escaping <b>in</b> secret, <b>and</b> are still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high-road <b>and</b> not <b>very</b> far from <b>the</b> Shire!”
<br>   “All right!” said Pippin. “Mind yourself! Don't <b>get</b> lost, <b>and</b> don't forget that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> safer indoors!”
<br>   The company <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big common-room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inn. The gathering <b>was</b> large <b>and</b> mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for <b>the</b> three lamps hanging from <b>the</b> beams were dim, <b>and</b> half veiled <b>in</b> smoke. Barliman Butterbur <b>was</b> standing near <b>the</b> fire, talking <b>to</b> a couple <b>of</b> dwarves <b>and</b> one <b>or</b> two strange-looking men. On <b>the</b> benches were various folk: men <b>of</b> Bree, a collection <b>of</b> local hobbits (<b>sitting</b> chattering together), a few more dwarves, <b>and</b> other vague figures difficult <b>to</b> make out away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>and</b> comers.
<br>   As soon as <b>the</b> Shire-hobbits entered, there <b>was</b> a chorus <b>of</b> welcome from <b>the</b> Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that <b>had</b> come up <b>the</b> Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced <b>the</b> newcomers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were seldom sure who <b>the</b> names belonged <b>to</b>. The Men <b>of</b> Bree seemed all <b>to</b> have rather botanical (<b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool <b>and</b> Ferny (not <b>to</b> mention Butterbur). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits <b>had</b> similar names. The Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous. But most <b>of</b> them <b>had</b> natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, <b>and</b> Tunnelly, many <b>of</b> which were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, <b>and</b> as they could not imagine sharing a name <b>without</b> being related, they took Frodo <b>to</b> their hearts as a long-lost cousin.
<br>   The Bree-hobbits were, <b>in</b> fact, friendly <b>and</b> inquisitive, <b>and</b> Frodo soon found that some explanation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he <b>was</b> doing would have <b>to</b> be given. He gave out that he <b>was</b> interested <b>in</b> history <b>and</b> geography (at which there <b>was</b> much wagging <b>of</b> heads, although neither <b>of</b> these words were much used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bree-dialect). He said he <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b> writing a <b>book</b> (at which there <b>was</b> silent astonishment), <b>and</b> that he <b>and</b> his friends wanted <b>to</b> collect information about hobbits living outside <b>the</b> Shire, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern lands.
<br>   At this a chorus <b>of</b> voices broke out. If Frodo <b>had</b> really wanted <b>to</b> write a <b>book</b>, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters <b>in</b> a few minutes. And if that <b>was</b> not enough, he <b>was</b> given a whole list <b>of</b> names, <b>beginning</b> with “Old Barliman here”, <b>to</b> whom he could go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign <b>of</b> writing a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, <b>the</b> hobbits returned <b>to</b> their questions about doings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Frodo did not prove <b>very</b> communicative, <b>and</b> he soon found himself <b>sitting</b> alone <b>in</b> a comer, listening <b>and</b> looking around.
<br>   The Men <b>and</b> Dwarves were mostly talking <b>of</b> distant events <b>and</b> telling flews <b>of</b> a kind that <b>was</b> becoming only too familiar. There <b>was</b> trouble away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> Men who <b>had</b> come up <b>the</b> Greenway were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The Bree-folk were sympathetic, <b>but</b> plainly not <b>very</b> ready <b>to</b> take a large number <b>of</b> strangers <b>into</b> their little land. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, <b>was</b> foretelling that more <b>and</b> more people would be coming north <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future. “If room isn't found for them, they'll find <b>it</b> for themselves. They've a right <b>to</b> live, same as other folk,” he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at <b>the</b> prospect.
<br>   The hobbits did not pay much attention <b>to</b> all this, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not at <b>the</b> moment seem <b>to</b> concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings <b>in</b> hobbit-holes. They were more interested <b>in</b> Sam <b>and</b> Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, <b>and</b> were chatting gaily about events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Pippin roused a good deal <b>of</b> laughter with an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Town Hole <b>in</b> Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, <b>the</b> Mayor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fattest hobbit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Westfarthing, <b>had</b> been buried <b>in</b> chalk, <b>and</b> came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-landers, who seemed <b>to</b> have been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire several times, wanted <b>to</b> know where <b>the</b> Underhills lived <b>and</b> who they were related <b>to</b>.
<br>   Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows near <b>the</b> wall, <b>was</b> also listening intently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbit-talk. He <b>had</b> a tall tankard <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots <b>of</b> supple leather that fitted him well, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> seen much wear <b>and</b> were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak <b>of</b> heavy dark-green cloth <b>was</b> drawn close about him, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> gleam <b>of</b> his eyes could be seen as he watched <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Who <b>is</b> that?” Frodo asked, when he got a chance <b>to</b> whisper <b>to</b> Mr. Butterbur. “<b>I</b> don't think you introduced him?”
<br>   “Him?” said <b>the</b> landlord <b>in</b> an answering whisper, cocking an eye <b>without</b> turning his head. “<b>I</b> don't rightly know. He <b>is</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wandering folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not <b>but</b> <b>what</b> he can tell a rare tale when he has <b>the</b> mind. He disappears for a month, <b>or</b> a year, <b>and</b> then he pops up again. He <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out pretty often last spring; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> haven't seen him about lately. What his right name <b>is</b> <b>I</b>'ve never heard: <b>but</b> he's known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace <b>on</b> his long shanks; though he don't tell nobody <b>what</b> cause he has <b>to</b> hurry. But there's <b>no</b> accounting for East <b>and</b> West, as we say <b>in</b> Bree, meaning <b>the</b> Rangers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.” But at that moment Mr. Butterbur <b>was</b> called away <b>by</b> a demand for more ale <b>and</b> his last remark remained unexplained.
<br>   Frodo found that Strider <b>was</b> now looking at him, as if he <b>had</b> heard <b>or</b> guessed all that <b>had</b> been said. Presently, with a wave <b>of</b> his hand <b>and</b> a nod, he invited Frodo <b>to</b> come over <b>and</b> sit <b>by</b> him. As Frodo drew near be threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head <b>of</b> dark hair necked with grey, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> a pale stem face a pair <b>of</b> keen grey eyes.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am called Strider,” he said <b>in</b> a low voice. “<b>I</b> am <b>very</b> pleased <b>to</b> meet you. Master—Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.”
<br>   “He did,” said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under <b>the</b> stare <b>of</b> those keen eyes.
<br>   “Well, Master Underhill,” said Strider, “if <b>I</b> were you, <b>I</b> should stop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, <b>and</b> chance-meeting are pleasant enough, <b>but</b>, well—this isn't <b>the</b> Shire. There are queer folk about. Though <b>I</b> say <b>it</b> as shouldn't, you may think,” he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo's glance. “And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree lately,” he went <b>on</b>, watching Frodo's face.
<br>   Frodo returned his gaze <b>but</b> said <b>nothing</b>; <b>and</b> Strider made <b>no</b> further sign. His attention seemed suddenly <b>to</b> be fixed <b>on</b> Pippin. To his alarm Frodo became aware that <b>the</b> ridiculous young Took, encouraged <b>by</b> his success with <b>the</b> fat Mayor <b>of</b> Michel Delving, <b>was</b> now actually giving a comic account <b>of</b> Bilbo's farewell party. He <b>was</b> already giving an imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Speech, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> astonishing Disappearance.
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> annoyed. It <b>was</b> a harmless enough tale for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local hobbits, <b>no</b> doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond <b>the</b> River; <b>but</b> some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins <b>to</b> their minds, especially if there <b>had</b> been inquiries <b>in</b> Bree after that name.
<br>   Frodo fidgeted, wondering <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>. Pippin <b>was</b> evidently much enjoying <b>the</b> attention he <b>was</b> getting, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> become quite forgetful <b>of</b> their danger. Frodo <b>had</b> a sudden fear that <b>in</b> his present mood he might even mention <b>the</b> Ring; <b>and</b> that might well be disastrous.
<br>   “You <b>had</b> better <b>do</b> something quick!” whispered Strider <b>in</b> his ear.
<br>   Frodo jumped up <b>and</b> stood <b>on</b> a table, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> talk. The attention <b>of</b> Pippin's audience <b>was</b> disturbed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits looked at Frodo <b>and</b> laughed <b>and</b> clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill <b>had</b> taken as much ale as <b>was</b> good for him.
<br>   Frodo suddenly felt <b>very</b> foolish, <b>and</b> found himself (as <b>was</b> his habit when making a speech) fingering <b>the</b> things <b>in</b> his pocket. He felt <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b> its chain, <b>and</b> quite unaccountably <b>the</b> desire came over him <b>to</b> slip <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> vanish out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silly situation. It seemed <b>to</b> him, somehow, as if me suggestion came <b>to</b> him from outside, from someone <b>or</b> something a <b>the</b> room. He resisted <b>the</b> temptation firmly, <b>and</b> clasped <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> his hand, as if <b>to</b> keep a hold <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> prevent <b>it</b> from escaping <b>or</b> doing any mischief. At any rate <b>it</b> gave him <b>no</b> inspiration. He spoke “a few suitable words”, as they would have said <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire: We are all <b>very</b> much gratified <b>by</b> <b>the</b> kindness <b>of</b> your reception, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> venture <b>to</b> hope that my brief visit will help <b>to</b> renew <b>the</b> old ties <b>of</b> friendship between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> Bree; <b>and</b> then he hesitated <b>and</b> coughed.
<br>   Everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room <b>was</b> now looking at him. “A song!” shouted one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “A song! A song!” shouted all <b>the</b> others. “Come <b>on</b> now, master, sing us something that we haven't heard before!”
<br>   For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then <b>in</b> desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo <b>had</b> been rather fond <b>of</b> (<b>and</b> indeed rather proud <b>of</b>, for he <b>had</b> made up <b>the</b> words himself). It <b>was</b> about an inn; <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> probably why <b>it</b> came <b>into</b> Frodo's mind just then. Here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> full. Only a few words <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are now, as a rule, remembered.
<br>   
<br>There <b>is</b> an inn, a merry old inn
<br>beneath an old grey hill,
<br>And there they brew a beer so brown
<br>That <b>the</b> Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moon himself came down
<br>one night <b>to</b> drink his fill.
<br>
<br>The ostler has a tipsy cat
<br>that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
<br>And up <b>and</b> down he runs his bow,
<br>Now squeaking high, now purring low,
<br>now sawing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle.
<br>
<br>The landlord keeps a little dog
<br>that <b>is</b> mighty fond <b>of</b> jokes;
<br>When there's good cheer among <b>the</b> guests,
<br>He cocks an ear at all <b>the</b> jests
<br><b>and</b> laughs until he chokes.
<br>
<br>They also keep a horned cow
<br>as proud as any queen;
<br>But music turns <b>her</b> head like ale,
<br>And makes <b>her</b> wave <b>her</b> tufted tail
<br><b>and</b> dance upon <b>the</b> green.
<br>
<br>And O! <b>the</b> rows <b>of</b> silver dishes
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> store <b>of</b> silver spoons!
<br>For Sunday* there's a special pair,
<br>And these they polish up with care
<br><b>on</b> Saturday afternoons.
<br>					
<br>The Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moon <b>was</b> drinking deep,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> cat began <b>to</b> wail;
<br>A dish <b>and</b> a spoon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table danced,
<br>The cow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden madly pranced,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> little dog chased his tail.
<br>
<br>The Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moon took another mug,
<br><b>and</b> then rolled beneath his chair;
<br>And there he dozed <b>and</b> dreamed <b>of</b> ale,
<br>Till <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>the</b> stars were pale,
<br><b>and</b> dawn <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air.
<br>
<br>Then <b>the</b> ostler said <b>to</b> his tipsy cat:
<br>“The white horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>They neigh <b>and</b> champ their silver bits;
<br>But their master's been <b>and</b> drowned his wits,
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun'll be rising soon!’
<br>
<br>So <b>the</b> cat <b>on</b> his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,
<br>a jig that would wake <b>the</b> dead:
<br>He squeaked <b>and</b> sawed <b>and</b> quickened <b>the</b> tune,
<br>While <b>the</b> landlord shook <b>the</b> Man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moon:
<br>“It's after three!” he said.
<br>
<br>They rolled <b>the</b> Man slowly up <b>the</b> hill
<br><b>and</b> bundled him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>While his horses galloped up <b>in</b> rear,
<br>And <b>the</b> cow came capering like a deer,
<br><b>and</b> a dish ran up with <b>the</b> spoon.
<br>
<br>Now quicker <b>the</b> fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
<br><b>the</b> dog began <b>to</b> roar,
<br>The cow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horses stood <b>on</b> their heads;
<br>The guests all bounded from their beds
<br><b>and</b> danced upon <b>the</b> floor.
<br>
<br>With a ping <b>and</b> a pong <b>the</b> fiddle-strings broke!
<br><b>the</b> cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon,
<br>And <b>the</b> little dog laughed <b>to</b> see such fun,
<br>And <b>the</b> Saturday dish went off at a run
<br>with <b>the</b> silver Sunday spoon.
<br>
<br>The round Moon rolled behind <b>the</b> hill
<br>as <b>the</b> Sun raised up <b>her</b> head.
<br>She** hardly believed <b>her</b> fiery eyes;
<br>For though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> day, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> surprise
<br>they all went back <b>to</b> bed!
<br>
<br>   There <b>was</b> loud <b>and</b> long applause. Frodo <b>had</b> a good voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song tickled their fancy. “Where's old Barley?” they cried. “He ought <b>to</b> hear this. Bob ought <b>to</b> learn his cat <b>the</b> fiddle, <b>and</b> then we'd have a dance.” They called for more ale, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> shout: “Let's have <b>it</b> again, master! Come <b>on</b> now! Once more!”
<br>   They made Frodo have another drink, <b>and</b> then begin his song again, while many <b>of</b> them joined <b>in</b>; for <b>the</b> tune <b>was</b> well known, <b>and</b> they were quick at picking up words. It <b>was</b> now Frodo's turn <b>to</b> feel pleased with himself. He capered about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table; <b>and</b> when he came a second time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon, he leaped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, <b>into</b> a tray full <b>of</b> mugs, <b>and</b> slipped, <b>and</b> rolled off <b>the</b> table with a crash, clatter, <b>and</b> bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, <b>and</b> stopped short a gaping silence; for <b>the</b> singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he <b>had</b> gone slap through <b>the</b> floor <b>without</b> leaving a hole!
<br>   The local hobbits stared <b>in</b> amazement, <b>and</b> then sprang <b>to</b> their feet <b>and</b> shouted for Barliman. All <b>the</b> company drew away from Pippin <b>and</b> Sam, who found themselves left alone <b>in</b> a comer, <b>and</b> eyed darkly <b>and</b> doubtfully from a distance. It <b>was</b> plain that many people regarded them now as <b>the</b> companions <b>of</b> a travelling magician <b>of</b> unknown powers <b>and</b> purpose. But there <b>was</b> one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing <b>and</b> half-mocking expression that made them feel <b>very</b> uncomfortable. Presently he slipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> squint-eyed southerner: <b>the</b> two <b>had</b> been whispering together a good deal during <b>the</b> evening. Harry <b>the</b> gatekeeper also went out just behind them..
<br>   Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing <b>what</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, he crawled away under <b>the</b> tables <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark comer <b>by</b> Strider, who sat unmoved, giving <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> took off <b>the</b> Ring. How <b>it</b> came <b>to</b> be <b>on</b> his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he <b>had</b> been handling <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his pocket while he sang, <b>and</b> that somehow <b>it</b> <b>had</b> slipped <b>on</b> when he stuck out his hand with a jerk <b>to</b> save his fall. For a moment he wondered if <b>the</b> Ring itself <b>had</b> not played him a trick; perhaps <b>it</b> <b>had</b> tried <b>to</b> reveal itself <b>in</b> response <b>to</b> some wish <b>or</b> command that <b>was</b> felt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room. He did not like <b>the</b> looks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men that <b>had</b> gone out.
<br>   “Well?” said Strider, when he reappeared. “Why did you <b>do</b> that? Worse than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot <b>in</b> <b>it</b>! Or should <b>I</b> say your finger?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> you mean,” said Frodo, annoyed <b>and</b> alarmed.
<br>   “Oh yes, you <b>do</b>,” answered Strider; “<b>but</b> we <b>had</b> better wait until <b>the</b> uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, <b>I</b> should like a quiet word with you.”
<br>   “What about?” asked Frodo, ignoring <b>the</b> sudden <b>use</b> <b>of</b> his proper name.
<br>   “A matter <b>of</b> some importance—<b>to</b> us both,” answered Strider, looking Frodo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eye. “You may hear something <b>to</b> your advantage.”
<br>   “Very well,” said Frodo, trying <b>to</b> appear unconcerned. “<b>I</b>'ll talk <b>to</b> you later.”
<br>   Meanwhile an argument <b>was</b> going <b>on</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fireplace. Mr. Butterbur <b>had</b> come trotting <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> now trying <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> several conflicting accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event at <b>the</b> same time.
<br>   “<b>I</b> saw him, Mr. Butterbur,” said a hobbit; “<b>or</b> leastways <b>I</b> didn't see him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished <b>into</b> thin air, <b>in</b> a manner <b>of</b> speaking.”
<br>   “You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!” said <b>the</b> landlord, looking puzzled.
<br>   “Yes <b>I</b> <b>do</b>!” replied Mugwort. “And <b>I</b> mean <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say, <b>what</b>'s more.”
<br>   “There's some mistake somewhere,” said Butterbur, shaking his head. There <b>was</b> too much <b>of</b> that Mr. Underhill <b>to</b> go vanishing <b>into</b> thin air; <b>or</b> <b>into</b> thick air, as <b>is</b> more likely <b>in</b> this room.”
<br>   “Well, where <b>is</b> he now?” cried several voices.
<br>   “How should <b>I</b> know? He's welcome <b>to</b> go where he will, so long as he pays <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.”
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> saw <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> saw <b>what</b> <b>I</b> didn't,” said Mugwort obstinately.
<br>   “And <b>I</b> say there's some mistake,” repeated Butterbur, picking up <b>the</b> tray <b>and</b> gathering up <b>the</b> broken crockery.
<br>   “Of course there's a mistake!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> haven't vanished. Here <b>I</b> am! <b>I</b>'ve just been <b>having</b> a few words with Strider <b>in</b> <b>the</b> comer.”
<br>   He came forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> firelight; <b>but</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company backed away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> least satisfied <b>by</b> his explanation that he <b>had</b> crawled away quickly under <b>the</b> tables after he <b>had</b> fallen. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hobbits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Bree went off then <b>and</b> there <b>in</b> a huff, <b>having</b> <b>no</b> fancy for further entertainment that evening. One <b>or</b> two gave Frodo a black look <b>and</b> departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two <b>or</b> three strange Men that still remained got up <b>and</b> said good night <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landlord, <b>but</b> not <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> his friends. Before long <b>no</b> one <b>was</b> left <b>but</b> Strider, who sat <b>on</b>, unnoticed, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wall.
<br>   Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, <b>very</b> probably, that his house would be full again <b>on</b> many future nights, until <b>the</b> present mystery <b>had</b> been thoroughly discussed. “Now <b>what</b> have you been doing, Mr. Underhill?” he asked. “Frightening my customers <b>and</b> breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am <b>very</b> sorry <b>to</b> have caused any trouble,” said Frodo. “It <b>was</b> quite unintentional, <b>I</b> assure you. A most unfortunate accident.”
<br>   “All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any more tumbling, <b>or</b> conjuring, <b>or</b> whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, you'd best warn folk beforehand—<b>and</b> warn me. We're a bit suspicious round here <b>of</b> anything out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way -uncanny, if you understand me; <b>and</b> we don't take <b>to</b> <b>it</b> all <b>of</b> a sudden.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> shan't be doing anything <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort again, Mr. Butterbur, <b>I</b> promise you. And now <b>I</b> think <b>I</b>'ll be getting <b>to</b> bed. We shall be making an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready <b>by</b> eight o'clock?”
<br>   “Very good! But before you go, <b>I</b> should like a word with you <b>in</b> private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back <b>to</b> my mind that <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> tell you. <b>I</b> hope that you'll not take <b>it</b> amiss. When <b>I</b>'ve seen <b>to</b> a thing <b>or</b> two, <b>I</b>'ll come along <b>to</b> your room, if you're willing.”
<br>   “Certainly!” said Frodo; <b>but</b> his heart sank. He wondered how many private talks he would have before he got <b>to</b> bed, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they would reveal. Were these people all <b>in</b> league against him? He began <b>to</b> suspect even old Butterbur's fat face <b>of</b> concealing dark designs.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 10
<br>STRIDER
<br>
<br>   Frodo, Pippin, <b>and</b> Sam made their way back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> parlour. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> light. Merry <b>was</b> not there, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>had</b> burned low. It <b>was</b> not until they <b>had</b> puffed up <b>the</b> embers <b>into</b> a blaze <b>and</b> thrown <b>on</b> a couple <b>of</b> faggots that they discovered Strider <b>had</b> come with them. There he <b>was</b> calmly <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a chair <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door!
<br>   “Hallo!” said Pippin. “Who are you, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you want?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am called Strider,” he answered: “<b>and</b> though he may have forgotten <b>it</b>, your friend promised <b>to</b> have a quiet talk with me.”
<br>   “You said <b>I</b> might hear something <b>to</b> my advantage, <b>I</b> believe,” said Frodo. “What have you <b>to</b> say?”
<br>   “Several things,” answered Strider. “But, <b>of</b> course, <b>I</b> have my price.”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” asked Frodo sharply.
<br>   “Don't be alarmed! <b>I</b> mean just this: <b>I</b> will tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, <b>and</b> give you some good advice—<b>but</b> <b>I</b> shall want a reward.”
<br>   “And <b>what</b> will that be, pray?” said Frodo. He suspected now that he <b>had</b> fallen <b>in</b> with a rascal, <b>and</b> he <b>thought</b> uncomfortably that he <b>had</b> brought only a little money with him. All <b>of</b> <b>it</b> would hardly satisfy a rogue, <b>and</b> he could not spare any <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   “No more than you can afford,” answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. “Just this: you must take me along with you, until <b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> leave you.”
<br>   “Oh, indeed!” replied Frodo, surprised, <b>but</b> not much relieved. “Even if <b>I</b> wanted another companion, <b>I</b> should not agree <b>to</b> any such thing, until <b>I</b> knew a good deal more about you, <b>and</b> your business.”
<br>   “Excellent!” exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs <b>and</b> <b>sitting</b> back comfortably. “You seem <b>to</b> be coming <b>to</b> your senses again, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! <b>I</b> will tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> reward <b>to</b> you. You may be glad <b>to</b> grant <b>it</b>, when you have heard me.”
<br>   “Go <b>on</b> then!” said Frodo. “What <b>do</b> you know?”
<br>   “Too much; too many dark things,” said Strider grimly. “But as for your business—” He got up <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, opened <b>it</b> quickly <b>and</b> looked out. Then he shut <b>it</b> quietly <b>and</b> sat down again. “<b>I</b> have quick ears,” he went <b>on</b>, lowering his voice, “<b>and</b> though <b>I</b> cannot disappear, <b>I</b> have hunted many wild <b>and</b> wary things <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can usually avoid being seen, if <b>I</b> wish. Now, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> behind <b>the</b> hedge this evening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road west <b>of</b> Bree, when four hobbits came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Downlands. <b>I</b> need not repeat all that they said <b>to</b> old Bombadil <b>or</b> <b>to</b> one another, <b>but</b> one thing interested me. Please remember, said one <b>of</b> them, that <b>the</b> name Baggins must not be mentioned. <b>I</b> am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that <b>I</b> followed them here. <b>I</b> slipped over <b>the</b> gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; <b>but</b> if so, <b>I</b> should advise him <b>and</b> his friends <b>to</b> be more careful.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't see <b>what</b> interest my name has for any one <b>in</b> Bree,” said Frodo angrily, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> have still <b>to</b> learn why <b>it</b> interests you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying <b>and</b> eavesdropping; <b>but</b> if so, <b>I</b> should advise him <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Well answered!” said Strider laughing. “But <b>the</b> explanation <b>is</b> simple:
<br>   <b>I</b> <b>was</b> looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. <b>I</b> wanted <b>to</b> find him quickly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned that he <b>was</b> carrying out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, well, a secret that concerned me <b>and</b> my friends.
<br>   “Now, don't mistake me!” he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, <b>and</b> Sam jumped up with a scowl. “<b>I</b> shall take more care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret than you <b>do</b>. And care <b>is</b> needed!” He leaned forward <b>and</b> looked at them. “Watch every shadow!” he said <b>in</b> a low voice. “Black horsemen have passed through Bree. On Monday one came down <b>the</b> Greenway, they say; <b>and</b> another appeared later, coming up <b>the</b> Greenway from <b>the</b> south.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a silence. At last Frodo spoke <b>to</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam: “<b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> have guessed <b>it</b> from <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> gatekeeper greeted us,” he said. “And <b>the</b> landlord seems <b>to</b> have heard something. Why did he press us <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> company? And why <b>on</b> earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought <b>to</b> have stayed quiet <b>in</b> here.”
<br>   “It would have been better,” said Strider. “<b>I</b> would have stopped your going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> common-room, if <b>I</b> could; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper would not let me <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see you, <b>or</b> take a message.”
<br>   “Do you think he—” began Frodo.
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> don't think any harm <b>of</b> old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds <b>of</b> my sort.” Frodo gave him a puzzled look. “Well, <b>I</b> have rather a rascally look, have <b>I</b> not?” said Strider with a curl <b>of</b> his lip <b>and</b> a queer gleam <b>in</b> his eye. “But <b>I</b> hope we shall <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know one another better. When we <b>do</b>, <b>I</b> hope you will explain <b>what</b> happened at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your song. For that little prank—”
<br>   “It <b>was</b> sheer accident!” interrupted Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder,” said Strider. “Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.”
<br>   “Hardly more than <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> knew these horsemen were pursuing me; <b>but</b> now at any rate they seem <b>to</b> have missed me <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have gone away.”
<br>   “You must not count <b>on</b> that!” said Strider sharply. “They will return. And more are coming. There are others. <b>I</b> know their number. <b>I</b> know these Riders.” He paused, <b>and</b> his eyes were cold <b>and</b> hard. “And there are some folk <b>in</b> Bree who are not <b>to</b> be trusted,” he went <b>on</b>. “Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, <b>and</b> queer folk call at his house. You must have noticed him among <b>the</b> company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> close with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern strangers, <b>and</b> they slipped out together just after your “accident". Not all <b>of</b> those Southerners mean well; <b>and</b> as for Ferny, he would sell anything <b>to</b> anybody; <b>or</b> make mischief for amusement.”
<br>   “What will Ferny sell, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> has my accident got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him?” said Frodo, still determined not <b>to</b> understand Strider's hints.
<br>   “News <b>of</b> you, <b>of</b> course,” answered Strider. “An account <b>of</b> your performance would be <b>very</b> interesting <b>to</b> certain people. After that they would hardly need <b>to</b> be told your real name. It seems <b>to</b> me only too likely that they will hear <b>of</b> <b>it</b> before this night <b>is</b> over. Is that enough? You can <b>do</b> as you like about my reward: take me as a guide <b>or</b> not. But <b>I</b> may say that <b>I</b> know all <b>the</b> lands between <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, for <b>I</b> have wandered over them for many years. <b>I</b> am older than <b>I</b> look. <b>I</b> might prove useful. You will have <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> open road after tonight; for <b>the</b> horsemen will watch <b>it</b> night <b>and</b> day. You may escape from Bree, <b>and</b> be allowed <b>to</b> go forward while <b>the</b> Sun <b>is</b> up; <b>but</b> you won't go far. They will come <b>on</b> you <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild, <b>in</b> some dark place where there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> help. Do you wish them <b>to</b> find you? They are terrible!”
<br>   The hobbits looked at him, <b>and</b> saw with surprise that his face <b>was</b> drawn as if with pain, <b>and</b> his hands clenched <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> his chair. The room <b>was</b> <b>very</b> quiet <b>and</b> still, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light seemed <b>to</b> have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking <b>in</b> distant memory <b>or</b> listening <b>to</b> sounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Night far away.
<br>   “There!” he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. “Perhaps <b>I</b> know more about these pursuers than you <b>do</b>. You fear them, <b>but</b> you <b>do</b> not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have <b>to</b> escape, if you can. Strider can take you <b>by</b> paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a heavy silence. Frodo made <b>no</b> answer, his mind <b>was</b> confused with doubt <b>and</b> fear. Sam frowned, <b>and</b> looked at his master; <b>and</b> at last he broke out:
<br>   “With your leave, Mr. Frodo, <b>I</b>'d say <b>no</b>! This Strider here, he warns <b>and</b> he says take care; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say yes <b>to</b> that, <b>and</b> let's begin with him. He comes out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never heard <b>no</b> good <b>of</b> such folk. He knows something, that's plain, <b>and</b> more than <b>I</b> like; <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> reason why we should let him go leading us out <b>into</b> some dark place far from help, as he puts <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Pippin fidgeted <b>and</b> looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply <b>to</b> Sam, <b>but</b> turned his keen eyes <b>on</b> Frodo. Frodo caught his glance <b>and</b> looked away. “No,” he said slowly. “<b>I</b> don't agree. <b>I</b> think, <b>I</b> think you are not really as you choose <b>to</b> look. You began <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b> me like <b>the</b> Bree-folk, <b>but</b> your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right <b>in</b> this: <b>I</b> don't see why you should warn us <b>to</b> take care, <b>and</b> yet ask us <b>to</b> take you <b>on</b> trust. Why <b>the</b> disguise? Who are you? What <b>do</b> you really know about—about my business; <b>and</b> how <b>do</b> you know <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “The lesson <b>in</b> caution has been well learned,” said Strider with a grim smile. “But caution <b>is</b> one thing <b>and</b> wavering <b>is</b> another. You will never <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Rivendell now <b>on</b> your own, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> trust me <b>is</b> your only chance. You must make up your mind. <b>I</b> will answer some <b>of</b> your questions, if that will help you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. But why should you believe my story, if you <b>do</b> not trust me already? Still here <b>it</b> <b>is</b>—”
<br>   At that moment there came a knock at <b>the</b> door. Mr. Butterbur <b>had</b> arrived with candles, <b>and</b> behind him <b>was</b> Nob with cans <b>of</b> hot water. Strider withdrew <b>into</b> a dark corner.
<br>   “<b>I</b>'ve come <b>to</b> bid you good night,” said <b>the</b> landlord, putting <b>the</b> candles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. “Nob! Take <b>the</b> water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rooms!” He came <b>in</b> <b>and</b> shut <b>the</b> door.
<br>   “It's like this,” he began, hesitating <b>and</b> looking troubled. “If <b>I</b>'ve done any harm, <b>I</b>'m sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll admit; <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'m a busy man. But first one thing <b>and</b> then another this week have jogged my memory, as <b>the</b> saying goes; <b>and</b> not too late <b>I</b> hope. You see, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asked <b>to</b> look out for hobbits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> for one <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins <b>in</b> particular.”
<br>   “And <b>what</b> has that got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with me?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Ah! you know best,” said <b>the</b> landlord, knowingly. “<b>I</b> won't give you away; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told that this Baggins would be going <b>by</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Underhill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given a description that fits you well enough, if <b>I</b> may say so.”
<br>   “Indeed! Let's have <b>it</b> then!” said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.
<br>   “A stout little fellow with red cheeks,” said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, <b>but</b> Sam looked indignant. “That won't help you much; <b>it</b> goes for most hobbits. Barley, he says <b>to</b> me,” continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. “But this one <b>is</b> taller than some <b>and</b> fairer than most, <b>and</b> he has a cleft <b>in</b> his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your pardon, <b>but</b> he said <b>it</b>, not me.”
<br>   “He said <b>it</b>? And who <b>was</b> he?” asked Frodo eagerly.
<br>   “Ah! That <b>was</b> Gandalf, if you know who <b>I</b> mean. A wizard they say he <b>is</b>, <b>but</b> he's a good friend <b>of</b> mine, whether <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. But now <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> he'll have <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> me, if <b>I</b> see him again: turn all my ale sour <b>or</b> me <b>into</b> a block <b>of</b> wood, <b>I</b> shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still <b>what</b>'s done can't be undone.”
<br>   “Well, <b>what</b> have you done?” said Frodo, getting impatient with <b>the</b> slow unravelling <b>of</b> Butterbur's thoughts.
<br>   “Where <b>was</b> <b>I</b>?” said <b>the</b> landlord, pausing <b>and</b> snapping his fingers. “Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right <b>into</b> my room <b>without</b> a knock. Barley, he says, <b>I</b>'m off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Will you <b>do</b> something for me? You've only <b>to</b> name <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> said. <b>I</b>'m <b>in</b> a hurry, said he, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ve <b>no</b> time myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> want a message took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Have you anyone you can send, <b>and</b> trust <b>to</b> go? <b>I</b> can find someone, <b>I</b> said, tomorrow, maybe, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> day after. Make <b>it</b> tomorrow, he says, <b>and</b> then he gave me a letter.
<br>   “It's addressed plain enough,” said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>reading</b> out <b>the</b> address slowly <b>and</b> proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):
<br>   
<br>   Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SHIRE.
<br>   
<br>   “A letter for me from Gandalf!” cried Frodo.
<br>   “Ah!” said Mr. Butterbur. “Then your right name <b>is</b> Baggins?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b>,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> you <b>had</b> better give me that letter at <b>once</b>, <b>and</b> explain why you never sent <b>it</b>. That's <b>what</b> you came <b>to</b> tell me, <b>I</b> suppose, though you've taken a long time <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point.”
<br>   Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. “You're right, master,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> beg your pardon. And <b>I</b>'m mortal afraid <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Gandalf will say, if harm comes <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But <b>I</b> didn't keep <b>it</b> back a-purpose. <b>I</b> put <b>it</b> <b>by</b> safe. Then <b>I</b> couldn't find nobody willing <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire next day, nor <b>the</b> day after, <b>and</b> none <b>of</b> my own folk were <b>to</b> spare; <b>and</b> then one thing after another drove <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> my mind. <b>I</b>'m a busy man. <b>I</b>'ll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>to</b> set matters right, <b>and</b> if there's any help <b>I</b> can give, you've only <b>to</b> name <b>it</b>.
<br>   
<br>   “Leaving <b>the</b> letter aside, <b>I</b> promised Gandalf <b>no</b> less. Barley, he says <b>to</b> me, this friend <b>of</b> mine from <b>the</b> Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him <b>and</b> another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! But you need ask <b>no</b> questions. And if <b>I</b>'m not with him, he may be <b>in</b> trouble, <b>and</b> he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ll be grateful, he says. And here you are, <b>and</b> trouble <b>is</b> not far off, seemingly.”
<br>   
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “These black men,” said <b>the</b> landlord lowering his voice. “They're looking for Baggins, <b>and</b> if they mean well, then <b>I</b>'m a hobbit. It <b>was</b> <b>on</b> Monday, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> dogs were yammering <b>and</b> <b>the</b> geese screaming. Uncanny, <b>I</b> called <b>it</b>. Nob, he came <b>and</b> told me that two black men were at <b>the</b> door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair <b>was</b> all stood <b>on</b> end. <b>I</b> bid <b>the</b> black fellows be off, <b>and</b> slammed <b>the</b> door <b>on</b> them; <b>but</b> they've been asking <b>the</b> same question all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> Archet, <b>I</b> hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> here <b>to</b> see you, before you'd <b>had</b> bite <b>or</b> sup, he did.”
<br>   “He did!” said Strider suddenly, coming forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> light. “And much trouble would have been saved, if you <b>had</b> let him <b>in</b>, Barliman.”
<br>   The landlord jumped with surprise. “You!” he cried. “You're always popping up. What <b>do</b> you want now?”
<br>   “He's here with my leave,” said Frodo. “He came <b>to</b> offer me his help.”
<br>   “Well, you know your own business, maybe,” said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider. “But if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your plight, <b>I</b> wouldn't take up with a Ranger.”
<br>   “Then who would you take up with?” asked Strider. “A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout <b>it</b> at him all day? They cannot stay <b>in</b> The Pony for ever, <b>and</b> they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them <b>and</b> keep <b>the</b> black men off?”
<br>   “Me? Leave Bree! <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>do</b> that for any money,” said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. “But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings <b>on</b>? What are these black men after, <b>and</b> where <b>do</b> they come from, <b>I</b>'d like <b>to</b> know?”
<br>   “<b>I</b>'m sorry <b>I</b> can't explain <b>it</b> all,” answered Frodo. “<b>I</b> am <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> <b>very</b> worried, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>'s a long tale. But if you mean <b>to</b> help me, <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> warn you that you will be <b>in</b> danger as long as <b>I</b> am <b>in</b> your house. These Black Riders: <b>I</b> am not sure, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think, <b>I</b> fear they come from—”
<br>   “They come from Mordor,” said Strider <b>in</b> a low voice. “From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “Save us!” cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; <b>the</b> name evidently <b>was</b> known <b>to</b> him. “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> worst news that has come <b>to</b> Bree <b>in</b> my time.” “It <b>is</b>,” said Frodo. “Are you still willing <b>to</b> help me?” “<b>I</b> am,” said Mr. Butterbur. “More than ever. Though <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> likes <b>of</b> me can <b>do</b> against, against—” he faltered.
<br>   “Against <b>the</b> Shadow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East,” said Strider quietly. “Not much, Barliman, <b>but</b> every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill, <b>and</b> you can forget <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Baggins, till he <b>is</b> far away.”
<br>   “<b>I</b>'ll <b>do</b> that,” said Butterbur. “But they'll find out he's here <b>without</b> help from me, <b>I</b>'m afraid. It's a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention <b>to</b> himself this evening, <b>to</b> say <b>no</b> more. The story <b>of</b> that Mr. Bilbo's going off has been heard before tonight <b>in</b> Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing <b>in</b> his slow pate: <b>and</b> there are others <b>in</b> Bree quicker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uptake than he <b>is</b>.”
<br>   “Well, we can only hope <b>the</b> Riders won't come back yet,” said Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope not, indeed,” said Butterbur. “But spooks <b>or</b> <b>no</b> spooks, they won't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till <b>the</b> morning. Nob'll say <b>no</b> word. No black man shall pass my doors, while <b>I</b> can stand <b>on</b> my legs. Me <b>and</b> my folk'll keep watch tonight; <b>but</b> you <b>had</b> best <b>get</b> some sleep, if you can.”
<br>   “In any case we must be called at dawn,” said Frodo. “We must <b>get</b> off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.”
<br>   “Right! <b>I</b>'ll see <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orders,” said <b>the</b> landlord. “Good night, Mr. Baggins—Underhill, <b>I</b> should say! Good night—now, bless me! Where's your Mr. Brandybuck?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know,” said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They <b>had</b> forgotten all about Merry, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> getting late. “<b>I</b> am afraid he <b>is</b> out. He said something about going for a breath <b>of</b> air.”
<br>   “Well, you <b>do</b> want looking after <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake: your party might be <b>on</b> a holiday!” said Butterbur. “<b>I</b> must go <b>and</b> bar <b>the</b> doors quick, <b>but</b> <b>I</b>'ll see your friend <b>is</b> let <b>in</b> when he comes. <b>I</b>'d better send Nob <b>to</b> look for him. Good night <b>to</b> you all!” At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another doubtful look at Strider <b>and</b> a shake <b>of</b> his head. His footsteps retreated down <b>the</b> passage.
<br>   “Well?” said Strider. “When are you going <b>to</b> open that letter?” Frodo looked carefully at <b>the</b> seal before he broke <b>it</b>. It seemed certainly <b>to</b> be Gandalf's. Inside, written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wizard's strong <b>but</b> graceful script, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> following message:
<br>   
<br>   <b>THE</b> PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418.
<br>   Dear Frodo,
<br>   Bad news has reached me here. <b>I</b> must go off at <b>once</b>. You <b>had</b> better leave Bag End soon, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> July at latest. <b>I</b> will return as soon as <b>I</b> can; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will follow you, if <b>I</b> find that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust <b>the</b> landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend <b>of</b> mine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, <b>by</b> some called Strider. He knows our business <b>and</b> will help you. Make for Rivendell. There <b>I</b> hope we may meet again. If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come, Elrond will advise you.
<br>   Yours <b>in</b> haste
<br>   GANDALF. 
<br>   PS. Do NOT <b>use</b> It again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel <b>by</b> night! 
<br>   PPS. Make sure that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real Strider. There are many strange men <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads. His true name <b>is</b> Aragorn. 
<br>All that <b>is</b> gold does not glitter,
<br>Not all those who wander are lost;
<br>The old that <b>is</b> strong does not wither,
<br>Deep roots are not reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frost.
<br>From <b>the</b> ashes a fire shall be woken,
<br>A light from <b>the</b> shadows shall spring;
<br>Renewed shall be blade that <b>was</b> broken,
<br>The crownless again shall be king.
<br>   
<br>   
<br>   PPPS. <b>I</b> hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, <b>but</b> his memory <b>is</b> like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, <b>I</b> shall roast him.
<br>   Fare Well!
<br>   
<br>   Frodo read <b>the</b> letter <b>to</b> himself, <b>and</b> then passed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Pippin <b>and</b> Sam. “Really old Butterbur has made a mess <b>of</b> things!” he said. “He deserves roasting. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got this at <b>once</b>, we might all have been safe <b>in</b> Rivendell <b>by</b> now. But <b>what</b> can have happened <b>to</b> Gandalf? He writes as if he <b>was</b> going <b>into</b> great danger.”
<br>   “He has been doing that for many years,” said Strider.
<br>   Frodo turned <b>and</b> looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's second postscript. “Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at <b>once</b>?” he asked. “It would have saved time.”
<br>   “Would <b>it</b>? Would any <b>of</b> you have believed me till now?” said Strider. “<b>I</b> knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> this letter. For all <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> persuade you <b>to</b> trust me <b>without</b> proofs, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> help you. In any case, <b>I</b> did not intend <b>to</b> tell you all about myself at <b>once</b>. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> study you first, <b>and</b> make sure <b>of</b> you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made up my mind, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ready <b>to</b> tell you whatever you asked. But <b>I</b> must admit,” he added with a queer laugh, “that <b>I</b> hoped you would take <b>to</b> me for my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies <b>of</b> distrust <b>and</b> longs for friendship. But there, <b>I</b> believe my looks are against me.”
<br>   “They are—at first sight at any rate,” laughed Pippin with sudden relief after <b>reading</b> Gandalf's letter. “But handsome <b>is</b> as handsome does, as we say <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> daresay we shall all look much <b>the</b> same after lying for days <b>in</b> hedges <b>and</b> ditches.”
<br>   “It would take more than a few days, <b>or</b> weeks, <b>or</b> years, <b>of</b> wandering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild <b>to</b> make you look like Strider,” he answered. “And you would die first, unless you are made <b>of</b> sterner stuff than you look <b>to</b> be.”
<br>   Pippin subsided; <b>but</b> Sam <b>was</b> not daunted, <b>and</b> he still eyed Strider dubiously. “How <b>do</b> we know you are <b>the</b> Strider that Gandalf speaks about?” he demanded. “You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all <b>I</b> can see, trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us <b>to</b> go with you. You might have done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real Strider <b>and</b> took his clothes. What have you <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> that?”
<br>   “That you are a stout fellow,” answered Strider; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> am afraid my only answer <b>to</b> you, Sam Gamgee, <b>is</b> this. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> killed <b>the</b> real Strider, <b>I</b> could kill you. And <b>I</b> should have killed you already <b>without</b> so much talk. If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> after <b>the</b> Ring, <b>I</b> could have <b>it</b>—NOW!”
<br>   He stood up, <b>and</b> seemed suddenly <b>to</b> grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen <b>and</b> commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> a sword that <b>had</b> hung concealed <b>by</b> his side. They did not dare <b>to</b> move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.
<br>   “But <b>I</b> am <b>the</b> real Strider, fortunately,” he said, looking down at them with his face softened <b>by</b> a sudden smile. “<b>I</b> am Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn; <b>and</b> if <b>by</b> life <b>or</b> death <b>I</b> can save you, <b>I</b> will.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. “<b>I</b> believed that you were a friend before <b>the</b> letter came,” he said, “<b>or</b> at least <b>I</b> wished <b>to</b>. You have frightened me several times tonight, <b>but</b> never <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way that servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy would, <b>or</b> so <b>I</b> imagine. <b>I</b> think one <b>of</b> his spies would—well, seem fairer <b>and</b> feel fouler, if you understand.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> see,” laughed Strider. “<b>I</b> look foul <b>and</b> feel fair. Is that <b>it</b>? All that <b>is</b> gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.”
<br>   “Did <b>the</b> verses apply <b>to</b> you then?” asked Frodo. “<b>I</b> could not make out <b>what</b> they were about. But how did you know that they were <b>in</b> Gandalf's letter, if you have never seen <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> did not know,” he answered. “But <b>I</b> am Aragorn, <b>and</b> those verses go with that name.” He drew out his sword, <b>and</b> they saw that <b>the</b> blade <b>was</b> indeed broken a foot below <b>the</b> hilt. “Not much <b>use</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b>, Sam?” said Strider. “But <b>the</b> time <b>is</b> near when <b>it</b> shall be forged anew.”
<br>   Sam said <b>nothing</b>.
<br>   “Well,” said Strider, “with Sam's permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed <b>to</b> leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b> unnoticed. But <b>I</b> shall try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> lost as soon as possible. <b>I</b> know one <b>or</b> two ways out <b>of</b> Bree-land other than <b>the</b> main road. If <b>once</b> we shake off <b>the</b> pursuit, <b>I</b> shall make for Weathertop.”
<br>   “Weathertop?” said Sam. “What's that?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> a hill, just <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, about half way from here <b>to</b> Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; <b>and</b> there we shall have a chance <b>to</b> look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, <b>and</b> we shall have <b>to</b> choose between various dangers.”
<br>   “When did you last see Gandalf?” asked Frodo. “Do you know where he <b>is</b>, <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he <b>is</b> doing?”
<br>   Strider looked grave. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know,” he said. “<b>I</b> came west with him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring. <b>I</b> have often kept watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few years, when he <b>was</b> busy elsewhere. He seldom left <b>it</b> unguarded. We last met <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>of</b> May: at Sam Ford down <b>the</b> Brandywine. He told me that his business with you <b>had</b> gone well, <b>and</b> that you would be starting for Rivendell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last week <b>of</b> September. As <b>I</b> knew he <b>was</b> at your side, <b>I</b> went away <b>on</b> a journey <b>of</b> my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some news reached him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not at hand <b>to</b> help.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am troubled, for <b>the</b> first time since <b>I</b> have known him. We should have <b>had</b> messages, even if he could not come himself. When <b>I</b> returned, many days ago, <b>I</b> heard <b>the</b> ill news. The tidings <b>had</b> gone far <b>and</b> wide that Gandalf <b>was</b> missing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> horsemen <b>had</b> been seen. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Elven-folk <b>of</b> Gildor that told me this; <b>and</b> later they told me that you <b>had</b> left your home; <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> news <b>of</b> your leaving Buckland. <b>I</b> have been watching <b>the</b> East Road anxiously.”
<br>   “Do you think <b>the</b> Black Riders have anything <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>it</b>—with Gandalf's absence, <b>I</b> mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>of</b> anything else that could have hindered him, except <b>the</b> Enemy himself,” said Strider. “But <b>do</b> not give up hope! Gandalf <b>is</b> greater than you Shire-folk know—as a rule you can only see his jokes <b>and</b> toys. But this business <b>of</b> ours will be his greatest task.”
<br>   Pippin yawned. “<b>I</b> am sorry,” he said, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> am dead <b>tired</b>. In spite <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> danger <b>and</b> worry <b>I</b> must go <b>to</b> bed, <b>or</b> sleep where <b>I</b> sit. Where <b>is</b> that silly fellow, Merry? It would be <b>the</b> last straw, if we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>to</b> look for him.”
<br>   At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along <b>the</b> passage. Merry came <b>in</b> with a rush followed <b>by</b> Nob. He shut <b>the</b> door hastily, <b>and</b> leaned against <b>it</b>. He <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> breath. They stared at him <b>in</b> alarm for a moment before he gasped: “<b>I</b> have seen them, Frodo! <b>I</b> have seen them! Black Riders!”
<br>   “Black Riders!” cried Frodo. “Where?”
<br>   “Here. In <b>the</b> village. <b>I</b> stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, <b>I</b> went out for a stroll. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come back again <b>and</b> <b>was</b> standing just outside <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamp looking at <b>the</b> stars. Suddenly <b>I</b> shivered <b>and</b> felt that something horrible <b>was</b> creeping near: there <b>was</b> a son <b>of</b> deeper shade among <b>the</b> shadows across <b>the</b> road, just beyond <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lamplight. It slid away at <b>once</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>without</b> a sound. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> horse.”
<br>   “Which way did <b>it</b> go?” asked Strider, suddenly <b>and</b> sharply. Merry started, noticing <b>the</b> stranger for <b>the</b> first time. “Go <b>on</b>!” said Frodo. “This <b>is</b> a friend <b>of</b> Gandalf's. <b>I</b> will explain later.”
<br>   “It seemed <b>to</b> make off up <b>the</b> Road, eastward,” continued Merry. “<b>I</b> tried <b>to</b> follow. Of course, <b>it</b> vanished almost at <b>once</b>; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> went round <b>the</b> corner <b>and</b> <b>on</b> as far as <b>the</b> last house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   Strider looked at Merry with wonder. “You have a stout heart,” he said; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> foolish.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know,” said Merry. “Neither brave nor silly, <b>I</b> think. <b>I</b> could hardly help myself. <b>I</b> seemed <b>to</b> be drawn somehow. Anyway, <b>I</b> went, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>I</b> heard voices <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hedge. One <b>was</b> muttering; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> whispering, <b>or</b> hissing. <b>I</b> couldn't hear a word that <b>was</b> said. <b>I</b> did not creep any closer, because <b>I</b> began <b>to</b> tremble all over. Then <b>I</b> felt terrified, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> turned back, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> just going <b>to</b> bolt home, when something came behind me <b>and</b> <b>I</b>... <b>I</b> fell over.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> found him, sir,” put <b>in</b> Nob. “Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. <b>I</b> went down <b>to</b> West-gate, <b>and</b> then back up towards South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny's house <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could see something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Road. <b>I</b> couldn't swear <b>to</b> <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> looked <b>to</b> me as if two men <b>was</b> stooping over something, lilting <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> gave a shout, <b>but</b> where <b>I</b> got up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> only Mr. Brandybuck lying <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roadside. He seemed <b>to</b> be asleep. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> fallen <b>into</b> deep water,” he says <b>to</b> me, when <b>I</b> shook him. Very queer he <b>was</b>, <b>and</b> as soon as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> roused him, he got up <b>and</b> ran back here like a hare.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am afraid that's true,” said Merry, “though <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an ugly dream, which <b>I</b> can't remember. <b>I</b> went <b>to</b> pieces. <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> came over me.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>,” said Strider. “The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, <b>and</b> passed back through <b>the</b> South-gate <b>in</b> secret. They will know all <b>the</b> news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; <b>and</b> probably that Southerner <b>was</b> a spy as well. Something may happen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, before we leave Bree.”
<br>   “What will happen?” said Merry. “Will they attack <b>the</b> inn?” “No, <b>I</b> think not,” said Strider. “They are not all here yet. And <b>in</b> any case that <b>is</b> not their way. In dark <b>and</b> loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights <b>and</b> many people -not until they are desperate, not while all <b>the</b> long leagues <b>of</b> Eriador still lie before us. But their power <b>is</b> <b>in</b> terror, <b>and</b> already some <b>in</b> Bree are <b>in</b> their clutch. They will drive these wretches <b>to</b> some evil work: Ferny, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strangers, <b>and</b>, maybe, <b>the</b> gatekeeper too. They <b>had</b> words with Harry at West-gate <b>on</b> Monday. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> watching them. He <b>was</b> white <b>and</b> shaking when they left him.”
<br>   “We seem <b>to</b> have enemies all round,” said Frodo. “What are we <b>to</b> <b>do</b>?”
<br>   “Stay here, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not go <b>to</b> your rooms! They are sure <b>to</b> have found out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north <b>and</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. We will all remain together <b>and</b> bar this window <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door. But first Nob <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will fetch your luggage.”
<br>   While Strider <b>was</b> gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account <b>of</b> all that <b>had</b> happened since supper. Merry <b>was</b> still <b>reading</b> <b>and</b> pondering Gandalf's letter when Strider <b>and</b> Nob returned.
<br>   “Well Masters,” said Nob, “<b>I</b>'ve ruffled up <b>the</b> clothes <b>and</b> put <b>in</b> a bolster down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> each bed. And <b>I</b> made a nice imitation <b>of</b> your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag—Underhill, sir,” he added with a grin.
<br>   Pippin laughed. “Very life-like!” he said. “But <b>what</b> will happen when they have penetrated <b>the</b> disguise?”
<br>   “We shall see,” said Strider. “Let us hope <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> fort till morning.”
<br>   “Good night <b>to</b> you,” said Nob, <b>and</b> went off <b>to</b> take his part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors.
<br>   Their bags <b>and</b> gear they piled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> shut <b>the</b> window. Peering out, Frodo saw that <b>the</b> night <b>was</b> still clear. The Sickle <b>was</b> swinging bright above <b>the</b> shoulders <b>of</b> Bree-hill. He then closed <b>and</b> barred <b>the</b> heavy inside shutters <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> curtains together. Strider built up <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> blew out all <b>the</b> candles.
<br>   The hobbits lay down <b>on</b> their blankets with their feet towards <b>the</b> hearth; <b>but</b> Strider settled himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chair against <b>the</b> door. They talked for a little, for Merry still <b>had</b> several questions <b>to</b> ask.
<br>   “Jumped over <b>the</b> Moon!” chuckled Merry as he rolled himself <b>in</b> his blanket. “Very ridiculous <b>of</b> you, Frodo! But <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there <b>to</b> see. The worthies <b>of</b> Bree will be discussing <b>it</b> a hundred years hence.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope so,” said Strider. Then they all fell silent, <b>and</b> one <b>by</b> one <b>the</b> hobbits dropped off <b>to</b> sleep.
<br>   
<br>   
<br><b>Chapter</b> 11
<br>A KNIFE IN <b>THE</b> DARK
<br>
<br>   As they prepared for sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inn at Bree, darkness lay <b>on</b> Buckland; a mist strayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dells <b>and</b> along <b>the</b> river-<b>bank</b>. The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened <b>the</b> door cautiously <b>and</b> peered out. A feeling <b>of</b> fear <b>had</b> been growing <b>on</b> him all day, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> unable <b>to</b> rest <b>or</b> go <b>to</b> bed: there <b>was</b> a brooding threat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breathless night-air. As he stared out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom, a black shadow moved under <b>the</b> trees; <b>the</b> gate seemed <b>to</b> open <b>of</b> its own accord <b>and</b> close again <b>without</b> a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, <b>and</b> for a moment he stood trembling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall. Then he shut <b>and</b> locked <b>the</b> door.
<br>   The night deepened. There came <b>the</b> soft sound <b>of</b> horses led with stealth along <b>the</b> lane. Outside <b>the</b> gate they stopped, <b>and</b> three black figures entered, like shades <b>of</b> night creeping across <b>the</b> ground. One went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, one <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>on</b> either side; <b>and</b> there they stood, as still as <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> stones, while night went slowly <b>on</b>. The house <b>and</b> <b>the</b> quiet trees seemed <b>to</b> be waiting breathlessly.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a faint stir <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leaves, <b>and</b> a cock crowed far away. The cold hour before dawn <b>was</b> passing. The figure <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door moved. In <b>the</b> dark <b>without</b> moon <b>or</b> stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light <b>had</b> been unsheathed. There <b>was</b> a blow, soft <b>but</b> heavy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> door shuddered.
<br>   “Open, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Mordor!” said a voice thin <b>and</b> menacing.
<br>   At a second blow <b>the</b> door yielded <b>and</b> fell back, with timbers burst <b>and</b> lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly <b>in</b>.
<br>   At that moment, among <b>the</b> trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent <b>the</b> night like fire <b>on</b> a hill-top.
<br>   awake! fear! fire! foes! awake!
<br>   Fatty Bolger <b>had</b> not been idle. As soon as he saw <b>the</b> dark shapes creep from <b>the</b> garden, he knew that he must run for <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> perish. And run he did, out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back door, through <b>the</b> garden, <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> fields. When he reached <b>the</b> nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep. “No, <b>no</b>, <b>no</b>!” he <b>was</b> crying. “No, not me! <b>I</b> haven't got <b>it</b>!” It <b>was</b> some time before anyone could make out <b>what</b> he <b>was</b> babbling about. At last they got <b>the</b> idea that enemies were <b>in</b> Buckland, some strange invasion from <b>the</b> Old Forest. And then they lost <b>no</b> more time.
<br>   fear! fire! foes!
<br>   The Brandybucks were blowing <b>the</b> Horn-call <b>of</b> Buckland, that <b>had</b> not been sounded for a hundred years, not since <b>the</b> white wolves came <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fell Winter, when <b>the</b> Brandywine <b>was</b> frozen over.
<br>   awake! awake!
<br>   Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm <b>was</b> spreading. The black figures fled from <b>the</b> house. One <b>of</b> them let fall a hobbit-cloak <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step, as he ran. In <b>the</b> lane <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> hoofs broke out, <b>and</b> gathering <b>to</b> a gallop, went hammering away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. All about Crickhollow there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> horns blowing, <b>and</b> voices crying <b>and</b> feet running. But <b>the</b> Black Riders rode like a gale <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North-gate. Let <b>the</b> little people blow! Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they <b>had</b> another errand: they knew now that <b>the</b> house <b>was</b> empty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>had</b> gone. They rode down <b>the</b> guards at <b>the</b> gate <b>and</b> vanished from <b>the</b> Shire.
<br>   In <b>the</b> early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound <b>or</b> presence <b>had</b> disturbed him. He saw that Strider <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> alert <b>in</b> his chair: his eyes gleamed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, which <b>had</b> been tended <b>and</b> <b>was</b> burning brightly; <b>but</b> he made <b>no</b> sign <b>or</b> movement.
<br>   Frodo soon went <b>to</b> sleep again; <b>but</b> his dreams were again troubled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> wind <b>and</b> <b>of</b> galloping hoofs. The wind seemed <b>to</b> be curling round <b>the</b> house <b>and</b> shaking <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, <b>and</b> heard a cock crowing lustily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inn-yard. Strider <b>had</b> drawn <b>the</b> curtains <b>and</b> pushed back <b>the</b> shutters with a clang. The first grey light <b>of</b> day <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, <b>and</b> a cold air <b>was</b> coming through <b>the</b> open window.
<br>   As soon as Strider <b>had</b> roused them all, he led <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> their bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they <b>had</b> taken his advice: <b>the</b> windows <b>had</b> been forced open <b>and</b> were swinging, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> curtains were flapping; <b>the</b> beds were tossed about, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bolsters slashed <b>and</b> flung upon <b>the</b> floor; <b>the</b> brown mat <b>was</b> torn <b>to</b> pieces.
<br>   Strider immediately went <b>to</b> fetch <b>the</b> landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy <b>and</b> frightened. He <b>had</b> hardly closed his eyes all night (so he said), <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> never heard a sound.
<br>   “Never has such a thing happened <b>in</b> my time!” he cried, raising his hands <b>in</b> horror. “Guests unable <b>to</b> sleep <b>in</b> their beds, <b>and</b> good bolsters ruined <b>and</b> all! What are we coming <b>to</b>?”
<br>   “Dark times,” said Strider. “But for <b>the</b> present you may be left <b>in</b> peace, when you have got rid <b>of</b> us. We will leave at <b>once</b>. Never mind about breakfast: a drink <b>and</b> a bite standing will have <b>to</b> <b>do</b>. We shall be packed <b>in</b> a few minutes.”
<br>   Mr. Butterbur hurried off <b>to</b> see that their ponies were got ready, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> fetch them a “bite”. But <b>very</b> soon he came back <b>in</b> dismay. The ponies <b>had</b> vanished! The stable-doors <b>had</b> all been opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> they were gone: not only Merry's ponies, <b>but</b> every other horse <b>and</b> beast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place.
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> crushed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news. How could they hope <b>to</b> reach Rivendell <b>on</b> foot, pursued <b>by</b> mounted enemies? They might as well set out for <b>the</b> Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at <b>the</b> hobbits, as if he <b>was</b> weighing up their strength <b>and</b> courage.
<br>   “Ponies would not help us <b>to</b> escape horsemen,” he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed <b>what</b> Frodo <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind. “We should not go much slower <b>on</b> foot, not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads that <b>I</b> mean <b>to</b> take. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> walk <b>in</b> any case. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> food <b>and</b> stores that trouble me. We cannot count <b>on</b> getting anything <b>to</b> eat between here <b>and</b> Rivendell, except <b>what</b> we take with us; <b>and</b> we ought <b>to</b> take plenty <b>to</b> spare; for we may be delayed, <b>or</b> forced <b>to</b> go round-about, far out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct way. How much are you prepared <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> your backs?”
<br>   “As much as we must,” said Pippin with a sinking heart, <b>but</b> trying <b>to</b> show that he <b>was</b> tougher than he looked (<b>or</b> felt).
<br>   “<b>I</b> can carry enough for two,” said Sam defiantly.
<br>   “Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?” asked Frodo. “Can't we <b>get</b> a couple <b>of</b> ponies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village, <b>or</b> even one just for <b>the</b> baggage? <b>I</b> don't suppose we could hire them, <b>but</b> we might be able <b>to</b> buy them,” he added, doubtfully, wondering if he could afford <b>it</b>.
<br>   “<b>I</b> doubt <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> landlord unhappily. “The two <b>or</b> three riding-ponies that there were <b>in</b> Bree were stabled <b>in</b> my yard, <b>and</b> they're gone. As for other animals, horses <b>or</b> ponies for draught <b>or</b> <b>what</b> not, there are <b>very</b> few <b>of</b> them <b>in</b> Bree, <b>and</b> they won't be for sale. But <b>I</b>'ll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b>'ll rout out Bob <b>and</b> send him round as soon as may be.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Strider reluctantly, “you <b>had</b> better <b>do</b> that. <b>I</b> am afraid we shall have <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one pony at least. But so ends all hope <b>of</b> starting early, <b>and</b> slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn <b>to</b> announce our departure. That <b>was</b> part <b>of</b> their plan, <b>no</b> doubt.”
<br>   “There <b>is</b> one crumb <b>of</b> comfort,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> more than a crumb, <b>I</b> hope: we can have breakfast while we wait—<b>and</b> sit down <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. Let's <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> Nob!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> end there <b>was</b> more than three hours” delay. Bob came back with <b>the</b> report that <b>no</b> horse <b>or</b> pony <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be got for love <b>or</b> money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbourhood—except one: Bill Ferny <b>had</b> one that he might possibly sell. “A poor old half-starved creature <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” said Bob; “<b>but</b> he won't part with <b>it</b> for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if <b>I</b> knows Bill Ferny.”
<br>   “Bill Ferny?” said Frodo. “Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't <b>the</b> beast bolt back <b>to</b> him with all our stuff, <b>or</b> help <b>in</b> tracking us, <b>or</b> something?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder,” said Strider. “But <b>I</b> cannot imagine any animal running home <b>to</b> him, <b>once</b> <b>it</b> got away. <b>I</b> fancy this <b>is</b> only an afterthought <b>of</b> kind Master Ferny's: just a way <b>of</b> increasing his profits from <b>the</b> affair. The chief danger <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> poor beast <b>is</b> probably at death's door. But there does not seem any choice. What does he want for <b>it</b>?”
<br>   Bill Ferny's price <b>was</b> twelve silver pennies; <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> indeed at least three times <b>the</b> pony's value <b>in</b> those pans. It proved <b>to</b> be a bony, underfed, <b>and</b> dispirited animal; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for <b>it</b> himself, <b>and</b> offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for <b>the</b> lost animals. He <b>was</b> an honest man, <b>and</b> well-off as things were reckoned <b>in</b> Bree; <b>but</b> thirty silver pennies <b>was</b> a sore blow <b>to</b> him, <b>and</b> being cheated <b>by</b> Bill Ferny made <b>it</b> harder <b>to</b> bear.
<br>   As a matter <b>of</b> fact he came out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end. It turned out later that only one horse <b>had</b> been actually stolen. The others <b>had</b> been driven off, <b>or</b> <b>had</b> bolted <b>in</b> terror, <b>and</b> were found wandering <b>in</b> different corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land. Merry's ponies <b>had</b> escaped altogether, <b>and</b> eventually (<b>having</b> a good deal <b>of</b> sense) they made their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Downs <b>in</b> search <b>of</b> Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> Tom Bombadil for a while, <b>and</b> were well-off. But when news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events at Bree came <b>to</b> Tom's ears, he sent them <b>to</b> Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a <b>very</b> fair price. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work harder <b>in</b> Bree, <b>but</b> Bob treated them well; so <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole they were lucky: they missed a dark <b>and</b> dangerous journey. But they never came <b>to</b> Rivendell.
<br>   However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money <b>was</b> gone for good, <b>or</b> for bad. And he <b>had</b> other troubles. For there <b>was</b> a great commotion as soon as <b>the</b> remaining guests were astir <b>and</b> heard news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inn. The southern travellers <b>had</b> lost several horses <b>and</b> blamed <b>the</b> innkeeper loudly, until <b>it</b> became known that one <b>of</b> their own number <b>had</b> also disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell <b>on</b> him at <b>once</b>.
<br>   “If you pick up with a horse-thief, <b>and</b> bring him <b>to</b> my house,” said Butterbur angrily, “you ought <b>to</b> pay for all <b>the</b> damage yourselves <b>and</b> not come shouting at me. Go <b>and</b> ask Ferny where your handsome friend <b>is</b>!” But <b>it</b> appeared that he <b>was</b> nobody's friend, <b>and</b> nobody could recollect when he <b>had</b> joined their party.
<br>   After their breakfast <b>the</b> hobbits <b>had</b> <b>to</b> re-pack, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> together further supplies for <b>the</b> longer journey they were now expecting. It <b>was</b> close <b>on</b> ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that time <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Bree <b>was</b> buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horsemen; <b>the</b> robbing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stables; <b>and</b> not least <b>the</b> news that Strider <b>the</b> Ranger <b>had</b> joined <b>the</b> mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants <b>of</b> Bree <b>and</b> Staddle, <b>and</b> many even from Combe <b>and</b> Archet, were crowded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> travellers start. The other guests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inn were at <b>the</b> doors <b>or</b> hanging out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows.
<br>   Strider <b>had</b> changed his mind, <b>and</b> he decided <b>to</b> leave Bree <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main road. Any attempt <b>to</b> set off across country at <b>once</b> would only make matters worse: half <b>the</b> inhabitants would follow them, <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> they were up <b>to</b>, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from trespassing.
<br>   They said farewell <b>to</b> Nob <b>and</b> Bob, <b>and</b> took leave <b>of</b> Mr. Butterbur with many thanks. “<b>I</b> hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry <b>once</b> more,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> should like <b>nothing</b> better than <b>to</b> stay <b>in</b> your house <b>in</b> peace for a while.”
<br>   They tramped off, anxious <b>and</b> downhearted, under <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd. Not all <b>the</b> faces were friendly, nor all <b>the</b> words that were shouted. But Strider seemed <b>to</b> be held <b>in</b> awe <b>by</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-landers, <b>and</b> those that he stared at shut their mouths <b>and</b> drew away. He walked <b>in</b> front with Frodo; next came Merry <b>and</b> Pippin; <b>and</b> last came Sam leading <b>the</b> pony, which <b>was</b> laden with as much <b>of</b> their baggage as they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> give <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> already <b>it</b> looked less dejected, as if <b>it</b> approved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> its fortunes. Sam <b>was</b> chewing an apple thoughtfully. He <b>had</b> a pocket full <b>of</b> them: a parting present from Nob <b>and</b> Bob. “Apples for walking, <b>and</b> a pipe for <b>sitting</b>,” he said. “But <b>I</b> reckon <b>I</b>'ll miss them both before long.”
<br>   The hobbits took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inquisitive heads that <b>peeped</b> out <b>of</b> doors, <b>or</b> popped over walls <b>and</b> fences, as they passed. But as they drew near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: <b>the</b> last house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village. In one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windows he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> vanished at <b>once</b>.
<br>   “So that's where that southerner <b>is</b> hiding!” he <b>thought</b>. “He looks more than half like a goblin.”
<br>   Over <b>the</b> hedge another man <b>was</b> staring boldly. He <b>had</b> heavy black brows, <b>and</b> dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled <b>in</b> a sneer. He <b>was</b> smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took <b>it</b> out <b>of</b> his mouth <b>and</b> spat.
<br>   “Morning, Longshanks!” he said. “Off early? Found some friends at last?” Strider nodded, <b>but</b> did not answer. “Morning, my little friends!” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “<b>I</b> suppose you know who you've taken up with? That's Stick-at-naught Strider, that <b>is</b>! Though <b>I</b>'ve heard other names not so pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor old pony! Pah!” He spat again.
<br>   Sam turned quickly. “And you. Ferny,” he said, “put your ugly face out <b>of</b> sight, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> will <b>get</b> hurt.” With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an apple left his hand <b>and</b> hit Bill square <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nose. He ducked too late, <b>and</b> curses came from behind <b>the</b> hedge. “Waste <b>of</b> a good apple,” said Sam regretfully, <b>and</b> strode <b>on</b>.
<br>   At last they left <b>the</b> village behind. The escort <b>of</b> children <b>and</b> stragglers that <b>had</b> followed them got <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> turned back at <b>the</b> South-gate. Passing through, they kept <b>on</b> along <b>the</b> Road for some miles. It bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, curving back <b>into</b> its eastward line as <b>it</b> rounded <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> Bree-hill, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> run swiftly downwards <b>into</b> wooded country. To their left they could see some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> houses <b>and</b> hobbit-holes <b>of</b> Staddle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gentler south-eastern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill; down <b>in</b> a deep hollow away north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road there were wisps <b>of</b> rising smoke that showed where Combe lay;
<br>   Archet <b>was</b> hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees beyond.
<br>   After <b>the</b> Road <b>had</b> run down some way, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> left Bree-hill standing tall <b>and</b> brown behind, they came <b>on</b> a narrow track that led off towards <b>the</b> North. “This <b>is</b> where we leave <b>the</b> open <b>and</b> take <b>to</b> cover,” said Strider.
<br>   “Not a “short cut", <b>I</b> hope,” said Pippin. “Our last short cut through woods nearly ended <b>in</b> disaster.”
<br>   “Ah, <b>but</b> you <b>had</b> not got me with you then,” laughed Strider. “My cuts, short <b>or</b> long, don't go wrong.” He took a look up <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> Road. No one <b>was</b> <b>in</b> sight; <b>and</b> he led <b>the</b> way quickly down towards <b>the</b> wooded valley.
<br>   His plan, as far as they could understand <b>it</b> <b>without</b> knowing <b>the</b> country, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go towards Archet at first, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> bear right <b>and</b> pass <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> steer as straight as he could over <b>the</b> wild lands <b>to</b> Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, which further <b>on</b> bent southwards <b>to</b> avoid <b>the</b> Midgewater Marshes. But, <b>of</b> course, they would have <b>to</b> pass through <b>the</b> marshes themselves, <b>and</b> Strider's description <b>of</b> them <b>was</b> not encouraging.
<br>   However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meanwhile, walking <b>was</b> not unpleasant. Indeed, if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> not been for <b>the</b> disturbing events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night before, they would have enjoyed this pan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey better than any up <b>to</b> that time. The sun <b>was</b> shining, clear <b>but</b> not too hot. The woods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley were still leafy <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> colour, <b>and</b> seemed peaceful <b>and</b> wholesome. Strider guided them confidently among <b>the</b> many crossing paths, although left <b>to</b> themselves they would soon have been at a loss. He <b>was</b> taking a wandering course with many turns <b>and</b> doublings, <b>to</b> put off any pursuit.
<br>   “Bill Ferny will have watched where we left <b>the</b> Road, for certain,” he said; “though <b>I</b> don't think he will follow us himself. He knows <b>the</b> land round here well enough, <b>but</b> he knows he <b>is</b> not a match for me <b>in</b> a wood. It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he may tell others that <b>I</b> am afraid <b>of</b>. <b>I</b> don't suppose they are far away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much <b>the</b> better.”
<br>   Whether because <b>of</b> Strider's skill <b>or</b> for some other reason, they saw <b>no</b> sign <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> any other living thing all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox <b>and</b> a few squirrels. The next day they began <b>to</b> steer a steady course eastwards; <b>and</b> still all <b>was</b> quiet <b>and</b> peaceful. On <b>the</b> third day out from Bree they came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chetwood. The land <b>had</b> been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> they now entered a wide flat expanse <b>of</b> country, much more difficult <b>to</b> manage. They were far beyond <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bree-land, out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathless wilderness, <b>and</b> drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Midge-water Marshes.
<br>   The ground now became damp, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> places boggy <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there they came upon pools, <b>and</b> wide stretches <b>of</b> reeds <b>and</b> rushes filled with <b>the</b> warbling <b>of</b> little hidden birds. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick their way carefully <b>to</b> keep both dry-footed <b>and</b> <b>on</b> their proper course. At first they made fan-progress, <b>but</b> as they went <b>on</b>, their passage became slower <b>and</b> more dangerous. The marshes were bewildering <b>and</b> treacherous, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> permanent trail even for Rangers <b>to</b> find through their shifting quagmires. The flies began <b>to</b> torment them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> air <b>was</b> full <b>of</b> clouds <b>of</b> tiny midges that crept up their sleeves <b>and</b> breeches <b>and</b> <b>into</b> their hair.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am being eaten alive!” cried Pippin. “Midgewater! There are more midges than water!”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> they live <b>on</b> when they can't <b>get</b> hobbit?” asked Sam, scratching his neck.
<br>   They spent a miserable day <b>in</b> this lonely <b>and</b> unpleasant country. Their camping-place <b>was</b> damp, cold, <b>and</b> uncomfortable; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> biting insects would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting <b>the</b> reeds <b>and</b> tussocks that from <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> them were evil relatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cricket. There were thousands <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> they squeaked all round, neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all <b>the</b> night, until <b>the</b> hobbits were nearly frantic.
<br>   The next day, <b>the</b> fourth, <b>was</b> little better, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> night almost as comfortless. Though <b>the</b> Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) <b>had</b> been left behind, <b>the</b> midges still pursued them.
<br>   As Frodo lay, <b>tired</b> <b>but</b> unable <b>to</b> close his eyes, <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that far away there came a light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern sky: <b>it</b> flashed <b>and</b> faded many times. It <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> dawn, for that <b>was</b> still some hours off.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> light?” he said <b>to</b> Strider, who <b>had</b> risen, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> standing, gazing ahead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know,” Strider answered. “It <b>is</b> too distant <b>to</b> make out. It <b>is</b> like lightning that leaps up from <b>the</b> hill-tops.”
<br>   Frodo lay down again, <b>but</b> for a long while he could still see <b>the</b> white flashes, <b>and</b> against them <b>the</b> tall dark figure <b>of</b> Strider, standing silent <b>and</b> watchful. At last he passed <b>into</b> uneasy sleep.
<br>   They <b>had</b> not gone far <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifth day when they left <b>the</b> last straggling pools <b>and</b> reed-beds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marshes behind them. The land before them began steadily <b>to</b> rise again. Away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance eastward they could now see a line <b>of</b> hills. The highest <b>of</b> them <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>and</b> a little separated from <b>the</b> others. It <b>had</b> a conical top, slightly flattened at <b>the</b> summit.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> Weathertop,” said Strider. “The Old Road, which we have left far away <b>on</b> our right, runs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> passes not far from its foot. We might reach <b>it</b> <b>by</b> noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> suppose we <b>had</b> better <b>do</b> so.”
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> mean: when we <b>do</b> <b>get</b> there, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not certain <b>what</b> we shall find. It <b>is</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   “But surely we were hoping <b>to</b> find Gandalf there?”
<br>   “Yes; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hope <b>is</b> faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, <b>and</b> so he may not know <b>what</b> we are doing. And anyway, unless <b>by</b> luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; <b>it</b> will not be safe for him <b>or</b> for us <b>to</b> wait there long. If <b>the</b> Riders fail <b>to</b> find us <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness, they are likely <b>to</b> make for Weathertop themselves. It commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds <b>and</b> beasts <b>in</b> this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not all <b>the</b> birds are <b>to</b> be trusted, <b>and</b> there are other spies more evil than they are.”
<br>   The hobbits looked anxiously at <b>the</b> distant hills. Sam looked up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale sky, fearing <b>to</b> see hawks <b>or</b> eagles hovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. “You <b>do</b> make me feel uncomfortable <b>and</b> lonesome, Strider!” he said.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you advise us <b>to</b> <b>do</b>?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> think,” answered Strider slowly, as if he <b>was</b> not quite sure, “<b>I</b> think <b>the</b> best thing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> go as straight eastward from here as we can, <b>to</b> make for <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path <b>I</b> know that runs at their feet; <b>it</b> will bring us <b>to</b> Weathertop from <b>the</b> north <b>and</b> less openly. Then we shall see <b>what</b> we shall see.”
<br>   All that day they plodded along, until <b>the</b> cold <b>and</b> early evening came down. The land became drier <b>and</b> more barren; <b>but</b> mists <b>and</b> vapours lay behind them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping <b>and</b> wailing, until <b>the</b> round red sun sank slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> western shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soft light <b>of</b> sunset glancing through <b>the</b> cheerful windows <b>of</b> Bag End far away.
<br>   At <b>the</b> day's end they came <b>to</b> a stream that wandered down from <b>the</b> hills <b>to</b> lose itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stagnant marshland, <b>and</b> they went up along its banks while <b>the</b> light lasted. It <b>was</b> already night when at last they halted <b>and</b> made their camp under some stunted alder-trees <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream. Ahead there loomed now against <b>the</b> dusky sky <b>the</b> bleak <b>and</b> treeless backs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills. That night they set a watch, <b>and</b> Strider, <b>it</b> seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon <b>was</b> waxing, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early night-hours a cold grey light lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land.
<br>   Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There <b>was</b> a frost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they <b>had</b> <b>had</b> a night <b>of</b> unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used <b>to</b> much walking <b>on</b> short commons—shorter at any rate than <b>what</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire they would have <b>thought</b> barely enough <b>to</b> keep them <b>on</b> their legs. Pippin declared that Frodo <b>was</b> looking <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> hobbit that he <b>had</b> been.
<br>   “Very odd,” said Frodo, tightening his belt, “considering that there <b>is</b> actually a good deal less <b>of</b> me. <b>I</b> hope <b>the</b> thinning process will not go <b>on</b> indefinitely, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> shall become a wraith.”
<br>   “Do not speak <b>of</b> such things!” said Strider quickly, <b>and</b> with surprising earnestness.
<br>   The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost <b>to</b> a thousand feet, <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there falling again <b>to</b> low clefts <b>or</b> passes leading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern land beyond. Along <b>the</b> crest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge <b>the</b> hobbits could see <b>what</b> looked <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> green-grown walls <b>and</b> dikes, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clefts there still stood <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> old works <b>of</b> stone. By night they <b>had</b> reached <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westward slopes, <b>and</b> there they camped. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth <b>of</b> October, <b>and</b> they were six days out from Bree.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning they found, for <b>the</b> first time since they <b>had</b> left <b>the</b> Chetwood, a track plain <b>to</b> see. They turned right <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as <b>to</b> keep as much hidden as possible from <b>the</b> view, both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops above <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west. It dived <b>into</b> dells, <b>and</b> hugged steep banks; <b>and</b> where <b>it</b> passed over flatter <b>and</b> more open ground <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> <b>it</b> there were lines <b>of</b> large boulders <b>and</b> hewn stones that screened <b>the</b> travellers almost like a hedge.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder who made this path, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> for,” said Merry, as they walked along one <b>of</b> these avenues, where <b>the</b> stones were unusually large <b>and</b> closely set. “<b>I</b> am not sure that <b>I</b> like <b>it</b>: <b>it</b> has a—well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow <b>on</b> Weathertop?”
<br>   “No. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> barrow <b>on</b> Weathertop, nor <b>on</b> any <b>of</b> these hills,” answered Strider. “The Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West did not live here; though <b>in</b> their latter days they defended <b>the</b> hills for a while against <b>the</b> evil that came out <b>of</b> Angmar. This path <b>was</b> made <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> forts along <b>the</b> walls. But long before, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower <b>on</b> Weathertop, Amon S?l they called <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> burned <b>and</b> broken, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> remains <b>of</b> <b>it</b> now <b>but</b> a tumbled ring, like a rough crown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old hill's head. Yet <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> fair. It <b>is</b> told that Elendil stood there watching for <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Gil-galad out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Alliance.”
<br>   The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he <b>was</b> learned <b>in</b> old lore, as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild. “Who <b>was</b> Gil-galad?” asked Merry; <b>but</b> Strider did not answer, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> be lost <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>. Suddenly a low voice murmured:
<br>   
<br>Gil-galad <b>was</b> an Elven-king.
<br>Of him <b>the</b> harpers sadly sing:
<br><b>the</b> last whose realm <b>was</b> fair <b>and</b> free
<br>between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sea.
<br>
<br>His sword <b>was</b> long, his lance <b>was</b> keen,
<br>his shining helm afar <b>was</b> seen;
<br><b>the</b> countless stars <b>of</b> heaven's field
<br>were mirrored <b>in</b> his silver shield.
<br>
<br>But long ago he rode away,
<br><b>and</b> where he dwelleth none can say;
<br>for <b>into</b> darkness fell his star
<br><b>in</b> Mordor where <b>the</b> shadows are.
<br>   
<br>   The others turned <b>in</b> amazement, for <b>the</b> voice <b>was</b> Sam's.
<br>   “Don't stop!” said Merry.
<br>   “That's all <b>I</b> know,” stammered Sam, blushing. “<b>I</b> learned <b>it</b> from Mr. Bilbo when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a lad. He used <b>to</b> tell me tales like that, knowing how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always one for hearing about Elves. It <b>was</b> Mr. Bilbo as taught me my letters. He <b>was</b> mighty <b>book</b>-learned <b>was</b> dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote poetry. He wrote <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have just said.”
<br>   “He did not make <b>it</b> up,” said Strider. “It <b>is</b> pan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lay that <b>is</b> called The Fall <b>of</b> Gil-galad, which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have translated <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> never knew that.”
<br>   “There <b>was</b> a lot more,” said Sam, “all about Mordor. <b>I</b> didn't learn that part, <b>it</b> gave me <b>the</b> shivers <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should be going that way myself!”
<br>   “Going <b>to</b> Mordor!” cried Pippin. “<b>I</b> hope <b>it</b> won't come <b>to</b> that!”
<br>   “Do not speak that name so loudly!” said Strider.
<br>   It <b>was</b> already mid-day when they drew near <b>the</b> southern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> saw before them, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pale clear light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> October sun, a grey-green <b>bank</b>, leading up like a bridge <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northward slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill They decided <b>to</b> make for <b>the</b> top at <b>once</b>, while <b>the</b> daylight <b>was</b> broad Concealment <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer possible, <b>and</b> they could only hope that <b>no</b> enemy <b>or</b> spy <b>was</b> observing them. Nothing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be seen moving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill. If Gandalf <b>was</b> anywhere about, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> him.
<br>   On <b>the</b> western flank <b>of</b> Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> which there <b>was</b> a bowl-shaped dell with grassy sides. There they left Sam <b>and</b> Pippin with <b>the</b> pony <b>and</b> their packs <b>and</b> luggage. The other three went <b>on</b>. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached <b>the</b> crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill; Frodo <b>and</b> Merry followed, <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> breathless. The last slope <b>had</b> been steep <b>and</b> rocky.
<br>   On <b>the</b> top they found, as Strider <b>had</b> said, a wide ring <b>of</b> ancient stonework, now crumbling <b>or</b> covered with age-long grass. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre a cairn <b>of</b> broken stones <b>had</b> been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them <b>the</b> turf <b>was</b> burned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>and</b> all within <b>the</b> ring <b>the</b> grass <b>was</b> scorched <b>and</b> shrivelled, as if flames <b>had</b> swept <b>the</b> hill-top; <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any living thing.
<br>   Standing upon <b>the</b> rim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for <b>the</b> most pan <b>of</b> lands empty <b>and</b> featureless, except for patches <b>of</b> woodland away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, beyond which they caught here <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> glint <b>of</b> distant water. Beneath them <b>on</b> this southern side there ran like a ribbon <b>the</b> Old Road, coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> winding up <b>and</b> down, until <b>it</b> faded behind a ridge <b>of</b> dark land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. Nothing <b>was</b> moving <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Following its line eastward with their eyes they saw <b>the</b> Mountains: <b>the</b> nearer foothills were brown <b>and</b> sombre;
<br>   behind them stood taller shapes <b>of</b> grey, <b>and</b> behind those again were high white peaks glimmering among <b>the</b> clouds.
<br>   “Well, here we are!” said Merry. “And <b>very</b> cheerless <b>and</b> uninviting <b>it</b> looks! There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> water <b>and</b> <b>no</b> shelter. And <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Gandalf. But <b>I</b> don't blame him for not waiting—if he ever came here.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder,” said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. “Even if he <b>was</b> a day <b>or</b> two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride <b>very</b> swiftly when need presses.” Suddenly he stooped <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> stone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cairn; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flatter than <b>the</b> others, <b>and</b> whiter, as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> escaped <b>the</b> fire. He picked <b>it</b> up <b>and</b> examined <b>it</b>, turning <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his fingers. “This has been handled recently,” he said. “What <b>do</b> you think <b>of</b> these marks?”
<br>   On <b>the</b> flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches:  “There seems <b>to</b> he a stroke, a dot, <b>and</b> three more strokes,” he said.
<br>   “The stroke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left might be a G-rune with thin branches,” said Strider. “It might be a sign left <b>by</b> Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The scratches are fine, <b>and</b> they certainly look fresh. But <b>the</b> marks might mean something quite different, <b>and</b> have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us. Rangers <b>use</b> runes, <b>and</b> they come here sometimes.”
<br>   “What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?” asked Merry
<br>   “<b>I</b> should say,” answered Strider, “that they stood for G3, <b>and</b> were a sign that Gandalf <b>was</b> here <b>on</b> October <b>the</b> third: that <b>is</b> three days ago now. It would also show that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a hurry <b>and</b> danger <b>was</b> at hand, so that he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time <b>or</b> did not dare <b>to</b> write anything longer <b>or</b> plainer. If that <b>is</b> so, we must be wary.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish we could feel sure that he made <b>the</b> marks, whatever they may mean,” said Frodo “It would be a great comfort <b>to</b> know that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way, <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> us <b>or</b> behind us.”
<br>   “Perhaps,” said Strider. “For myself, <b>I</b> believe that he <b>was</b> here, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> danger. There have been scorching flames here; <b>and</b> now <b>the</b> light that we saw three nights ago <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern sky comes back <b>to</b> my mind. <b>I</b> guess that he <b>was</b> attacked <b>on</b> this hill-top, <b>but</b> with <b>what</b> result <b>I</b> cannot tell. He <b>is</b> here <b>no</b> longer, <b>and</b> we must now look after ourselves <b>and</b> make our own way <b>to</b> Rivendell, as best we can”
<br>   “How far <b>is</b> Rivendell?” asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild <b>and</b> wide from Weathertop.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know if <b>the</b> Road has ever been measured <b>in</b> miles beyond <b>the</b> Forsaken Inn, a day's journey east <b>of</b> Bree,” answered Strider. “Some say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so far, <b>and</b> some say otherwise. It <b>is</b> a strange road, <b>and</b> folk are glad <b>to</b> reach their journey's end, whether <b>the</b> time <b>is</b> long <b>or</b> short. But <b>I</b> know how long <b>it</b> would take me <b>on</b> my own feet, with fair weather <b>and</b> <b>no</b> ill fortune twelve days from here <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen, where <b>the</b> Road crosses <b>the</b> Loudwater that runs out <b>of</b> Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight's journey before us, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think we shall be able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Road.”
<br>   “A fortnight!” said Frodo. “A lot may happen <b>in</b> that time.”
<br>   “It may,” said Strider.
<br>   They stood for a while silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top, near its southward edge. In that lonely place Frodo for <b>the</b> first time fully realized his homelessness <b>and</b> danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune <b>had</b> left him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quiet <b>and</b> beloved Shire. He stared down at <b>the</b> hateful Road, leading back westward—<b>to</b> his home. Suddenly he <b>was</b> aware that two black specks were moving slowly along <b>it</b>, going westward; <b>and</b> looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward <b>to</b> meet them. He gave a cry <b>and</b> clutched Strider's arm.
<br>   “Look,” he said, pointing downwards.
<br>   At <b>once</b> Strider flung himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground behind <b>the</b> ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?” he whispered.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> fear <b>the</b> worst,” answered Strider.
<br>   Slowly they crawled up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring again, <b>and</b> peered through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer bright, for <b>the</b> clear morning <b>had</b> faded, <b>and</b> clouds creeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East <b>had</b> now overtaken <b>the</b> sun, as <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> go down. They could all see <b>the</b> black specks, <b>but</b> neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road beyond <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill.
<br>   “Yes,” said Strider, whose keener sight left him <b>in</b> <b>no</b> doubt. “The enemy <b>is</b> here!”
<br>   Hastily they crept away <b>and</b> slipped down <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>to</b> find their companions.
<br>   Sam <b>and</b> Peregrin <b>had</b> not been idle. They <b>had</b> explored <b>the</b> small dell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring <b>of</b> clear water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hillside, <b>and</b> near <b>it</b> footprints not more than a day <b>or</b> two old. In <b>the</b> dell itself they found recent traces <b>of</b> a fire, <b>and</b> other signs <b>of</b> a hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell nearest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store <b>of</b> firewood neatly stacked.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder if old Gandalf has been here,” he said <b>to</b> Pippin. “Whoever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> put this stuff here meant <b>to</b> come back <b>it</b> seems.”
<br>   Strider <b>was</b> greatly interested <b>in</b> these discoveries. “<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> waited <b>and</b> explored <b>the</b> ground down here myself,” he said, hurrying off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spring <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> footprints.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> just as <b>I</b> feared,” he said, when he came back. “Sam <b>and</b> Pippin have trampled <b>the</b> soft ground, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marks are spoilt <b>or</b> confused. Rangers have been here lately. It <b>is</b> they who left <b>the</b> firewood behind. But there are also several newer tracks that were not made <b>by</b> Rangers. At least one set <b>was</b> made, only a day <b>or</b> two ago, <b>by</b> heavy boots. At least one. <b>I</b> cannot now be certain, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think there were many booted feet.” He paused <b>and</b> stood <b>in</b> anxious <b>thought</b>.
<br>   Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits saw <b>in</b> his mind a vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloaked <b>and</b> booted Riders. If <b>the</b> horsemen <b>had</b> already found <b>the</b> dell, <b>the</b> sooner Strider led them somewhere else <b>the</b> better. Sam viewed <b>the</b> hollow with great dislike, now that he <b>had</b> heard news <b>of</b> their enemies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road, only a few miles away.
<br>   “Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?” he asked impatiently. “It <b>is</b> getting late, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't like this hole: <b>it</b> makes my heart sink somehow.”
<br>   “Yes, we certainly must decide <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at <b>once</b>,” answered Strider, looking up <b>and</b> considering <b>the</b> time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weather. “Well, Sam,” he said at last, “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like this place either; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> cannot think <b>of</b> anywhere better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out <b>of</b> sight for <b>the</b> moment, <b>and</b> if we moved we should be much more likely <b>to</b> be seen <b>by</b> spies. All we could <b>do</b> would be <b>to</b> go right out <b>of</b> our way back north <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> hills, where <b>the</b> land <b>is</b> all much <b>the</b> same as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> here. The Road <b>is</b> watched, <b>but</b> we should have <b>to</b> cross <b>it</b>, if we tried <b>to</b> take cover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thickets away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. On <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road beyond <b>the</b> hills <b>the</b> country <b>is</b> bare <b>and</b> flat for miles.”
<br>   “Can <b>the</b> Riders see?” asked Merry. “<b>I</b> mean, they seem usually <b>to</b> have used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling <b>is</b> <b>the</b> right word, at least <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you saw them down below; <b>and</b> now you talk <b>of</b> being seen, if we move.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> too careless <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top,” answered Strider. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> anxious <b>to</b> find some sign <b>of</b> Gandalf; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a mistake for three <b>of</b> us <b>to</b> go up <b>and</b> stand there so long. For <b>the</b> black horses can see, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Riders can <b>use</b> men <b>and</b> other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They themselves <b>do</b> not see <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> light as we <b>do</b>, <b>but</b> our shapes cast shadows <b>in</b> their minds, which only <b>the</b> noon sun destroys; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark they perceive many signs <b>and</b> forms that are hidden from us: then they are most <b>to</b> be feared. And at all times they smell <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> living things, desiring <b>and</b> hating <b>it</b>. Senses, too, there are other than sight <b>or</b> smell. We can feel their presence—<b>it</b> troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, <b>and</b> before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,” he added, <b>and</b> his voice sank <b>to</b> a whisper, “<b>the</b> Ring draws them.”
<br>   “Is there <b>no</b> escape then?” said Frodo, looking round wildly. “If <b>I</b> move <b>I</b> shall be seen <b>and</b> hunted! If <b>I</b> stay, <b>I</b> shall draw them <b>to</b> me!”
<br>   Strider laid his hand <b>on</b> his shoulder. “There <b>is</b> still hope,” he said. “You are not alone. Let us take this wood that <b>is</b> set ready for <b>the</b> fire as a sign. There <b>is</b> little shelter <b>or</b> defence here, <b>but</b> fire shall serve for both. Sauron can put fire <b>to</b> his evil uses, as he can all things, <b>but</b> these Riders <b>do</b> not love <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> fear those who wield <b>it</b>. Fire <b>is</b> our friend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness.”
<br>   “Maybe,” muttered Sam. “It <b>is</b> also as good a way <b>of</b> saying “here we are” as <b>I</b> can think <b>of</b>, bar shouting.”
<br>   Down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lowest <b>and</b> most sheltered corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they lit a fire, <b>and</b> prepared a meal. The shades <b>of</b> evening began <b>to</b> fall, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> grew cold. They were suddenly aware <b>of</b> great hunger, for they <b>had</b> not eaten anything since breakfast; <b>but</b> they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty <b>of</b> all save birds <b>and</b> beasts, unfriendly places deserted <b>by</b> all <b>the</b> races <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Rangers passed at times beyond <b>the</b> hills, <b>but</b> they were few <b>and</b> did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains. Only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Road would travellers be found, most often dwarves, hurrying along <b>on</b> business <b>of</b> their own, <b>and</b> with <b>no</b> help <b>and</b> few words <b>to</b> spare for strangers.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't see how our food can be made <b>to</b> last,” said Frodo. “We have been careful enough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few days, <b>and</b> this supper <b>is</b> <b>no</b> feast; <b>but</b> we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> perhaps more.”
<br>   “There <b>is</b> food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild,” said Strider; “berry, root, <b>and</b> herb; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid <b>of</b> starving before winter comes. But gathering <b>and</b> catching food <b>is</b> long <b>and</b> weary work, <b>and</b> we need haste. So tighten your belts, <b>and</b> think with hope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tables <b>of</b> Elrond's house!”
<br>   The cold increased as darkness came <b>on</b>. Peering out from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they could see <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a grey land now vanishing quickly <b>into</b> shadow. The sky above <b>had</b> cleared again <b>and</b> <b>was</b> slowly filled with twinkling stars. Frodo <b>and</b> his companions huddled round <b>the</b> fire, wrapped <b>in</b> every garment <b>and</b> blanket they possessed; <b>but</b> Strider <b>was</b> content with a single cloak, <b>and</b> sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.
<br>   As night fell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire began <b>to</b> shine out brightly he began <b>to</b> tell them tales <b>to</b> keep their minds from fear. He knew many histories <b>and</b> legends <b>of</b> long ago, <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> <b>the</b> good <b>and</b> evil deeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days. They wondered how old he <b>was</b>, <b>and</b> where he <b>had</b> learned all this lore.
<br>   “Tell us <b>of</b> Gil-galad,” said Merry suddenly, when he paused at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a story <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-Kingdoms. “Do you know any more <b>of</b> that old lay that you spoke <b>of</b>?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> indeed,” answered Strider. “So also does Frodo, for <b>it</b> concerns us closely.” Merry <b>and</b> Pippin looked at Frodo, who <b>was</b> staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fire.
<br>   “<b>I</b> know only <b>the</b> little that Gandalf has told me,” said Frodo slowly. “Gil-galad <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Elf-kings <b>of</b> Middle-earth. Gil-galad <b>is</b> Starlight <b>in</b> their tongue. With Elendil, <b>the</b> Elf-friend, he went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b>—”
<br>   “No!” said Strider interrupting, “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that tale should be told now with <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy at hand. If we win through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, you may hear <b>it</b> there, told <b>in</b> full.”
<br>   “Then tell us some other tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old days,” begged Sam; “a tale about <b>the</b> Elves before <b>the</b> fading time. <b>I</b> would dearly like <b>to</b> hear more about Elves; <b>the</b> dark seems <b>to</b> press round so close.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will tell you <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Tin?viel,” said Strider, “<b>in</b> brief—for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a long tale <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> end <b>is</b> not known; <b>and</b> there are none now, except Elrond, that remember <b>it</b> aright as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> told <b>of</b> old. It <b>is</b> a fair tale, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sad, as are all <b>the</b> tales <b>of</b> Middle-earth, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> may lift up your hearts.” He <b>was</b> silent for some time, <b>and</b> then he began not <b>to</b> speak <b>but</b> <b>to</b> chant softly:
<br>   
<br>The leaves were long, <b>the</b> grass <b>was</b> green,
<br>The hemlock-umbels tall <b>and</b> fair,
<br>And <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glade a light <b>was</b> seen
<br>Of stars <b>in</b> shadow shimmering.
<br>Tin?viel <b>was</b> dancing there
<br>To music <b>of</b> a pipe unseen,
<br>And light <b>of</b> stars <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hair,
<br>And <b>in</b> <b>her</b> raiment glimmering.
<br>
<br>There Beren came from mountains cold,
<br>And lost he wandered under leaves,
<br>And where <b>the</b> Elven-river rolled
<br>He walked alone <b>and</b> sorrowing.
<br>He peered between <b>the</b> hemlock-leaves
<br>And saw <b>in</b> wander flowers <b>of</b> gold
<br>Upon <b>her</b> mantle <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sleeves,
<br>And <b>her</b> hair like shadow following.
<br>
<br>Enchantment healed his weary feet
<br>That over hills were doomed <b>to</b> roam;
<br>And forth he hastened, strong <b>and</b> fleet,
<br>And grasped at moonbeams glistening.
<br>Through woven woods <b>in</b> Elvenhome
<br>She tightly fled <b>on</b> dancing feet,
<br>And left him lonely still <b>to</b> roam
<br>In <b>the</b> silent forest listening.
<br>
<br>He heard there oft <b>the</b> flying sound
<br>Of feet as light as linden-leaves,
<br>Or music welling underground,
<br>In hidden hollows quavering.
<br>Now withered lay <b>the</b> hemlock-sheaves,
<br>And one <b>by</b> one with sighing sound
<br>Whispering fell <b>the</b> beechen leaves
<br>In <b>the</b> wintry woodland wavering.
<br>
<br>He sought <b>her</b> ever, wandering far
<br>Where leaves <b>of</b> years were thickly strewn,
<br>By light <b>of</b> moon <b>and</b> ray <b>of</b> star
<br>In frosty heavens shivering.
<br>Her mantle glinted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moon,
<br>As <b>on</b> a hill-top high <b>and</b> far
<br>She danced, <b>and</b> at <b>her</b> feet <b>was</b> strewn
<br>A mist <b>of</b> silver quivering.
<br>
<br>When winter passed, <b>she</b> came again,
<br>And <b>her</b> song released <b>the</b> sudden spring,
<br>Like rising lark, <b>and</b> falling rain,
<br>And melting water bubbling.
<br>He saw <b>the</b> elven-flowers spring
<br>About <b>her</b> feet, <b>and</b> healed again
<br>He longed <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> dance <b>and</b> sing
<br>Upon <b>the</b> grass untroubling.
<br>
<br>Again <b>she</b> fled, <b>but</b> swift he came.
<br>Tin?viel! Tin?viel!
<br>He called <b>her</b> <b>by</b> <b>her</b> elvish name;
<br>And there <b>she</b> halted listening.
<br>One moment stood <b>she</b>, <b>and</b> a spell
<br>His voice laid <b>on</b> <b>her</b>: Beren came,
<br>And doom fell <b>on</b> Tin?viel
<br>That <b>in</b> his arms lay glistening.
<br>
<br>As Beren looked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes
<br>Within <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair,
<br>The trembling starlight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skies
<br>He saw there mirrored shimmering.
<br>Tin?viel <b>the</b> elven-fair,
<br>Immortal maiden elven-wise,
<br>About him cast <b>her</b> shadowy hair
<br>And arms like silver glimmering.
<br>
<br>Long <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way that fate them bore,
<br>O'er stony mountains cold <b>and</b> grey,
<br>Through halls <b>of</b> iron <b>and</b> darkling door,
<br>And woods <b>of</b> nightshade morrowless.
<br>The Sundering Seas between them lay,
<br>And yet at last they met <b>once</b> more,
<br>And long ago they passed away
<br>In <b>the</b> forest singing sorrowless.
<br>   
<br>   Strider sighed <b>and</b> paused before he spoke again. “That <b>is</b> a song,” he said, “<b>in</b> <b>the</b> mode that <b>is</b> called ann-thennath among <b>the</b> Elves, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> hard <b>to</b> render <b>in</b> our Common Speech, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> <b>but</b> a rough echo <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. It tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meeting <b>of</b> Beren son <b>of</b> Barahir <b>and</b> L?thien Tin?viel. Beren <b>was</b> a mortal man, <b>but</b> L?thien <b>was</b> <b>the</b> daughter <b>of</b> Thingol, a King <b>of</b> Elves upon Middle-earth when <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> young; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fairest maiden that has ever been among all <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> this world. As <b>the</b> stars above <b>the</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern lands <b>was</b> <b>her</b> loveliness, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face <b>was</b> a shining light. In those days <b>the</b> Great Enemy, <b>of</b> whom Sauron <b>of</b> Mordor <b>was</b> <b>but</b> a servant, dwelt <b>in</b> Angband <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West coming back <b>to</b> Middle-earth made war upon him <b>to</b> regain <b>the</b> Silmarils which he <b>had</b> stolen; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fathers <b>of</b> Men aided <b>the</b> Elves. But <b>the</b> Enemy <b>was</b> victorious <b>and</b> Barahir <b>was</b> slain, <b>and</b> Beren escaping through great peril came over <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Terror <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hidden Kingdom <b>of</b> Thingol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forest <b>of</b> Neldoreth. There he beheld L?thien singing <b>and</b> dancing <b>in</b> a glade beside <b>the</b> enchanted river Esgalduin; <b>and</b> he named <b>her</b> Tin?viel, that <b>is</b> Nightingale <b>in</b> <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, <b>and</b> they were parted long. Tin?viel rescued Beren from <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> Sauron, <b>and</b> together they passed through great dangers, <b>and</b> cast down even <b>the</b> Great Enemy from his throne, <b>and</b> took from his iron crown one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three Silmarils, brightest <b>of</b> all jewels, <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> bride-price <b>of</b> L?thien <b>to</b> Thingol <b>her</b> father. Yet at <b>the</b> last Beren <b>was</b> slain <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wolf that came from <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Angband, <b>and</b> he died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> Tin?viel. But <b>she</b> chose mortality, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> die from <b>the</b> world, so that <b>she</b> might follow him; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sung that they met again beyond <b>the</b> Sundering Seas, <b>and</b> after a brief time walking alive <b>once</b> more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green woods, together they passed, long ago, beyond <b>the</b> confines <b>of</b> this world. So <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that L?thien Tin?viel alone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-kindred has died indeed <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> they have lost <b>her</b> whom they most loved. But from <b>her</b> <b>the</b> lineage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-lords <b>of</b> old descended among Men. There live still those <b>of</b> whom L?thien <b>was</b> <b>the</b> foremother, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said that <b>her</b> line shall never fail. Elrond <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>is</b> <b>of</b> that Kin. For <b>of</b> Beren <b>and</b> L?thien <b>was</b> born Dior Thingol's heir; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> him Elwing <b>the</b> White whom E?rendil wedded, he that sailed his ship out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>into</b> <b>the</b> seas <b>of</b> heaven with <b>the</b> Silmaril upon his brow. And <b>of</b> E?rendil came <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> N?menor, that <b>is</b> Westernesse.”
<br>   As Strider <b>was</b> speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> red glow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood-fire. His eyes shone, <b>and</b> his voice <b>was</b> rich <b>and</b> deep. Above him <b>was</b> a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over <b>the</b> crown <b>of</b> Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon <b>was</b> climbing slowly above <b>the</b> hill that overshadowed them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stars above <b>the</b> hill-top faded.
<br>   The story ended. The hobbits moved <b>and</b> stretched. “Look!” said Merry. “The Moon <b>is</b> rising: <b>it</b> must be getting late.”
<br>   The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill something small <b>and</b> dark against <b>the</b> glimmer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moonrise. It <b>was</b> perhaps only a large stone <b>or</b> jutting rock shown up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pale light.
<br>   Sam <b>and</b> Merry got up <b>and</b> walked away from <b>the</b> fire. Frodo <b>and</b> Pippin remained seated <b>in</b> silence. Strider <b>was</b> watching <b>the</b> moonlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill intently. All seemed quiet <b>and</b> still, <b>but</b> Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that Strider <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer speaking. He huddled closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire. At that moment Sam came running back from <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” he said, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> suddenly felt afraid. <b>I</b> durstn't go outside this dell for any money; <b>I</b> felt that something <b>was</b> creeping up <b>the</b> slope.”
<br>   “Did you see anything?” asked Frodo, springing <b>to</b> his feet.
<br>   “No, sir. <b>I</b> saw <b>nothing</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't stop <b>to</b> look.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> saw something,” said Merry; “<b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did—away westwards where <b>the</b> moonlight <b>was</b> falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flats beyond <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> there were two <b>or</b> three black shapes. They seemed <b>to</b> be moving this way.”
<br>   “Keep close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire, with your faces outward!” cried Strider. “Get some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longer sticks ready <b>in</b> your hands!”
<br>   For a breathless time they sat there, silent <b>and</b> alert, with their backs turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wood-fire, each gazing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound <b>or</b> movement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break <b>the</b> silence: he longed <b>to</b> shout out aloud.
<br>   “Hush!” whispered Strider. “What's that?” gasped Pippin at <b>the</b> same moment.
<br>   Over <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little dell, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side away from <b>the</b> hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow <b>or</b> more than one. They strained their eyes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows seemed <b>to</b> grow. Soon there could be <b>no</b> doubt:
<br>   three <b>or</b> four tall black figures were standing there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slope, looking down <b>on</b> them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep shade behind them. Frodo <b>thought</b> that he heard a faint hiss as <b>of</b> venomous breath <b>and</b> felt a thin piercing chill. Then <b>the</b> shapes slowly advanced.
<br>   Terror overcame Pippin <b>and</b> Merry, <b>and</b> they threw themselves flat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Sam shrank <b>to</b> Frodo's side. Frodo <b>was</b> hardly less terrified than his companions; he <b>was</b> quaking as if he <b>was</b> bitter cold, <b>but</b> his terror <b>was</b> swallowed up <b>in</b> a sudden temptation <b>to</b> put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring. The desire <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this laid hold <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> he could think <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else. He did not forget <b>the</b> Barrow, nor <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> Gandalf; <b>but</b> something seemed <b>to</b> be compelling him <b>to</b> disregard all warnings, <b>and</b> he longed <b>to</b> yield. Not with <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> escape, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> doing anything, either good <b>or</b> bad: he simply felt that he must take <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master <b>was</b> <b>in</b> some great trouble, <b>but</b> he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes <b>and</b> struggled for a while; <b>but</b> resistance became unbearable, <b>and</b> at last he slowly drew out <b>the</b> chain, <b>and</b> slipped <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forefinger <b>of</b> his left hand.
<br>   Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim <b>and</b> dark, <b>the</b> shapes became terribly clear. He <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> see beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen <b>and</b> merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms <b>of</b> silver; <b>in</b> their haggard hands were swords <b>of</b> steel. Their eyes fell <b>on</b> him <b>and</b> pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own sword, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>it</b> flickered red, as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a firebrand. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figures halted. The third <b>was</b> taller than <b>the</b> others: his hair <b>was</b> long <b>and</b> gleaming <b>and</b> <b>on</b> his helm <b>was</b> a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other a knife; both <b>the</b> knife <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand that held <b>it</b> glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward <b>and</b> bore down <b>on</b> Frodo.
<br>   At that moment Frodo threw himself forward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> he heard himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At <b>the</b> same time he struck at <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> his enemy. A shrill cry rang out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night; <b>and</b> he felt a pain like a dart <b>of</b> poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse <b>of</b> Strider leaping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness with a flaming brand <b>of</b> wood <b>in</b> either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped <b>the</b> Ring from his finger <b>and</b> closed his right hand tight upon <b>it</b>.
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 12
<br>FLIGHT TO <b>THE</b> FORD
<br>
<br>   When Frodo came <b>to</b> himself he <b>was</b> still clutching <b>the</b> Ring desperately. He <b>was</b> lying <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, which <b>was</b> now piled high <b>and</b> burning brightly. His three companions were bending over him. “What has happened? Where <b>is</b> <b>the</b> pale king?” he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed <b>to</b> hear him speak <b>to</b> answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered from Sam that they <b>had</b> seen <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly <b>to</b> his horror Sam found that his master <b>had</b> vanished; <b>and</b> at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, <b>and</b> he fell. He heard Frodo's voice, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> come from a great distance, <b>or</b> from under <b>the</b> earth, crying out strange words. They saw <b>nothing</b> more, until they stumbled over <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them <b>to</b> pick him up <b>and</b> lay him near <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> then he disappeared. That <b>was</b> now a good while ago.
<br>   Sam plainly <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> have doubts again about Strider; <b>but</b> while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows. They started, <b>and</b> Sam drew his sword <b>and</b> stood over Frodo; <b>but</b> Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am not a Black Rider, Sam,” he said gently, “nor <b>in</b> league with them. <b>I</b> have been trying <b>to</b> discover something <b>of</b> their movements; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have found <b>nothing</b>. <b>I</b> cannot think why they have gone <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not attack again. But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> feeling <b>of</b> their presence anywhere at hand.”
<br>   When he heard <b>what</b> Frodo <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell, he became full <b>of</b> concern, <b>and</b> shook his head <b>and</b> sighed. Then he ordered Pippin <b>and</b> Merry <b>to</b> heat as much water as they could <b>in</b> their small kettles, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> bathe <b>the</b> wound with <b>it</b>. “Keep <b>the</b> fire going well, <b>and</b> keep Frodo warm!” he said. Then he got up <b>and</b> walked away, <b>and</b> called Sam <b>to</b> him. “<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> understand things better now,” he said <b>in</b> a low voice. “There seem only <b>to</b> have been five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy. Why they were not all here, <b>I</b> don't know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't think they expected <b>to</b> be resisted. They have drawn off for <b>the</b> time being. But not far, <b>I</b> fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only waiting, because they think that their purpose <b>is</b> almost accomplished, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> Ring cannot fly much further. <b>I</b> fear, Sam, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him <b>to</b> their will. We shall see!” Sam choked with tears. “Don't despair!” said Strider. “You must trust me now. Your Frodo <b>is</b> made <b>of</b> sterner stuff than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> guessed, though Gandalf hinted that <b>it</b> might prove so. He <b>is</b> not slain, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think he will resist <b>the</b> evil power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wound longer than his enemies expect. <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> all <b>I</b> can <b>to</b> help <b>and</b> heal him. Guard him well, while <b>I</b> am away!” He hurried off <b>and</b> disappeared again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   Frodo dozed, though <b>the</b> pain <b>of</b> his wound <b>was</b> slowly growing, <b>and</b> a deadly chill <b>was</b> spreading from his shoulder <b>to</b> his arm <b>and</b> side. His friends watched over him, warming him, <b>and</b> bathing his wound. The night passed slowly <b>and</b> wearily. Dawn <b>was</b> growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dell <b>was</b> filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.
<br>   “Look!” he cried; <b>and</b> stooping he lifted from <b>the</b> ground a black cloak that <b>had</b> lain there hidden <b>by</b> <b>the</b> darkness. A foot above <b>the</b> lower hem there <b>was</b> a slash. “This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> stroke <b>of</b> Frodo's sword,” he said. “The only hurt that <b>it</b> did <b>to</b> his enemy, <b>I</b> fear; for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unharmed, <b>but</b> all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly <b>to</b> him <b>was</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Elbereth.”
<br>   “And more deadly <b>to</b> Frodo <b>was</b> this!” He stooped again <b>and</b> lifted up a long thin knife. There <b>was</b> a cold gleam <b>in</b> <b>it</b>. As Strider raised <b>it</b> they saw that near <b>the</b> end its edge <b>was</b> notched <b>and</b> <b>the</b> point <b>was</b> broken off. But even as he held <b>it</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing light, they gazed <b>in</b> astonishment, for <b>the</b> blade seemed <b>to</b> melt, <b>and</b> vanished like a smoke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, leaving only <b>the</b> hilt <b>in</b> Strider's hand. “Alas!” he cried. “It <b>was</b> this accursed knife that gave <b>the</b> wound. Few now have <b>the</b> skill <b>in</b> healing <b>to</b> match such evil weapons. But <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can.”
<br>   He sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> taking <b>the</b> dagger-hilt laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his knees, <b>and</b> he sang over <b>it</b> a slow song <b>in</b> a strange tongue. Then setting <b>it</b> aside, he turned <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> <b>in</b> a soft tone spoke words <b>the</b> others could not catch. From <b>the</b> pouch at his belt he drew out <b>the</b> long leaves <b>of</b> a plant.
<br>   “These leaves,” he said, “<b>I</b> have walked far <b>to</b> find; for this plant does not grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bare hills; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thickets away south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road <b>I</b> found <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>by</b> <b>the</b> scent <b>of</b> its leaves.” He crushed a leaf <b>in</b> his fingers, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> gave out a sweet <b>and</b> pungent fragrance. “It <b>is</b> fortunate that <b>I</b> could find <b>it</b>, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a healing plant that <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West brought <b>to</b> Middle-earth. Athelas they named <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> grows now sparsely <b>and</b> only near places where they dwelt <b>or</b> camped <b>of</b> old; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not known <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, except <b>to</b> some <b>of</b> those who wander <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild. It has great virtues, <b>but</b> over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.”
<br>   He threw <b>the</b> leaves <b>into</b> boiling water <b>and</b> bathed Frodo's shoulder. The fragrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steam <b>was</b> refreshing, <b>and</b> those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed <b>and</b> cleared. The herb <b>had</b> also some power over <b>the</b> wound, for Frodo felt <b>the</b> pain <b>and</b> also <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> frozen cold lessen <b>in</b> his side; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> life did not return <b>to</b> his arm, <b>and</b> he could not raise <b>or</b> <b>use</b> his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, <b>and</b> reproached himself for weakness <b>of</b> will; for he now perceived that <b>in</b> putting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring he obeyed not his own desire <b>but</b> <b>the</b> commanding wish <b>of</b> his enemies. He wondered if he would remain maimed for life, <b>and</b> how they would now manage <b>to</b> continue their journey. He fell too weak <b>to</b> stand.
<br>   The others were discussing this <b>very</b> question. They quickly decided <b>to</b> leave Weathertop as soon as possible. “<b>I</b> think now,” said Strider, “that <b>the</b> enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been forced <b>to</b> ride away, <b>and</b> he will not return. In any case we are <b>in</b> great peril here after dark, since <b>the</b> attack <b>of</b> last night, <b>and</b> we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.”
<br>   As soon as <b>the</b> daylight <b>was</b> full, they <b>had</b> some hurried food <b>and</b> packed. It <b>was</b> impossible for Frodo <b>to</b> walk, so they divided <b>the</b> greater part <b>of</b> their baggage among <b>the</b> four <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> put Frodo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pony. In <b>the</b> last few days <b>the</b> poor beast <b>had</b> improved wonderfully; <b>it</b> already seemed fatter <b>and</b> stronger, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> show an affection for its new masters, especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been <b>very</b> hard for <b>the</b> journey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild <b>to</b> seem so much better than its former life.
<br>   They started off <b>in</b> a southerly direction. This would mean crossing <b>the</b> Road, <b>but</b>. <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> quickest way <b>to</b> more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection for them all. It <b>was</b> also his plan <b>to</b> shorten their journey <b>by</b> cutting across another great loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road: east beyond Weathertop <b>it</b> changed its course <b>and</b> took a wide bend northwards.
<br>   They made their way slowly <b>and</b> cautiously round <b>the</b> south-western slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> came <b>in</b> a little while <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling <b>and</b> a cold voice answering. Trembling they sprang forward, <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped away southwards, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> wild <b>and</b> pathless; bushes <b>and</b> stunted trees grew <b>in</b> dense patches with wide barren spaces <b>in</b> between. The grass <b>was</b> scanty, coarse, <b>and</b> grey; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thickets were faded <b>and</b> falling. It <b>was</b> a cheerless land, <b>and</b> their journey <b>was</b> slow <b>and</b> gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart <b>was</b> grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, <b>and</b> their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> heavy-hearted.
<br>   Before <b>the</b> first day's march <b>was</b> over Frodo's pain began <b>to</b> grow again, <b>but</b> he did not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> for a long time. Four days passed, <b>without</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>or</b> <b>the</b> scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, <b>and</b> before them <b>the</b> distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they <b>had</b> seen <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sign that <b>the</b> enemy <b>had</b> marked their flight <b>or</b> followed them. They dreaded <b>the</b> dark hours, <b>and</b> kept watch <b>in</b> pairs <b>by</b> night, expecting at any time <b>to</b> see black shapes stalking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grey night, dimly lit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cloud-veiled moon; <b>but</b> they saw <b>nothing</b>, <b>and</b> heard <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sigh <b>of</b> withered leaves <b>and</b> grass. Not <b>once</b> did they feel <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> present evil that <b>had</b> assailed them before <b>the</b> attack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dell. It seemed too much <b>to</b> hope that <b>the</b> Riders <b>had</b> already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting <b>to</b> make some ambush <b>in</b> a narrow place?
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth day <b>the</b> ground began <b>once</b> more <b>to</b> rise slowly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wide shallow valley <b>into</b> which they <b>had</b> descended. Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sixth day they reached <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a long slow-climbing slope, <b>and</b> saw far ahead a huddle <b>of</b> wooded hills. Away below them they could see <b>the</b> Road sweeping round <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their right a grey river gleamed pale <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thin sunshine. In <b>the</b> distance they glimpsed yet another river <b>in</b> a stony valley half-veiled <b>in</b> mist.
<br>   "<b>I</b> am afraid we must go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road here for a while,” said Strider. “We have now come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Hoarwell, that <b>the</b> Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, <b>the</b> troll-fells north <b>of</b> Rivendell, <b>and</b> joins <b>the</b> Loudwater away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South. Some call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood after that. It <b>is</b> a great water before <b>it</b> finds <b>the</b> Sea. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> way over <b>it</b> below its sources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, except <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Last Bridge <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> Road crosses.”
<br>   “What <b>is</b> that other river we can see far away there?” asked Merry.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> Loudwater, <b>the</b> Bruinen <b>of</b> Rivendell,” answered Strider. “The Road runs along <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills for many miles from <b>the</b> Bridge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen. But <b>I</b> have not yet <b>thought</b> how we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we <b>do</b> not find <b>the</b> Last Bridge held against us.”
<br>   Next day, early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, they came down again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. Sam <b>and</b> Strider went forward, <b>but</b> they found <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any travellers <b>or</b> riders. Here under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills there <b>had</b> been some rain. Strider judged that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> fallen two days before, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> washed away all footprints. No horseman <b>had</b> passed since then, as far as he could see.
<br>   They hurried along with all <b>the</b> speed they could make, <b>and</b> after a mile <b>or</b> two they saw <b>the</b> Last Bridge ahead, at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a short steep slope. They dreaded <b>to</b> see black figures waiting there, <b>but</b> they saw none. Strider made them take cover <b>in</b> a thicket at <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, while he went forward <b>to</b> explore.
<br>   Before long he came hurrying back. “<b>I</b> can see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> wonder <b>very</b> much <b>what</b> that means. But <b>I</b> have found something <b>very</b> strange.”
<br>   He held out his hand, <b>and</b> showed a single pale-green jewel. “<b>I</b> found <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mud <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bridge,” he said. “It <b>is</b> a beryl, an elf-stone. Whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> set there, <b>or</b> let fall <b>by</b> chance, <b>I</b> cannot say; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> brings hope <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> will take <b>it</b> as a sign that we may pass <b>the</b> Bridge; <b>but</b> beyond that <b>I</b> dare not keep <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>without</b> some clearer token.”
<br>   At <b>once</b> they went <b>on</b> again. They crossed <b>the</b> Bridge <b>in</b> safety, hearing <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> water swirling against its three great arches. A mile further <b>on</b> they came <b>to</b> a narrow ravine that led away northwards through <b>the</b> steep lands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. Here Strider turned aside, <b>and</b> soon they were lost <b>in</b> a sombre country <b>of</b> dark trees winding among <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> sullen hills.
<br>   The hobbits were glad <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> cheerless lands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perilous Road behind them; <b>but</b> this new country seemed threatening <b>and</b> unfriendly. As they went forward <b>the</b> hills about them steadily rose. Here <b>and</b> there upon heights <b>and</b> ridges they caught glimpses <b>of</b> ancient walls <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> towers: they <b>had</b> an ominous look. Frodo, who <b>was</b> not walking, <b>had</b> time <b>to</b> gaze ahead <b>and</b> <b>to</b> think. He recalled Bilbo's account <b>of</b> his journey <b>and</b> <b>the</b> threatening towers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country near <b>the</b> Troll's wood where his first serious adventure <b>had</b> happened. Frodo guessed that they were now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same region, <b>and</b> wondered if <b>by</b> chance they would pass near <b>the</b> spot.
<br>   “Who lives <b>in</b> this land?” he asked. “And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?”
<br>   “No!” said Strider. “Trolls <b>do</b> not build. No one lives <b>in</b> this land. Men <b>once</b> dwelt here, ages ago; <b>but</b> none remain now. They became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Angmar. But all were destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war that brought <b>the</b> North Kingdom <b>to</b> its end. But that <b>is</b> now so long ago that <b>the</b> hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land.”
<br>   “Where did you learn such tales, if all <b>the</b> land <b>is</b> empty <b>and</b> forgetful?” asked Peregrin. “The birds <b>and</b> beasts <b>do</b> not tell tales <b>of</b> that son.”
<br>   “The heirs <b>of</b> Elendil <b>do</b> not forget all things past,” said Strider; “<b>and</b> many more things than <b>I</b> can tell are remembered <b>in</b> Rivendell.” “Have you often been <b>to</b> Rivendell?” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> have,” said Strider. “<b>I</b> dwelt there <b>once</b>, <b>and</b> still <b>I</b> return when <b>I</b> may.
<br>   There my heart <b>is</b>; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not my fate <b>to</b> sit <b>in</b> peace, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fair house <b>of</b> Elrond.”
<br>   The hills now began <b>to</b> shut them <b>in</b>. The Road behind held <b>on</b> its way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Bruinen, <b>but</b> both were now hidden from view. The travellers came <b>into</b> a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark <b>and</b> silent. Trees with old <b>and</b> twisted roots hung over cliffs, <b>and</b> piled up behind <b>into</b> mounting slopes <b>of</b> pine-wood.
<br>   The hobbits grew <b>very</b> weary. They advanced slowly, for they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered <b>by</b> fallen trees <b>and</b> tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, <b>and</b> because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> fact difficult <b>to</b> find any way up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrow dales. They <b>had</b> been two days <b>in</b> this country when <b>the</b> weather turned wet. The wind began <b>to</b> blow steadily out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> pour <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distant seas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dark heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills <b>in</b> fine drenching rain. By nightfall they were all soaked, <b>and</b> their camp <b>was</b> cheerless, for they could not <b>get</b> any fire <b>to</b> burn. The next day <b>the</b> hills rose still higher <b>and</b> steeper before them, <b>and</b> they were forced <b>to</b> turn away northwards out <b>of</b> their course. Strider seemed <b>to</b> be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, <b>and</b> their stock <b>of</b> provisions <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> run low. It went <b>on</b> raining.
<br>   That night they camped <b>on</b> a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, <b>in</b> which there <b>was</b> a shallow cave, a mere scoop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cliff. Frodo <b>was</b> restless. The cold <b>and</b> wet <b>had</b> made his wound more painful than ever, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ache <b>and</b> sense <b>of</b> deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing <b>and</b> turning <b>and</b> listening fearfully <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stealthy night-noises: wind <b>in</b> chinks <b>of</b> rock, water dripping, a crack, <b>the</b> sudden rattling fall <b>of</b> a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing <b>to</b> smother him; <b>but</b> when he sat up he saw <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> Strider <b>sitting</b> hunched up, smoking his pipe, <b>and</b> watching. He lay down again <b>and</b> passed <b>into</b> an uneasy dream, <b>in</b> which he walked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>in</b> his garden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed faint <b>and</b> dim, less clear than <b>the</b> tall black shadows that stood looking over <b>the</b> hedge.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning he woke <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> rain <b>had</b> stopped. The clouds were still thick, <b>but</b> they were breaking, <b>and</b> pale strips <b>of</b> blue appeared between them. The wind <b>was</b> shifting again. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold <b>and</b> comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling <b>the</b> others <b>to</b> remain under <b>the</b> shelter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, until he came back. He <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> climb up, if he could, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a look at <b>the</b> lie <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land.
<br>   When he returned he <b>was</b> not reassuring. “We have come too far <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north,” he said, “<b>and</b> we must find some way <b>to</b> turn back southwards again. If we keep <b>on</b> as we are going we shall <b>get</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ettendales far north <b>of</b> Rivendell. That <b>is</b> troll-country, <b>and</b> little known <b>to</b> me. We could perhaps find our way through <b>and</b> come round <b>to</b> Rivendell from <b>the</b> north; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> would take too long, for <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> our food would not last. So somehow <b>or</b> other we must find <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen.”
<br>   The rest <b>of</b> that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage between two hills that led them <b>into</b> a valley running south-east, <b>the</b> direction that they wished <b>to</b> take; <b>but</b> towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day they found their road again barred <b>by</b> a ridge <b>of</b> high land; its dark edge against <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> broken <b>into</b> many bare points like teeth <b>of</b> a blunted saw. They <b>had</b> a choice between going back <b>or</b> climbing over <b>it</b>.
<br>   They decided <b>to</b> attempt <b>the</b> climb, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> proved <b>very</b> difficult. Before long Frodo <b>was</b> obliged <b>to</b> dismount <b>and</b> struggle along <b>on</b> foot. Even so they often despaired <b>of</b> getting their pony up, <b>or</b> indeed <b>of</b> finding a path for themselves, burdened as they were. The light <b>was</b> nearly gone, <b>and</b> they were all exhausted, when at last they reached <b>the</b> top. They <b>had</b> climbed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a narrow saddle between two higher points, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, <b>and</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground shivering. His left arm <b>was</b> lifeless, <b>and</b> his side <b>and</b> shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees <b>and</b> rocks about him seemed shadowy <b>and</b> dim.
<br>   “We cannot go any further,” said Merry <b>to</b> Strider. “<b>I</b> am afraid this has been too much for Frodo. <b>I</b> am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we <b>to</b> <b>do</b>? Do you think they will be able <b>to</b> cure him <b>in</b> Rivendell, if we ever <b>get</b> there?”
<br>   “We shall see,” answered Strider. “There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more that <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> chiefly because <b>of</b> his wound that <b>I</b> am so anxious <b>to</b> press <b>on</b>. But <b>I</b> agree that we can go <b>no</b> further tonight.”
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> matter with my master?” asked Sam <b>in</b> a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider. “His wound <b>was</b> small, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> already closed. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> be seen <b>but</b> a cold white mark <b>on</b> his shoulder.”
<br>   “Frodo has been touched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weapons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy,” said Strider, “<b>and</b> there <b>is</b> some poison <b>or</b> evil at work that <b>is</b> beyond my skill <b>to</b> drive out. But <b>do</b> not give up hope, Sam!”
<br>   Night <b>was</b> cold up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high ridge. They lit a small fire down under <b>the</b> gnarled roots <b>of</b> an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: <b>it</b> looked as if stone <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill through <b>the</b> pass, <b>and</b> they heard <b>the</b> tree-tops lower down moaning <b>and</b> sighing. Frodo lay half <b>in</b> a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping <b>by</b> above him, <b>and</b> that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wings rode pursuers that sought him <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> hollows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills.
<br>   The morning dawned bright <b>and</b> fair; <b>the</b> air <b>was</b> clean, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light pale <b>and</b> clear <b>in</b> a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, <b>but</b> (hey longed for <b>the</b> sun <b>to</b> warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> light, Strider took Merry with him <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> survey <b>the</b> country from <b>the</b> height <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass. The sun <b>had</b> risen <b>and</b> <b>was</b> shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news. They were now going more <b>or</b> less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right direction. If they went <b>on</b>, down <b>the</b> further side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge, they would have <b>the</b> Mountains <b>on</b> their left. Some way ahead Strider <b>had</b> caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loudwater again, <b>and</b> he knew that, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hidden from view, <b>the</b> Road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>was</b> not far from <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side nearest <b>to</b> them.
<br>   “We must make for <b>the</b> Road again,” he said. “We cannot hope <b>to</b> find a path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset <b>it</b>, <b>the</b> Road <b>is</b> our only way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford.”
<br>   As soon as they <b>had</b> eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridge; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> way <b>was</b> much easier than they <b>had</b> expected, for <b>the</b> slope <b>was</b> far less steep <b>on</b> this side, <b>and</b> before long Frodo <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony <b>was</b> developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, <b>and</b> for sparing its rider as many jolts as possible. The spirits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party rose again. Even Frodo felt better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning light, <b>but</b> every now <b>and</b> again a mist seemed <b>to</b> obscure his sight, <b>and</b> he passed his hands over his eyes.
<br>   Pippin <b>was</b> a little ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others. Suddenly he turned round <b>and</b> called <b>to</b> them. “There <b>is</b> a path here!” he cried.
<br>   When they came up with him, they saw that he <b>had</b> made <b>no</b> mistake:
<br>   there were clearly <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> a path, that climbed with many windings out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods below <b>and</b> faded away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top behind. In places <b>it</b> <b>was</b> now faint <b>and</b> overgrown, <b>or</b> choked with fallen stones <b>and</b> trees; <b>but</b> at one time <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> have been much used. It <b>was</b> a path made <b>by</b> strong arms <b>and</b> heavy feet. Here <b>and</b> there old trees <b>had</b> been cut <b>or</b> broken down, <b>and</b> large rocks cloven <b>or</b> heaved aside <b>to</b> make a way.
<br>   They followed <b>the</b> track for some while, for <b>it</b> offered much <b>the</b> easiest way down, <b>but</b> they went cautiously, <b>and</b> their anxiety increased as they came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark woods, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> path grew plainer <b>and</b> broader. Suddenly coming out <b>of</b> a belt <b>of</b> fir-trees <b>it</b> ran steeply down a slope, <b>and</b> turned sharply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left round <b>the</b> comer <b>of</b> a rocky shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> comer they looked round <b>and</b> saw that <b>the</b> path ran <b>on</b> over a level strip under <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> a low cliff overhung with trees. In <b>the</b> stony wall there <b>was</b> a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.
<br>   Outside <b>the</b> door they all halted. There <b>was</b> a cave <b>or</b> rock-chamber behind, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom inside <b>nothing</b> could be seen. Strider, Sam, <b>and</b> Merry pushing with all their strength managed <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> door a little wider, <b>and</b> then Strider <b>and</b> Merry went <b>in</b>. They did not go far, for <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor lay many old bones, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be seen near <b>the</b> entrance except some great empty jars <b>and</b> broken pots.
<br>   “Surely this <b>is</b> a troll-hole, if ever there <b>was</b> one!” said Pippin. “Come out, you two, <b>and</b> let us <b>get</b> away. Now we know who made <b>the</b> path -<b>and</b> we <b>had</b> better <b>get</b> off <b>it</b> quick.”
<br>   “There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> need, <b>I</b> think,” said Strider, coining out. “It <b>is</b> certainly a troll-hole, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> have been long forsaken. <b>I</b> don't think we need be afraid. But let us go <b>on</b> down warily, <b>and</b> we shall see.”
<br>   The path went <b>on</b> again from <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right again across <b>the</b> level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking <b>to</b> show Strider that he <b>was</b> still afraid, went <b>on</b> ahead with Merry. Sam <b>and</b> Strider came behind, one <b>on</b> each side <b>of</b> Frodo's pony, for <b>the</b> path <b>was</b> now broad enough for four <b>or</b> five hobbits <b>to</b> walk abreast. But they <b>had</b> not gone <b>very</b> far before Pippin came running back, followed <b>by</b> Merry. They both looked terrified.
<br>   “There are trolls!” Pippin panted. “Down <b>in</b> a clearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods not far below. We got a sight <b>of</b> them through <b>the</b> tree-trunks. They are <b>very</b> large!”
<br>   “We will come <b>and</b> look at them,” said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said <b>nothing</b>, <b>but</b> Sam looked scared.
<br>   The sun <b>was</b> now high, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> shone down through <b>the</b> half-stripped branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> lit <b>the</b> clearing with bright patches <b>of</b> light. They halted suddenly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge, <b>and</b> peered through <b>the</b> tree-trunks, holding their breath. There stood <b>the</b> trolls: three large trolls. One <b>was</b> stooping, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two stood staring at him.
<br>   Strider walked forward unconcernedly. “Get up, old stone!” he said, <b>and</b> broke his stick upon <b>the</b> stooping troll.
<br>   Nothing happened. There <b>was</b> a gasp <b>of</b> astonishment from <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>and</b> then even Frodo laughed. “Well!” he said. “We are forgetting our family history! These must be <b>the</b> <b>very</b> three that were caught <b>by</b> Gandalf, quarrelling over <b>the</b> right way <b>to</b> cook thirteen dwarves <b>and</b> one hobbit.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea we were anywhere near <b>the</b> place!” said Pippin. He knew <b>the</b> story well. Bilbo <b>and</b> Frodo <b>had</b> told <b>it</b> often; <b>but</b> as a matter <b>of</b> fact he <b>had</b> never more than half believed <b>it</b>. Even now he looked at <b>the</b> stone trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them <b>to</b> life again.
<br>   “You are forgetting not only your family history, <b>but</b> all you ever knew about trolls,” said Strider. “It <b>is</b> broad daylight with a bright sun, <b>and</b> yet you come back trying <b>to</b> scare me with a tale <b>of</b> live trolls waiting for us <b>in</b> this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one <b>of</b> them has an old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll!”
<br>   They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: <b>the</b> reminder <b>of</b> Bilbo's first successful adventure <b>was</b> heartening. The sun, too, <b>was</b> warm <b>and</b> comforting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mist before his eyes seemed <b>to</b> be lifting a little. They rested for some time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> glade, <b>and</b> took their mid-day meal right under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trolls” large legs.
<br>   “Won't somebody give us a bit <b>of</b> a song, while <b>the</b> sun <b>is</b> high?” said Merry, when they <b>had</b> finished. “We haven't <b>had</b> a song <b>or</b> a tale for days.”
<br>   “Not since Weathertop,” said Frodo. The others looked at him. “Don't worry about me!” he added. “<b>I</b> feel much better, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't think <b>I</b> could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out <b>of</b> his memory.”
<br>   “Come <b>on</b>, Sam!” said Merry. “There's more stored <b>in</b> your head than you let <b>on</b> about.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know about that,” said Sam. “But how would this suit? It ain't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit <b>of</b> nonsense. But these old images here brought <b>it</b> <b>to</b> my mind.” Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he <b>was</b> at school, he began <b>to</b> sing <b>to</b> an old tune.
<br>   
<br>Troll sat alone <b>on</b> his seat <b>of</b> stone,
<br>And munched <b>and</b> mumbled a bare old bone;
<br>For many a year he <b>had</b> gnawed <b>it</b> near,
<br>For meat <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> come <b>by</b>.
<br>Done <b>by</b>! Gum <b>by</b>!
<br>In a case <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills he dwelt alone,
<br>And meat <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> come <b>by</b>.
<br>
<br>Up came Tom with his big boots <b>on</b>.
<br>Said he <b>to</b> Troll: “Pray, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> yon?
<br>For <b>it</b> looks like <b>the</b> shin o” my nuncle Tim,
<br>As should be a-lyin” <b>in</b> graveyard.
<br>Caveyard! Paveyard!
<br>This many a year has Tim been gone,
<br>And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he were lyin” <b>in</b> graveyard.'
<br>
<br>'My lad,” said Troll, “this bone <b>I</b> stole.
<br>But <b>what</b> be bones that lie <b>in</b> a hole?
<br>Thy nuncle <b>was</b> dead as a lump o” lead,
<br>Afore <b>I</b> found his shinbone.
<br>Tinbone! Thinbone!
<br>He can spare a share for a poor old troll,
<br>For he don't need his shinbone.'
<br>
<br>Said Tom: “<b>I</b> don't see why <b>the</b> likes o” thee
<br>Without axin” leave should go makin” free
<br>With <b>the</b> shank <b>or</b> <b>the</b> shin o” my father's kin;
<br>So hand <b>the</b> old bone over!
<br>Rover! Trover!
<br>Though dead he be, <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> he;
<br>So hand <b>the</b> old bone over!'
<br>
<br>'For a couple o” pins,” says Troll, <b>and</b> grins,
<br>'<b>I</b>'ll eat thee too, <b>and</b> gnaw thy shins.
<br>A bit o” fresh meal will go down sweet!
<br><b>I</b>'ll try my teeth <b>on</b> thee now.
<br>Hee now! See now!
<br><b>I</b>'m <b>tired</b> o” gnawing old bones <b>and</b> skins;
<br><b>I</b>'ve a mind <b>to</b> dine <b>on</b> thee now.'
<br>
<br>But just as he <b>thought</b> his dinner <b>was</b> caught,
<br>He found his hands <b>had</b> hold <b>of</b> naught.
<br>Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind
<br>And gave him <b>the</b> boot <b>to</b> larn him.
<br>Warn him! Darn him!
<br>A bump o” <b>the</b> boot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seat, Tom <b>thought</b>,
<br>Would be <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> larn him.
<br>
<br>But harder than stone <b>is</b> <b>the</b> flesh <b>and</b> bone
<br>Of a troll that sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills alone.
<br>As well set your boot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain's root,
<br>For <b>the</b> seat <b>of</b> a troll don't feel <b>it</b>.
<br>Peel <b>it</b>! Heal <b>it</b>!
<br>Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,
<br>And he knew his toes could feel <b>it</b>.
<br>
<br>Tom's leg <b>is</b> game, since home he came,
<br>And his bootless foot <b>is</b> lasting lame;
<br>But Troll don't care, <b>and</b> he's still there
<br>With <b>the</b> bone he boned from its owner.
<br>Doner! Boner!
<br>Troll's old seat <b>is</b> still <b>the</b> same,
<br>And <b>the</b> bone he boned from its owner!
<br>   
<br>   “Well, that's a warning <b>to</b> us all!” laughed Merry. “It <b>is</b> as well you used a stick, <b>and</b> not your hand, Strider!”
<br>   “Where did you come <b>by</b> that, Sam?” asked Pippin. “<b>I</b>'ve never heard those words before.”
<br>   Sam muttered something inaudible. “It's out <b>of</b> his own head, <b>of</b> course,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee <b>on</b> this journey. First he <b>was</b> a conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up <b>by</b> becoming a wizard—<b>or</b> a warrior!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope not,” said Sam. “<b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> be neither!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> afternoon they went <b>on</b> down <b>the</b> woods. They were probably following <b>the</b> <b>very</b> track that Gandalf, Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dwarves <b>had</b> used many years before. After a few miles they came out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a high <b>bank</b> above <b>the</b> Road. At this point <b>the</b> Road <b>had</b> left <b>the</b> Hoarwell far behind <b>in</b> its narrow valley, <b>and</b> now clung close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, rolling <b>and</b> winding eastward among woods <b>and</b> heather-covered slopes towards <b>the</b> Ford <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountains. Not far down <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> Strider pointed out a stone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass. On <b>it</b> roughly cut <b>and</b> now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes <b>and</b> secret marks.
<br>   “There!” said Merry. “That must be <b>the</b> stone that marked <b>the</b> place where <b>the</b> trolls” gold <b>was</b> hidden. How much <b>is</b> left <b>of</b> Bilbo's share, <b>I</b> wonder, Frodo?”
<br>   Frodo looked at <b>the</b> stone, <b>and</b> wished that Bilbo <b>had</b> brought home <b>no</b> treasure more perilous, nor less easy <b>to</b> pan with. “None at all,” he said. “Bilbo gave <b>it</b> all away. He told me he did not feel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really his, as <b>it</b> came from robbers.”
<br>   The Road lay quiet under <b>the</b> long shadows <b>of</b> early evening. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> any other travellers <b>to</b> be seen. As there <b>was</b> now <b>no</b> other possible course for them <b>to</b> take, they climbed down <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, <b>and</b> turning left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills cut off <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down <b>to</b> meet them from <b>the</b> mountains ahead.
<br>   They were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> look out for a place off <b>the</b> Road, where they could camp for <b>the</b> night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back <b>into</b> their hearts: <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> hoofs behind them. They looked back, <b>but</b> they could not see far because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many windings <b>and</b> rollings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off <b>the</b> beaten way <b>and</b> up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep heather <b>and</b> bilberry brushwood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes above, until they came <b>to</b> a small patch <b>of</b> thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among <b>the</b> bushes, they could see <b>the</b> Road, faint <b>and</b> grey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> failing light, some thirty feel below them. The sound <b>of</b> hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> blown away from them <b>by</b> <b>the</b> breeze, they seemed <b>to</b> catch a dim ringing, as <b>of</b> small bells tinkling.
<br>   “That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!” said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that <b>it</b> did not, <b>but</b> they all remained full <b>of</b> suspicion. They <b>had</b> been <b>in</b> fear <b>of</b> pursuit for so long that any sound from behind seemed ominous <b>and</b> unfriendly. But Strider <b>was</b> now leaning forward, stooped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, with a hand <b>to</b> his ear, <b>and</b> a look <b>of</b> joy <b>on</b> his face.
<br>   The light faded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bushes rustled softly. Clearer <b>and</b> nearer now <b>the</b> bells jingled, <b>and</b> clippety-clip came <b>the</b> quick trotting feet. Suddenly <b>into</b> view below came a white horse, gleaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows, running swiftly. In <b>the</b> dusk its headstall flickered <b>and</b> flashed, as if <b>it</b> were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind him, <b>and</b> his hood <b>was</b> thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>of</b> his speed. To Frodo <b>it</b> appeared that a white light <b>was</b> shining through <b>the</b> form <b>and</b> raiment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rider, as if through a thin veil.
<br>   Strider sprang from hiding <b>and</b> dashed down towards <b>the</b> Road, leaping with a cry through <b>the</b> heather; <b>but</b> even before he <b>had</b> moved <b>or</b> called, <b>the</b> rider <b>had</b> reined <b>in</b> his horse <b>and</b> halted, looking up towards <b>the</b> thicket where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted <b>and</b> ran <b>to</b> meet him calling out: Ai na vedui D?nadan! Mae govannen! His speech <b>and</b> clear ringing voice left <b>no</b> doubt <b>in</b> their hearts: <b>the</b> rider <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-folk. No others that dwelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide world <b>had</b> voices so fair <b>to</b> hear. But there seemed <b>to</b> be a note <b>of</b> haste <b>or</b> fear <b>in</b> his call, <b>and</b> they saw that he <b>was</b> now speaking quickly <b>and</b> urgently <b>to</b> Strider.
<br>   Soon Strider beckoned <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hobbits left <b>the</b> bushes <b>and</b> hurried down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road. “This <b>is</b> Glorfindel, who dwells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond,” said Strider.
<br>   “Hail, <b>and</b> well met at last!” said <b>the</b> Elf-lord <b>to</b> Frodo. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent from Rivendell <b>to</b> look for you. We feared that you were <b>in</b> danger upon <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?” cried Frodo joyfully.
<br>   “No. He <b>had</b> not when <b>I</b> departed; <b>but</b> that <b>was</b> nine days ago,” answered Glorfindel. “Elrond received news that troubled him. Some <b>of</b> my kindred, journeying <b>in</b> your land beyond <b>the</b> Baranduin,* learned that things were amiss, <b>and</b> sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that <b>the</b> Nine were abroad, <b>and</b> that you were astray bearing a great burden <b>without</b> guidance, for Gandalf <b>had</b> not returned. There are few even <b>in</b> Rivendell that can ride openly against <b>the</b> Nine; <b>but</b> such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, <b>and</b> south. It <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> that you might turn far aside <b>to</b> avoid pursuit, <b>and</b> become lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wilderness.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> my lot <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Road, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Mitheithel, <b>and</b> left a token there, nigh <b>on</b> seven days ago. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> Sauron were upon <b>the</b> Bridge, <b>but</b> they withdrew <b>and</b> <b>I</b> pursued them westward. <b>I</b> came also upon two others, <b>but</b> they turned away southward. Since then <b>I</b> have searched for your trail. Two days ago <b>I</b> found <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> over <b>the</b> Bridge; <b>and</b> today <b>I</b> marked where you descended from <b>the</b> hills again. But come! There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> time for further news. Since you are here we must risk <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road <b>and</b> go. There are five behind us, <b>and</b> when they find your trail upon <b>the</b> Road they will ride after us like <b>the</b> wind. And they are not all. Where <b>the</b> other four may be, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. <b>I</b> fear that we may find <b>the</b> Ford <b>is</b> already held against us.”
<br>   While Glorfindel <b>was</b> speaking <b>the</b> shades <b>of</b> evening deepened. Frodo felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since <b>the</b> sun began <b>to</b> sink <b>the</b> mist before his eyes <b>had</b> darkened, <b>and</b> he felt that a shadow <b>was</b> coming between him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> his friends. Now pain assailed him, <b>and</b> he felt cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.
<br>   “My master <b>is</b> sick <b>and</b> wounded,” said Sam angrily. “He can't go <b>on</b> riding after nightfall. He needs rest.”
<br>   Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> taking him gently <b>in</b> his arms he looked <b>in</b> his face with grave anxiety.
<br>   Briefly Strider told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack <b>on</b> their camp under Weathertop, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deadly knife. He drew out <b>the</b> hilt, which he <b>had</b> kept, <b>and</b> handed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> he looked intently at <b>it</b>.
<br>   “There are evil things written <b>on</b> this hilt,” he said; “though maybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep <b>it</b>, Aragorn, till we reach <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond! But be wary, <b>and</b> handle <b>it</b> as little as you may! Alas! <b>the</b> wounds <b>of</b> this weapon are beyond my skill <b>to</b> heal. <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can—<b>but</b> all <b>the</b> more <b>do</b> <b>I</b> urge you now <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> <b>without</b> rest.”
<br>   He searched <b>the</b> wound <b>on</b> Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, <b>and</b> his face grew graver, as if <b>what</b> he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt <b>the</b> chill lessen <b>in</b> his side <b>and</b> arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder <b>to</b> his hand, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pain grew easier. The dusk <b>of</b> evening seemed <b>to</b> grow lighter about him, as if a cloud <b>had</b> been withdrawn. He saw his friends” faces more clearly again, <b>and</b> a measure <b>of</b> new hope <b>and</b> strength returned.
<br>   “You shall ride my horse,” said Glorfindel. “<b>I</b> will shorten <b>the</b> stirrups up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saddle-skins, <b>and</b> you must sit as tight as you can. But you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that <b>I</b> command him <b>to</b> bear. His pace <b>is</b> light <b>and</b> smooth; <b>and</b> if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even <b>the</b> black steeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy cannot rival.”
<br>   “No, he will not!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> shall not ride him, if <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> be carried off <b>to</b> Rivendell <b>or</b> anywhere else, leaving my friends behind <b>in</b> danger.”
<br>   Glorfindel smiled. “<b>I</b> doubt <b>very</b> much,” he said, “if your friends would be <b>in</b> danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you <b>and</b> leave us <b>in</b> peace, <b>I</b> think. It <b>is</b> you, Frodo, <b>and</b> that which you bear that brings us all <b>in</b> peril.”
<br>   To that Frodo <b>had</b> <b>no</b> answer, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> persuaded <b>to</b> mount Glorfindel's white horse. The pony <b>was</b> laden instead with a great part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others” burdens, so that they now marched lighter, <b>and</b> for a time made good speed; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hobbits began <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> hard <b>to</b> keep up with <b>the</b> swift tireless feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf. On he led them, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> darkness, <b>and</b> still <b>on</b> under <b>the</b> deep clouded night. There <b>was</b> neither star nor moon. Not until <b>the</b> grey <b>of</b> dawn did he allow them <b>to</b> halt. Pippin, Merry, <b>and</b> Sam were <b>by</b> that time nearly asleep <b>on</b> their stumbling legs; <b>and</b> even Strider seemed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sag <b>of</b> his shoulders <b>to</b> be weary. Frodo sat upon <b>the</b> horse <b>in</b> a dark dream.
<br>   They cast themselves down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heather a few yards from <b>the</b> road-side, <b>and</b> fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly <b>to</b> have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who <b>had</b> set himself <b>to</b> watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun <b>had</b> now climbed far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> morning, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clouds <b>and</b> mists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night were gone.
<br>   “Drink this!” said Glorfindel <b>to</b> them, pouring for each <b>in</b> turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask <b>of</b> leather. It <b>was</b> clear as spring water <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> taste, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not feel either cool <b>or</b> warm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth; <b>but</b> strength <b>and</b> vigour seemed <b>to</b> flow <b>into</b> all their limbs as they drank <b>it</b>. Eaten after that draught <b>the</b> stale bread <b>and</b> dried fruit (which <b>was</b> now all that they <b>had</b> left) seemed <b>to</b> satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>had</b> done.
<br>   They <b>had</b> rested rather less than five hours when they took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Road again. Glorfindel still urged them <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> only allowed two brief halts during <b>the</b> day's march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> a point where <b>the</b> Road bent right <b>and</b> ran down towards <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, now making straight for <b>the</b> Bruinen. So far there <b>had</b> been <b>no</b> sign <b>or</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit that <b>the</b> hobbits could see <b>or</b> hear; <b>but</b> often Glorfindel would halt <b>and</b> listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, <b>and</b> a look <b>of</b> anxiety clouded his face. Once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> he spoke <b>to</b> Strider <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elf-tongue.
<br>   But however anxious their guides might be, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> plain that <b>the</b> hobbits could go <b>no</b> further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with weariness, <b>and</b> unable <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> anything <b>but</b> their feet <b>and</b> legs. Frodo's pain <b>had</b> redoubled, <b>and</b> during <b>the</b> day things about him faded <b>to</b> shadows <b>of</b> ghostly grey. He almost welcomed <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> night, for then <b>the</b> world seemed less pale <b>and</b> empty.
<br>   The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many miles yet <b>to</b> go between them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ford, <b>and</b> they hobbled forward at <b>the</b> best pace they could manage.
<br>   “Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach <b>the</b> river,” said Glorfindel; “for my heart warns me that <b>the</b> pursuit <b>is</b> now swift behind us, <b>and</b> other danger may be waiting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ford.”
<br>   The Road <b>was</b> still running steadily downhill, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> now <b>in</b> places much grass at either side, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> hobbits walked when they could, <b>to</b> ease their <b>tired</b> feet. In <b>the</b> late afternoon they came <b>to</b> a place where <b>the</b> Road went suddenly under <b>the</b> dark shadow <b>of</b> tall pine-trees, <b>and</b> then plunged <b>into</b> a deep cutting with steep moist walls <b>of</b> red stone. Echoes ran along as they hurried forward; <b>and</b> there seemed <b>to</b> be a sound <b>of</b> many footfalls following their own. All at <b>once</b>, as if through a gate <b>of</b> light, <b>the</b> Road ran out again from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open. There at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, <b>and</b> beyond that <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Rivendell. On <b>the</b> further side <b>was</b> a steep brown <b>bank</b>, threaded <b>by</b> a winding path; <b>and</b> behind that <b>the</b> tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, <b>and</b> peak beyond peak, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fading sky.
<br>   There <b>was</b> still an echo as <b>of</b> following feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising <b>and</b> pouring through <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pines. One moment Glorfindel turned <b>and</b> listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.
<br>   “Fly!” he called. “Fly! The enemy <b>is</b> upon us!”
<br>   The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down <b>the</b> slope. Glorfindel <b>and</b> Strider followed as rear-guard. They were only half way across <b>the</b> flat, when suddenly there <b>was</b> a noise <b>of</b> horses galloping. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees that they <b>had</b> just left rode a Black Rider. He reined his horse <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> halted, swaying <b>in</b> his saddle. Another followed him, <b>and</b> then another; then again two more.
<br>   “Ride forward! Ride!” cried Glorfindel <b>to</b> Frodo.
<br>   He did not obey at <b>once</b>, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking <b>the</b> horse <b>to</b> a walk, he turned <b>and</b> looked back. The Riders seemed <b>to</b> sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark <b>and</b> solid, while all <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> land about them receded as if <b>into</b> a mist. Suddenly he knew <b>in</b> his heart that they were silently commanding him <b>to</b> wait. Then at <b>once</b> fear <b>and</b> hatred awoke <b>in</b> him. His hand left <b>the</b> bridle <b>and</b> gripped <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword, <b>and</b> with a red flash he drew <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Ride <b>on</b>! Ride <b>on</b>!” cried Glorfindel, <b>and</b> then loud <b>and</b> clear he called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!
<br>   At <b>once</b> <b>the</b> white horse sprang away <b>and</b> sped like <b>the</b> wind along <b>the</b> last lap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road. At <b>the</b> same moment <b>the</b> black horses leaped down <b>the</b> hill <b>in</b> pursuit, <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo <b>had</b> heard filling <b>the</b> woods with horror <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastfarthing far away. It <b>was</b> answered; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dismay <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> his friends out from <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> rocks away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo: two galloped madly towards <b>the</b> Ford <b>to</b> cut off his escape. They seemed <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> run like <b>the</b> wind <b>and</b> <b>to</b> grow swiftly larger <b>and</b> darker, as their courses converged with his.
<br>   Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could <b>no</b> longer see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great steeds were <b>no</b> match <b>in</b> speed for <b>the</b> white elf-horse <b>of</b> Glorfindel. He looked forward again, <b>and</b> hope faded. There seemed <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> reaching <b>the</b> Ford before he <b>was</b> cut off <b>by</b> <b>the</b> others that <b>had</b> lain <b>in</b> ambush. He could see them clearly now: they appeared <b>to</b> have cast aside their hoods <b>and</b> black cloaks, <b>and</b> they were robed <b>in</b> white <b>and</b> grey. Swords were naked <b>in</b> their pale hands; helms were <b>on</b> their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, <b>and</b> they called <b>to</b> him with fell voices.
<br>   Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He <b>thought</b> <b>no</b> longer <b>of</b> his sword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes <b>and</b> clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> horse's mane. The wind whistled <b>in</b> his ears, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bells upon <b>the</b> harness rang wild <b>and</b> shrill. A breath <b>of</b> deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash <b>of</b> white fire, <b>the</b> elf-horse speeding as if <b>on</b> wings, passed right before <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foremost Rider.
<br>   Frodo heard <b>the</b> splash <b>of</b> water. It foamed about his feet. He felt <b>the</b> quick heave <b>and</b> surge as <b>the</b> horse left <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> struggled up <b>the</b> stony path. He <b>was</b> climbing <b>the</b> steep <b>bank</b>. He <b>was</b> across <b>the</b> Ford.
<br>   But <b>the</b> pursuers were close behind. At <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>the</b> horse halted <b>and</b> turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at <b>the</b> water's edge below, <b>and</b> Frodo's spirit quailed before <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> their uplifted faces. He knew <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he <b>had</b> done; <b>and</b> he felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> useless <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> escape over <b>the</b> long uncertain path from <b>the</b> Ford <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> Rivendell, if <b>once</b> <b>the</b> Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he <b>was</b> commanded urgently <b>to</b> halt. Hatred again stirred <b>in</b> him, <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> <b>no</b> longer <b>the</b> strength <b>to</b> refuse.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright <b>and</b> brandished his sword.
<br>   “Go back!” he cried. “Go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> follow me <b>no</b> more! “His voice sounded thin <b>and</b> shrill <b>in</b> his own ears. The Riders halted, <b>but</b> Frodo <b>had</b> not <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him with a harsh <b>and</b> chilling laughter. “Come back! Come back!” they called. “To Mordor we will take you!”
<br>   “Go back!” he whispered.
<br>   “The Ring! The Ring!” they cried with deadly voices; <b>and</b> immediately their leader urged his horse forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, followed closely <b>by</b> two others.
<br>   “By Elbereth <b>and</b> L?thien <b>the</b> Fair,” said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, “you shall have neither <b>the</b> Ring nor me!”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> leader, who <b>was</b> now half across <b>the</b> Ford, stood up menacing <b>in</b> his stirrups, <b>and</b> raised up his hand. Frodo <b>was</b> stricken dumb. He felt his tongue cleave <b>to</b> his mouth, <b>and</b> his heart labouring. His sword broke <b>and</b> fell out <b>of</b> his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared <b>and</b> snorted. The foremost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horses <b>had</b> almost set foot upon <b>the</b> shore.
<br>   At that moment there came a roaring <b>and</b> a rushing: a noise <b>of</b> loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw <b>the</b> river below him rise, <b>and</b> down along its course there came a plumed cavalry <b>of</b> waves. White flames seemed <b>to</b> Frodo <b>to</b> flicker <b>on</b> their crests <b>and</b> he half fancied that he saw amid <b>the</b> water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three Riders that were still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew back <b>in</b> dismay.
<br>   With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he saw, beyond <b>the</b> Riders that hesitated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore, a shining figure <b>of</b> white light; <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b> ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grey mist that <b>was</b> falling over <b>the</b> world.
<br>   The black horses were filled with madness, <b>and</b> leaping forward <b>in</b> terror they bore their riders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rushing flood. Their piercing cries were drowned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> roaring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river as <b>it</b> carried them away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roaring <b>and</b> confusion seemed <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> engulf him together with his enemies. He heard <b>and</b> saw <b>no</b> more.

<br>Book II
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 1
<br>MANY MEETINGS
<br>
<br>   Frodo woke <b>and</b> found himself lying <b>in</b> bed. At first he <b>thought</b> that he <b>had</b> slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> memory. Or perhaps he <b>had</b> been ill? But <b>the</b> ceiling looked strange; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flat, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches <b>of</b> sunlight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a waterfall.
<br>   “Where am <b>I</b>, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time?” he said aloud <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. “In <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ten o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning.” said a voice. “It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> October <b>the</b> twenty-fourth, if you want <b>to</b> know.”
<br>   “Gandalf!” cried Frodo, <b>sitting</b> up. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> old wizard, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a chair <b>by</b> <b>the</b> open window.
<br>   “Yes,” he said, “<b>I</b> am here. And you are lucky <b>to</b> be here, too, after all <b>the</b> absurd things you have done since you left home.” Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable <b>and</b> peaceful <b>to</b> argue, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> any case he did not think he would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better <b>of</b> an argument. He <b>was</b> fully awake now, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> his journey <b>was</b> returning: <b>the</b> disastrous “short cut” through <b>the</b> Old Forest <b>the</b> “accident” at The Prancing Pony; <b>and</b> his madness <b>in</b> putting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dell under Weathertop. While he <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b> all these things <b>and</b> trying <b>in</b> vain <b>to</b> bring his memory down <b>to</b> his arriving <b>in</b> Rivendell, there <b>was</b> a long silence, broken only <b>by</b> <b>the</b> soft puffs <b>of</b> Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window.
<br>   “Where's Sam?” Frodo asked at length. “And are <b>the</b> others all right?”
<br>   “Yes, they are all safe <b>and</b> sound,” answered Gandalf. “Sam <b>was</b> here until <b>I</b> sent him off <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some rest, about half an hour ago.”
<br>   “What happened at <b>the</b> Ford?” said Frodo. “It all seemed so dim somehow; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> still does.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> would. You were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> fade,” answered Gandalf. “The wound <b>was</b> overcoming you at last. A few more hours <b>and</b> you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength <b>in</b> you, my dear hobbit! As you showed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Barrow. That <b>was</b> touch <b>and</b> go: perhaps <b>the</b> most dangerous moment <b>of</b> all. <b>I</b> wish you could have held out at Weathertop.”
<br>   “You seem <b>to</b> know a great deal already,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> have not spoken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others about <b>the</b> Barrow. At first <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too horrible; <b>and</b> afterwards there were other things <b>to</b> think about. How <b>do</b> you know about <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “You have talked long <b>in</b> your sleep, Frodo,” said Gandalf gently, “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> has not been hard for me <b>to</b> read your mind <b>and</b> memory. Do not worry! Though <b>I</b> said “absurd” just now, <b>I</b> did not mean <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> think well <b>of</b> you—<b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> small feat <b>to</b> have come so far, <b>and</b> through such dangers, still bearing <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “We should never have done <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Strider,” said Frodo. “But we needed you. <b>I</b> did not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> you.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> delayed,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> that nearly proved our ruin. And yet <b>I</b> am not sure; <b>it</b> may have been better so.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish you would tell me <b>what</b> happened!”
<br>   “All <b>in</b> good time! You are not supposed <b>to</b> talk <b>or</b> worry about anything today, <b>by</b> Elrond's orders.”
<br>   “But talking would stop me thinking <b>and</b> wondering, which are quite as tiring,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> am wide awake now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember so many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought <b>to</b> tell me that at least.”
<br>   “You will soon hear all you wish <b>to</b> know,” said Gandalf. “We shall have a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> will only say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> held captive.”
<br>   “You?” cried Frodo.
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b>, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey,” said <b>the</b> wizard solemnly. “There are many powers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, for good <b>or</b> for evil. Some are greater than <b>I</b> am. Against some <b>I</b> have not yet been measured. But my time <b>is</b> coming. The Morgul-lord <b>and</b> his Black Riders have come forth. War <b>is</b> preparing!”
<br>   “Then you knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders already-before <b>I</b> met them?”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> knew <b>of</b> them. Indeed <b>I</b> spoke <b>of</b> them <b>once</b> <b>to</b> you; for <b>the</b> Black Riders are <b>the</b> Ringwraiths, <b>the</b> Nine Servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings. But <b>I</b> did not know that they <b>had</b> arisen again <b>or</b> <b>I</b> should have fled with you at <b>once</b>. <b>I</b> heard news <b>of</b> them only after <b>I</b> left you <b>in</b> June; <b>but</b> that story must wait. For <b>the</b> moment we have been saved from disaster, <b>by</b> Aragorn.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo, “<b>it</b> <b>was</b> Strider that saved us. Yet <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid <b>of</b> him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. <b>I</b> think, not at any rate until we met Glorfindel.”
<br>   Gandalf smiled. “<b>I</b> have heard all about Sam,” he said. “He has <b>no</b> more doubts now.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am glad,” said Frodo. “For <b>I</b> have become <b>very</b> fond <b>of</b> Strider. Well, fond <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> right word. <b>I</b> mean he <b>is</b> dear <b>to</b> me; though he <b>is</b> strange, <b>and</b> grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often <b>of</b> you. <b>I</b> didn't know that any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People were like that. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b>, well, that they were just big, <b>and</b> rather stupid: kind <b>and</b> stupid like Butterbur; <b>or</b> stupid <b>and</b> wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, except perhaps <b>the</b> Breelanders.”
<br>   “You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman <b>is</b> stupid,” said Gandalf. “He <b>is</b> wise enough <b>on</b> his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, <b>and</b> slower; yet he can see through a brick wall <b>in</b> time (as they say <b>in</b> Bree). But there are few left <b>in</b> Middle-earth like Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn. The race <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings from over <b>the</b> Sea <b>is</b> nearly at an end. It may be that this War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring will be their last adventure.”
<br>   “Do you really mean that Strider <b>is</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Kings?” said Frodo <b>in</b> wonder. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they <b>had</b> all vanished long ago. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> only a Ranger.”
<br>   “Only a Ranger!” cried Gandalf. “My dear Frodo, that <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Rangers are: <b>the</b> last remnant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great people, <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. They have helped me before; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall need their help <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>to</b> come; for we have reached Rivendell, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>is</b> not yet at rest.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> suppose not,” said Frodo. “But so far my only <b>thought</b> has been <b>to</b> <b>get</b> here; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> shan't have <b>to</b> go any further. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> pleasant just <b>to</b> rest. <b>I</b> have <b>had</b> a month <b>of</b> exile <b>and</b> adventure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find that has been as much as <b>I</b> want.”
<br>   He fell silent <b>and</b> shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. “<b>I</b> have been reckoning,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't bring <b>the</b> total up <b>to</b> October <b>the</b> twenty-fourth. It ought <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> twenty-first. We must have reached <b>the</b> Ford <b>by</b> <b>the</b> twentieth.”
<br>   “You have talked <b>and</b> reckoned more than <b>is</b> good for you,” said Gandalf. “How <b>do</b> <b>the</b> side <b>and</b> shoulder feel now?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know.” Frodo answered. “They don't feel at all: which <b>is</b> an improvement, <b>but</b>'–he made an effort–'<b>I</b> can move my arm again a little. Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> coming back <b>to</b> life. It <b>is</b> not cold,” he added, touching his left hand with his right.
<br>   “Good!” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought <b>in</b>.”
<br>   “Days?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Well, four nights <b>and</b> three days, <b>to</b> be exact. The Elves brought you from this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, <b>and</b> Sam has hardly left your side, day <b>or</b> night, except <b>to</b> run messages. Elrond <b>is</b> a master <b>of</b> healing, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> weapons <b>of</b> our Enemy are deadly. To tell you <b>the</b> truth, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little hope; for <b>I</b> suspected that there <b>was</b> some fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blade still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closed wound. But <b>it</b> could not be found until last night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It <b>was</b> deeply buried. <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> working inwards.”
<br>   Frodo shuddered, remembering <b>the</b> cruel knife with notched blade that <b>had</b> vanished <b>in</b> Strider's hands. “Don't be alarmed!” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> gone now. It has been melted. And <b>it</b> seems that Hobbits fade <b>very</b> reluctantly. <b>I</b> have known strong warriors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big People who would quickly have been overcome <b>by</b> that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days.”
<br>   “What would they have done <b>to</b> me?” asked Frodo. “What were <b>the</b> Riders trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b>?”
<br>   “They tried <b>to</b> pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wound. If they <b>had</b> succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker <b>and</b> under their command. You would have became a wraith under <b>the</b> dominion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord; <b>and</b> he would have tormented you for trying <b>to</b> keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> seeing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his hand.”
<br>   “Thank goodness <b>I</b> did not realize <b>the</b> horrible danger!” said Frodo faintly. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mortally afraid, <b>of</b> course; <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known more, <b>I</b> should not have dared even <b>to</b> move. It <b>is</b> a marvel that <b>I</b> escaped!”
<br>   “Yes, fortune <b>or</b> fate have helped you,” said Gandalf, “not <b>to</b> mention courage. For your heart <b>was</b> not touched, <b>and</b> only your shoulder <b>was</b> pierced; <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> because you resisted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a terribly narrow shave, so <b>to</b> speak. You were <b>in</b> gravest peril while you wore <b>the</b> Ring, for then you were half <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wraith-world yourself, <b>and</b> they might have seized you. You could see them, <b>and</b> they could see you.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know,” said Frodo. “They were terrible <b>to</b> behold! But why could we all see their horses?”
<br>   “Because they are real horses; just as <b>the</b> black robes are real robes that they wear <b>to</b> give shape <b>to</b> their nothingness when they have dealings with <b>the</b> living.”
<br>   “Then why <b>do</b> these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they draw near, even <b>the</b> elf-horse <b>of</b> Glorfindel. The dogs howl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> geese scream at them.”
<br>   “Because these horses are born <b>and</b> bred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>in</b> Mordor. Not all his servants <b>and</b> chattels are wraiths! There are orcs <b>and</b> trolls, there are wargs <b>and</b> werewolves; <b>and</b> there have been <b>and</b> still are many Men, warriors <b>and</b> kings, that walk alive under <b>the</b> Sun, <b>and</b> yet are under his sway. And their number <b>is</b> growing daily.”
<br>   “What about Rivendell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves? Is Rivendell safe?”
<br>   “Yes, at present, until all else <b>is</b> conquered. The Elves may fear <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>and</b> they may fly before him, <b>but</b> never again will they listen <b>to</b> him <b>or</b> serve him. And here <b>in</b> Rivendell there live still some <b>of</b> his chief foes: <b>the</b> Elven-wise, lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eldar from beyond <b>the</b> furthest seas. They <b>do</b> not fear <b>the</b> Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Realm live at <b>once</b> <b>in</b> both worlds, <b>and</b> against both <b>the</b> Seen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Unseen they have great power.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> saw a white figure that shone <b>and</b> did not grow dim like <b>the</b> others. Was that Glorfindel then?”
<br>   “Yes, you saw him for a moment as he <b>is</b> upon <b>the</b> other side: one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mighty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Firstborn. He <b>is</b> an Elf-lord <b>of</b> a house <b>of</b> princes. Indeed there <b>is</b> a power <b>in</b> Rivendell <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> might <b>of</b> Mordor, for a while: <b>and</b> elsewhere other powers still dwell. There <b>is</b> power, too, <b>of</b> another kind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if things go <b>on</b> as they are going. The Dark Lord <b>is</b> putting forth all his strength.
<br>   “Still,” he said, standing suddenly up <b>and</b> sticking out his chin. while his beard went stiff <b>and</b> straight like bristling wire, “we must keep up our courage. You will soon be well, if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not talk you <b>to</b> death. You are <b>in</b> Rivendell, <b>and</b> you need not worry about anything for <b>the</b> present.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> haven't any courage <b>to</b> keep up,” said Frodo, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> am not worried at <b>the</b> moment. Just give me news <b>of</b> my friends, <b>and</b> tell me <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affair at <b>the</b> Ford, as <b>I</b> keep <b>on</b> asking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall be content for <b>the</b> present. After that <b>I</b> shall have another sleep, <b>I</b> think; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shan't be able <b>to</b> close my eyes until you have finished <b>the</b> story for me.”
<br>   Gandalf moved his chair <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedside, <b>and</b> took a good look at Frodo. The colour <b>had</b> come back <b>to</b> his face, <b>and</b> his eyes were clear, <b>and</b> fully awake <b>and</b> aware. He <b>was</b> smiling, <b>and</b> there seemed <b>to</b> be little wrong with him. But <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wizard's eye there <b>was</b> a faint change just a hint as <b>it</b> were <b>of</b> transparency, about him, <b>and</b> especially about <b>the</b> left hand that lay outside upon <b>the</b> coverlet.
<br>   “Still that must be expected,” said Gandalf <b>to</b> himself. “He <b>is</b> not half through yet, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he will come <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end not even Elrond can foretell. Not <b>to</b> evil, <b>I</b> think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes <b>to</b> see that can.”
<br>   “You look splendid,” he said aloud. “<b>I</b> will risk a brief tale <b>without</b> consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, <b>and</b> then you must sleep again. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened, as far as <b>I</b> can gather. The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled. They did not need <b>the</b> guidance <b>of</b> their horses any longer: you <b>had</b> become visible <b>to</b> them, being already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> threshold <b>of</b> their world. And also <b>the</b> Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off <b>the</b> road, <b>or</b> they would have been ridden down. They knew that <b>nothing</b> could save you, if <b>the</b> white horse could not. The Riders were too swift <b>to</b> overtake, <b>and</b> too many <b>to</b> oppose. On foot even Glorfindel <b>and</b> Aragorn together could not with stand all <b>the</b> Nine at <b>once</b>.
<br>   “When <b>the</b> Ringwraiths swept <b>by</b>, your friends ran up behind. Close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford there <b>is</b> a small hollow beside <b>the</b> road masked <b>by</b> a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if <b>the</b> Riders tried <b>to</b> cross, <b>and</b> then he would have <b>to</b> deal with any that were left <b>on</b> his side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. The moment <b>the</b> flood appeared, he rushed out, followed <b>by</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b>. others with flaming brands. Caught between fire <b>and</b> water, <b>and</b> seeing an Elf-lord revealed <b>in</b> his wrath, they were dismayed, <b>and</b> their horses were stricken with madness. Three were carried away <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first assault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flood; <b>the</b> others were now hurled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>by</b> their horses <b>and</b> overwhelmed.”
<br>   “And <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf. “Their horses must have perished, <b>and</b> <b>without</b> them they are crippled. But <b>the</b> Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed. However, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> fear from them at present. Your friends crossed after <b>the</b> flood <b>had</b> passed; <b>and</b> they found you lying <b>on</b> your face at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, with a broken sword under you. The horse <b>was</b> standing guard beside you. You were pale <b>and</b> cold, <b>and</b> they feared that you were dead, <b>or</b> worse. Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.”
<br>   “Who made <b>the</b> flood?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “Elrond commanded <b>it</b>,” answered Gandalf. “The river <b>of</b> this valley <b>is</b> under his power, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will rise <b>in</b> anger when he has great need <b>to</b> bar <b>the</b> Ford. As soon as <b>the</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ringwraiths rode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>the</b> flood <b>was</b> released. If <b>I</b> may say so, <b>I</b> added a few touches <b>of</b> my own: you may not have noticed, <b>but</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> great white horses with shining white riders; <b>and</b> there were many rolling <b>and</b> grinding boulders. For a moment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid that we <b>had</b> let loose too fierce a wrath, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flood would <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> hand <b>and</b> wash you all away. There <b>is</b> great vigour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters that come down from <b>the</b> snows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> all comes back <b>to</b> me now,” said Frodo: “<b>the</b> tremendous roaring. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drowning, with my friends <b>and</b> enemies <b>and</b> all. But now we are safe!”
<br>   Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, <b>but</b> he <b>had</b> shut his eyes. “Yes, you are all safe for <b>the</b> present. Soon there will be feasting <b>and</b> merrymaking <b>to</b> celebrate <b>the</b> victory at <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen, <b>and</b> you will all be there <b>in</b> places <b>of</b> honour.”
<br>   “Splendid!” said Frodo. “It <b>is</b> wonderful that Elrond, <b>and</b> Glorfindel <b>and</b> such great lords, not <b>to</b> mention Strider, should take so much trouble <b>and</b> show me so much kindness.”
<br>   “Well, there are many reasons why they should,” said Gandalf, smiling. “<b>I</b> am one good reason. The Ring <b>is</b> another: you are <b>the</b> Ring-bearer. And you are <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Bilbo, <b>the</b> Ring-finder.”
<br>   “Dear Bilbo!” said Frodo sleepily. “<b>I</b> wonder where he <b>is</b>. <b>I</b> wish he <b>was</b> here <b>and</b> could hear all about <b>it</b>. It would have made him laugh, The cow jumped over <b>the</b> Moon! And <b>the</b> poor old troll!” With that he fell fast asleep.
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> now safe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Last Homely House east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. That house <b>was</b>, as Bilbo <b>had</b> long ago reported, “a perfect house, whether you like food <b>or</b> sleep, <b>or</b> story-telling <b>or</b> singing, <b>or</b> just <b>sitting</b> <b>and</b> thinking best, <b>or</b> a pleasant mixture <b>of</b> them all”. Merely <b>to</b> be there <b>was</b> a cure for weariness, fear, <b>and</b> sadness.
<br>   As <b>the</b> evening drew <b>on</b>, Frodo woke up again, <b>and</b> he found that he <b>no</b> longer felt <b>in</b> need <b>of</b> rest <b>or</b> sleep, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> a mind for food <b>and</b> drink, <b>and</b> probably for singing <b>and</b> story-telling afterwards. He got out <b>of</b> bed <b>and</b> discovered that his arm <b>was</b> already nearly as useful again as <b>it</b> ever <b>had</b> been. He found laid ready clean garments <b>of</b> green cloth that fitted him excellently. Looking <b>in</b> a mirror he <b>was</b> startled <b>to</b> see a much thinner reflection <b>of</b> himself than he remembered: <b>it</b> looked remarkably like <b>the</b> young nephew <b>of</b> Bilbo who used <b>to</b> go tramping with his uncle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.
<br>   “Yes, you have seen a thing <b>or</b> two since you last <b>peeped</b> out <b>of</b> a looking-glass,” he said <b>to</b> his reflection. “But now for a merry meeting!”
<br>   He stretched out his arms <b>and</b> whistled a tune.
<br>   At that moment there <b>was</b> a knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> Sam came <b>in</b>. He ran <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> took his left hand, awkwardly <b>and</b> shyly. He stroked <b>it</b> gently <b>and</b> then he blushed <b>and</b> turned hastily away.
<br>   “Hullo, Sam!” said Frodo.
<br>   “It's warm!” said Sam. “Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through <b>the</b> long nights. But glory <b>and</b> trumpets!” he cried, turning round again with shining eyes <b>and</b> dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. “It's fine <b>to</b> see you up <b>and</b> yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me <b>to</b> come <b>and</b> see if you were ready <b>to</b> come down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>was</b> joking.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am ready,” said Frodo. “Let's go <b>and</b> look for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> can take you <b>to</b> them, sir,” said Sam. “It's a big house this, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> peculiar. Always a bit more <b>to</b> discover, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> knowing <b>what</b> you'll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, <b>and</b> Elves there! Some like kings, terrible <b>and</b> splendid; <b>and</b> some as merry as children. And <b>the</b> music <b>and</b> <b>the</b> singing-not that <b>I</b> have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> time <b>or</b> <b>the</b> heart for much listening since we got here. But <b>I</b>'m getting <b>to</b> know some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know <b>what</b> you have been doing, Sam,” said Frodo, taking his arm. “But you shall be merry tonight, <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> your heart's content. Come <b>on</b>, guide me round <b>the</b> corners!”
<br>   Sam led him along several passages <b>and</b> down many steps <b>and</b> out <b>into</b> a high garden above <b>the</b> steep <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. He found his friends <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a porch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house looking east. Shadows <b>had</b> fallen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley below, <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> still a light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains far above. The air <b>was</b> warm. The sound <b>of</b> running <b>and</b> falling water <b>was</b> loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> evening <b>was</b> filled with a faint scent <b>of</b> trees <b>and</b> flowers, as if summer still lingered <b>in</b> Elrond's gardens.
<br>   “Hurray!” cried Pippin, springing up. “Here <b>is</b> our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring!”
<br>   “Hush!” said Gandalf from <b>the</b> shadows at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porch. “Evil things <b>do</b> not come <b>into</b> this valley; <b>but</b> all <b>the</b> same we should not name them. The Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>is</b> not Frodo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>of</b> Mordor, whose power <b>is</b> again stretching out over <b>the</b> world! We are <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a fortress. Outside <b>it</b> <b>is</b> getting dark.”
<br>   “Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,” said Pippin. “He thinks <b>I</b> need keeping <b>in</b> order. But <b>it</b> seems impossible, somehow, <b>to</b> feel gloomy <b>or</b> depressed <b>in</b> this place. <b>I</b> feel <b>I</b> could sing, if <b>I</b> knew <b>the</b> right song for <b>the</b> occasion.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> feel like singing myself,” laughed Frodo. “Though at <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> feel more like eating <b>and</b> drinking!”
<br>   “That will soon be cured,” said Pippin. “You have shown your usual cunning <b>in</b> getting up just <b>in</b> time for a meal.”
<br>   “More than meal! A feast!” said Merry. “As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, <b>the</b> preparations began.” He <b>had</b> hardly finished speaking when they were summoned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ringing <b>of</b> many bells.
<br>   The hall <b>of</b> Elrond's house <b>was</b> filled with folk: Elves for <b>the</b> most part, though there were a few guests <b>of</b> other sorts. Elrond, as <b>was</b> his custom, sat <b>in</b> a great chair at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long table upon <b>the</b> dais; <b>and</b> next <b>to</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one side sat Glorfindel, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side sat Gandalf.
<br>   Frodo looked at them <b>in</b> wonder, for he <b>had</b> never before seen Elrond, <b>of</b> whom so many tales spoke; <b>and</b> as they sat upon his right hand <b>and</b> his left, Glorfindel, <b>and</b> even Gandalf, whom he <b>thought</b> he knew so well, were revealed as lords <b>of</b> dignity <b>and</b> power. Gandalf <b>was</b> shorter <b>in</b> stature than <b>the</b> other two; <b>but</b> his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, <b>and</b> his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king <b>of</b> ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly <b>into</b> fire.
<br>   Glorfindel <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> straight; his hair <b>was</b> <b>of</b> shining gold, his face fair <b>and</b> young <b>and</b> fearless <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> joy; his eyes were bright <b>and</b> keen, <b>and</b> his voice like music; <b>on</b> his brow sat wisdom, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> his hand <b>was</b> strength.
<br>   The face <b>of</b> Elrond <b>was</b> ageless, neither old nor young, though <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> many things both glad <b>and</b> sorrowful. His hair <b>was</b> dark as <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> twilight, <b>and</b> upon <b>it</b> <b>was</b> set a circlet <b>of</b> silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> them <b>was</b> a light like <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, <b>and</b> yet hale as a tried warrior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fulness <b>of</b> his strength. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>and</b> mighty among both Elves <b>and</b> Men.
<br>   In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, against <b>the</b> woven cloths upon <b>the</b> wall, there <b>was</b> a chair under a canopy, <b>and</b> there sat a lady fair <b>to</b> look upon, <b>and</b> so like <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>in</b> form <b>of</b> womanhood <b>to</b> Elrond that Frodo guessed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> one <b>of</b> his close kindred. Young <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> yet not so. The braids <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dark hair were touched <b>by</b> <b>no</b> frost, <b>her</b> white arms <b>and</b> clear face were flawless <b>and</b> smooth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> stars <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly <b>she</b> looked, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> knowledge were <b>in</b> <b>her</b> glance, as <b>of</b> one who has known many things that <b>the</b> years bring. Above <b>her</b> brow <b>her</b> head <b>was</b> covered with a cap <b>of</b> silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; <b>but</b> <b>her</b> soft grey raiment <b>had</b> <b>no</b> ornament save a girdle <b>of</b> leaves wrought <b>in</b> silver.
<br>   So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that Frodo saw <b>her</b> whom few mortals <b>had</b> yet seen; Arwen, daughter <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>in</b> whom <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said that <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> L?thien <b>had</b> come <b>on</b> earth again; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> called Und?miel, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Evenstar <b>of</b> <b>her</b> people. Long <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's kin, <b>in</b> L?rien beyond <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>but</b> lately returned <b>to</b> Rivendell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's house. But <b>her</b> brothers, Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir, were out upon errantry: for they rode often far afield with <b>the</b> Rangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, forgetting never their mother's torment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orcs.
<br>   Such loveliness <b>in</b> living thing Frodo <b>had</b> never seen before nor imagined <b>in</b> his mind; <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> both surprised <b>and</b> abashed <b>to</b> find that he <b>had</b> a seat at Elrond's table among all these folk so high <b>and</b> fair. Though he <b>had</b> a suitable chair, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> raised upon several cushions, he felt <b>very</b> small, <b>and</b> rather out <b>of</b> place; <b>but</b> that feeling quickly passed. The feast <b>was</b> merry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> food all that his hunger could desire. It <b>was</b> some time before he looked about him again <b>or</b> even turned <b>to</b> his neighbours.
<br>   He looked first for his friends. Sam <b>had</b> begged <b>to</b> be allowed <b>to</b> wait <b>on</b> his master, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> been told that for this time he <b>was</b> a guest <b>of</b> honour. Frodo could see him now, <b>sitting</b> with Pippin <b>and</b> Merry at <b>the</b> upper end <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-tables close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dais. He could see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> Strider.
<br>   Next <b>to</b> Frodo <b>on</b> his right sat a dwarf <b>of</b> important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, <b>very</b> long <b>and</b> forked, <b>was</b> white, nearly as white as <b>the</b> snow-white cloth <b>of</b> his garments. He wore a silver belt, <b>and</b> round his neck hung a chain <b>of</b> silver <b>and</b> diamonds. Frodo stopped eating <b>to</b> look at him.
<br>   “Welcome <b>and</b> well met!” said <b>the</b> dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually rose from his seat <b>and</b> bowed. “Gl?<b>in</b> at your service,” he said, <b>and</b> bowed still lower.
<br>   “Frodo Baggins at your service <b>and</b> your family's,” said Frodo correctly, rising <b>in</b> surprise <b>and</b> scattering his cushions. “Am <b>I</b> right <b>in</b> guessing that you are <b>the</b> Gl?<b>in</b>, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve companions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Thorin Oakenshield?”
<br>   “Quite right,” answered <b>the</b> dwarf, gathering up <b>the</b> cushions <b>and</b> courteously assisting Frodo back <b>into</b> his seat. “And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask, for <b>I</b> have already been told that you are <b>the</b> kinsman <b>and</b> adopted heir <b>of</b> our friend Bilbo <b>the</b> renowned. Allow me <b>to</b> congratulate you <b>on</b> your recovery.”
<br>   “Thank you <b>very</b> much,” said Frodo.
<br>   “You have <b>had</b> some <b>very</b> strange adventures, <b>I</b> hear,” said Gl?<b>in</b>. “<b>I</b> wonder greatly <b>what</b> brings four hobbits <b>on</b> so long a journey. Nothing like <b>it</b> has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps <b>I</b> should not inquire too closely, since Elrond <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>do</b> not seem disposed <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> this?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think we will not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, at least not yet,” said Frodo politely.
<br>   He guessed that even <b>in</b> Elrond's house <b>the</b> matter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> not one for casual talk; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> any case he wished <b>to</b> forget his troubles for a time. “But <b>I</b> am equally curious,” he added, “<b>to</b> learn <b>what</b> brings so important a dwarf so far from <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain.”
<br>   Gl?<b>in</b> looked at him. “If you have not heard, <b>I</b> think we will not speak yet <b>of</b> that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, <b>I</b> believe, <b>and</b> then we shall all hear many things. But there <b>is</b> much else that may be told.”
<br>   Throughout <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meal they talked together, <b>but</b> Frodo listened more than he spoke; for <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire, apart from <b>the</b> Ring, seemed small <b>and</b> far-away <b>and</b> unimportant, while Gl?<b>in</b> <b>had</b> much <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern regions <b>of</b> Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn <b>the</b> Old, son <b>of</b> Beorn, <b>was</b> now <b>the</b> lord <b>of</b> many sturdy men, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their land between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “lndeed,” said Gl?<b>in</b>, “if <b>it</b> were not for <b>the</b> Beornings, <b>the</b> passage from Dale <b>to</b> Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are valiant men <b>and</b> keep open <b>the</b> High Pass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Carrock. But their tolls are high,” he added with a shake <b>of</b> his head; “<b>and</b> like Beorn <b>of</b> old they are not over fond <b>of</b> dwarves. Still, they are trusty, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> much <b>in</b> these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly <b>to</b> us as <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Dale. They are good folk, <b>the</b> Bardings. The grandson <b>of</b> Bard <b>the</b> Bowman rules them, Brand son <b>of</b> Bain son <b>of</b> Bard. He <b>is</b> a strong king, <b>and</b> his realm now reaches far south <b>and</b> east <b>of</b> Esgaroth.”
<br>   “And <b>what</b> <b>of</b> your own people?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> much <b>to</b> tell, good <b>and</b> bad,” said Gl?<b>in</b>; “yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> mostly good: we have so far been fortunate, though we <b>do</b> not escape <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> these times. If you really wish <b>to</b> hear <b>of</b> us, <b>I</b> will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves” tongues run <b>on</b> when speaking <b>of</b> their handiwork, they say.”
<br>   And with that Gl?<b>in</b> embarked <b>on</b> a long account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf-kingdom. He <b>was</b> delighted <b>to</b> have found so polite a listener; for Frodo showed <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> weariness <b>and</b> made <b>no</b> attempt <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject, though actually he soon got rather lost among <b>the</b> strange names <b>of</b> people <b>and</b> places that he <b>had</b> never heard <b>of</b> before. He <b>was</b> interested, however, <b>to</b> hear that D?<b>in</b> <b>was</b> still King under <b>the</b> Mountain, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> now old (<b>having</b> passed his two hundred <b>and</b> fiftieth year), venerable, <b>and</b> fabulously rich. Of <b>the</b> ten companions who <b>had</b> survived <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Gl?<b>in</b>, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, <b>and</b> Bombur. Bombur <b>was</b> now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch <b>to</b> his chair at table, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took six young dwarves <b>to</b> lift him.
<br>   “And <b>what</b> has become <b>of</b> Balin <b>and</b> Ori <b>and</b> ?<b>in</b>?” asked Frodo.
<br>   A shadow passed over Gl?<b>in</b>'s face. “We <b>do</b> not know,” he answered. “It <b>is</b> largely <b>on</b> account <b>of</b> Balin that <b>I</b> have come <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> those that dwell <b>in</b> Rivendell. But tonight let us speak <b>of</b> merrier things!”
<br>   Gl?<b>in</b> began then <b>to</b> talk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> his people, telling Frodo about their great labours <b>in</b> Dale <b>and</b> under <b>the</b> Mountain. “We have done well,” he said. “But <b>in</b> metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many <b>of</b> whose. secrets are lost. We make good armour <b>and</b> keen swords, <b>but</b> we cannot again make mail <b>or</b> blade <b>to</b> match those that were made before <b>the</b> dragon came. Only <b>in</b> mining <b>and</b> building have we surpassed <b>the</b> old days. You should see <b>the</b> waterways <b>of</b> Dale, Frodo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fountains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pools! You should see <b>the</b> stone-paved roads <b>of</b> many colours! And <b>the</b> halls <b>and</b> cavernous streets under <b>the</b> earth with arches carved like trees; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terraces <b>and</b> towers upon <b>the</b> Mountain's sides! Then you would see that we have not been idle.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will come <b>and</b> see them, if ever <b>I</b> can,” said Frodo. “How surprised Bilbo would have been <b>to</b> see all <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Desolation <b>of</b> Smaug!”
<br>   Gl?<b>in</b> looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled. “You were <b>very</b> fond <b>of</b> Bilbo were you not?” he asked.
<br>   “Yes,” answered Frodo. “<b>I</b> would rather see him than all <b>the</b> towers <b>and</b> palaces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   At length <b>the</b> feast came <b>to</b> an end. Elrond <b>and</b> Arwen rose <b>and</b> went down <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company followed them <b>in</b> due order. The doors were thrown open, <b>and</b> they went across a wide passage <b>and</b> through other doors, <b>and</b> came <b>into</b> a further hall. In <b>it</b> were <b>no</b> tables, <b>but</b> a bright fire <b>was</b> burning <b>in</b> a great hearth between <b>the</b> carven pillars upon either side.
<br>   Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. “This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Here you will hear many songs <b>and</b> tales-if you can keep awake. But except <b>on</b> high days <b>it</b> usually stands empty <b>and</b> quiet, <b>and</b> people come here who wish for peace, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b>. There <b>is</b> always a fire here, all <b>the</b> year round, <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> little other light.”
<br>   As Elrond entered <b>and</b> went towards <b>the</b> seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began <b>to</b> make sweet music. Slowly <b>the</b> hall filled, <b>and</b> Frodo looked with delight upon <b>the</b> many fair faces that were gathered together; <b>the</b> golden firelight played upon them <b>and</b> shimmered <b>in</b> their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from <b>the</b> further end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, a small dark figure seated <b>on</b> a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>was</b> a drinking-cup <b>and</b> some bread. Frodo wondered whether he <b>was</b> ill (if people were ever ill <b>in</b> Rivendell), <b>and</b> <b>had</b> been unable <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feast. His head seemed sunk <b>in</b> sleep <b>on</b> his breast, <b>and</b> a fold <b>of</b> his dark cloak <b>was</b> drawn over his face.
<br>   Elrond went forward <b>and</b> stood beside <b>the</b> silent figure. “Awake little master. he said, with a smile. Then, turning <b>to</b> Frodo, he beckoned <b>to</b> him. “Now at last <b>the</b> hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,” he said. “Here <b>is</b> a friend that you have long missed.”
<br>   The dark figure raised its head <b>and</b> uncovered its face.
<br>   “Bilbo!” cried Frodo with sudden recognition, <b>and</b> he sprang forward.
<br>   “Hullo, Frodo my lad!” said Bilbo. “So you have got here at last. <b>I</b> hoped you would manage <b>it</b>. Well, well! So all this feasting <b>is</b> <b>in</b> your honour, <b>I</b> hear. <b>I</b> hope you enjoyed yourself?”
<br>   “Why weren't you there?” cried Frodo. “And why haven't <b>I</b> been allowed <b>to</b> see you before?”
<br>   “Because you were asleep. <b>I</b> have seen a good deal <b>of</b> you. <b>I</b> have sat <b>by</b> your side with Sam each day. But as for <b>the</b> feast` <b>I</b> don't go <b>in</b> for such things much now. And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> something else <b>to</b> <b>do</b>.”
<br>   “What were you doing?”
<br>   “Why, <b>sitting</b> <b>and</b> thinking. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a lot <b>of</b> that nowadays, <b>and</b> this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best place <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b>, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!” he said, cocking an eye at Elrond. There <b>was</b> a bright twinkle <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> sleepiness that Frodo could see. “Wake up! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want <b>to</b> know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, <b>and</b> you have disturbed me-<b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> making up a song. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stuck over a line <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> thinking about them; <b>but</b> now <b>I</b> don't suppose <b>I</b> shall ever <b>get</b> them right. There will be such a deal <b>of</b> singing that <b>the</b> ideas will be driven clean out <b>of</b> my head. <b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my friend <b>the</b> D?nadan <b>to</b> help me. Where <b>is</b> he?”
<br>   Elrond laughed. “He shall be found,” he said. “Then you two shall go <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> finish your task, <b>and</b> we will hear <b>it</b> <b>and</b> judge <b>it</b> before we end our merrymaking.” Messengers were sent <b>to</b> find Bilbo's friend, though none knew where he <b>was</b>, <b>or</b> why he <b>had</b> not been present at <b>the</b> feast.
<br>   In <b>the</b> meanwhile Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo sat side <b>by</b> side, <b>and</b> Sam came quickly <b>and</b> placed himself near them. They talked together <b>in</b> soft voices, oblivious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mirth <b>and</b> music <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall about them. Bilbo <b>had</b> not much <b>to</b> say <b>of</b> himself. When he <b>had</b> left Hobbiton he <b>had</b> wandered off aimlessly, along <b>the</b> Road <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country <b>on</b> either side; <b>but</b> somehow he <b>had</b> steered all <b>the</b> time towards Rivendell. “<b>I</b> got here <b>without</b> much adventure,” he said, “<b>and</b> after a rest <b>I</b> went <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> dwarves <b>to</b> Dale: my last journey. <b>I</b> shan't travel again. Old Balin <b>had</b> gone away. Then <b>I</b> came back here, <b>and</b> here <b>I</b> have been. <b>I</b> have done this <b>and</b> that. <b>I</b> have written some more <b>of</b> my <b>book</b>. And, <b>of</b> course, <b>I</b> make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just <b>to</b> please me, <b>I</b> think; for, <b>of</b> course, they aren't really good enough for Rivendell. And <b>I</b> listen <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think. Time doesn't seem <b>to</b> pass here: <b>it</b> just <b>is</b>. A remarkable place altogether.
<br>   “<b>I</b> hear all kinds <b>of</b> news, from over <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>but</b> hardly anything from <b>the</b> Shire. <b>I</b> heard about <b>the</b> Ring, <b>of</b> course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these last few years. The D?nadan has told me more. Fancy that ring <b>of</b> mine causing such a disturbance! It <b>is</b> a pity that Gandalf did not find out more sooner. <b>I</b> could have brought <b>the</b> thing here myself long ago <b>without</b> so much trouble. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> several times <b>of</b> going back <b>to</b> Hobbiton for <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am getting old, <b>and</b> they would not let me: Gandalf <b>and</b> Elrond, <b>I</b> mean. They seemed <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> Enemy <b>was</b> looking high <b>and</b> low for me, <b>and</b> would make mincemeat <b>of</b> me, if he caught me tottering about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild.
<br>   “And Gandalf said: “The Ring has passed <b>on</b>, Bilbo. It would <b>do</b> <b>no</b> good <b>to</b> you <b>or</b> <b>to</b> others, if you tried <b>to</b> meddle with <b>it</b> again.” Odd sort <b>of</b> remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he <b>was</b> looking after you, so <b>I</b> let things be. <b>I</b> am frightfully glad <b>to</b> see you safe <b>and</b> sound.” He paused <b>and</b> looked at Frodo doubtfully.
<br>   “Have you got <b>it</b> here?” he asked <b>in</b> a whisper. “<b>I</b> can't help feeling curious, you know, after all <b>I</b>'ve heard. <b>I</b> should <b>very</b> much like just <b>to</b> peep at <b>it</b> again.”
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b>'ve got <b>it</b>,” answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. “It looks just <b>the</b> same as ever <b>it</b> did.”
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> should just like <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> for a moment,” said Bilbo.
<br>   When he <b>had</b> dressed, Frodo found that while he slept <b>the</b> Ring <b>had</b> been hung about his neck <b>on</b> a new chain, light <b>but</b> strong. Slowly he drew <b>it</b> out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back <b>the</b> Ring. To his distress <b>and</b> amazement he found that he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed <b>to</b> have fallen between them, <b>and</b> through <b>it</b> he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face <b>and</b> bony groping hands. He felt a desire <b>to</b> strike him.
<br>   The music <b>and</b> singing round them seemed <b>to</b> falter <b>and</b> a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face <b>and</b> passed his hand across his eyes. “<b>I</b> understand now,” he said. “Put <b>it</b> away! <b>I</b> am sorry: sorry you have come <b>in</b> for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have an end? <b>I</b> suppose not. Someone else always has <b>to</b> carry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story. Well, <b>it</b> can't be helped. <b>I</b> wonder if <b>it</b>'s any good trying <b>to</b> finish my <b>book</b>? But don't let's worry about <b>it</b> now-let's have some real News! Tell me all about <b>the</b> Shire!”
<br>   Frodo hid <b>the</b> Ring away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow passed leaving hardly a shred <b>of</b> memory. The light <b>and</b> music <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>was</b> about him again. Bilbo smiled <b>and</b> laughed happily. Every item <b>of</b> news from <b>the</b> Shire that Frodo could tell-aided <b>and</b> corrected now <b>and</b> again <b>by</b> Sam-<b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest interest <b>to</b> him, from <b>the</b> felling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> least tree <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest child <b>in</b> Hobbiton. They were so deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Four Farthings that they did not notice <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> a man clad <b>in</b> dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.
<br>   Suddenly Bilbo looked up. “Ah, there you are at last, D?nadan!” he cried.
<br>   “Strider!” said Frodo. “You seem <b>to</b> have a lot <b>of</b> names.”
<br>   “Well, Strider <b>is</b> one that <b>I</b> haven't heard before, anyway,” said Bilbo. “What <b>do</b> you call him that for?”
<br>   “They call me that <b>in</b> Bree,” said Strider laughing, “<b>and</b> that <b>is</b> how <b>I</b> <b>was</b> introduced <b>to</b> him.”
<br>   “And why <b>do</b> you call him D?nadan?” asked Frodo.
<br>   “The D?nadan,” said Bilbo. “He <b>is</b> often called that here. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you knew enough Elvish at least <b>to</b> know d?n-udan: Man <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, N?menorean. But this <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> time for lessons!” He turned <b>to</b> Strider.
<br>   “Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at <b>the</b> feast? The Lady Arwen <b>was</b> there.”
<br>   Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. “<b>I</b> know,” he said. “But often <b>I</b> must put mirth aside. Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir have returned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild unlooked-for, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> tidings that <b>I</b> wished <b>to</b> hear at <b>once</b>.”
<br>   “Well, my dear fellow,” said Bilbo, “now you've heard <b>the</b> news, can't you spare me a moment? <b>I</b> want your help <b>in</b> something urgent. Elrond says this song <b>of</b> mine <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be finished before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am stuck. Let's go off <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> polish <b>it</b> up!”
<br>   Strider smiled. “Come then!” he said. “Let me hear <b>it</b>!”
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> left <b>to</b> himself for a while. for Sam <b>had</b> fallen asleep. He <b>was</b> alone <b>and</b> felt rather forlorn` although all about him <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> instruments. <b>and</b> they gave <b>no</b> heed <b>to</b> anything else. Frodo began <b>to</b> listen.
<br>   At first <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melodies <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interwoven words <b>in</b> elven-tongues, even though he understood them little` held him <b>in</b> a spell, as soon as he began <b>to</b> attend <b>to</b> them. Almost <b>it</b> seemed that <b>the</b> words took shape, <b>and</b> visions <b>of</b> far lands <b>and</b> bright things that he <b>had</b> never yet imagined opened out before him; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas <b>of</b> foam that sighed upon <b>the</b> margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Then <b>the</b> enchantment became more <b>and</b> more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river <b>of</b> swelling gold <b>and</b> silver <b>was</b> flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern <b>to</b> be comprehended; <b>it</b> became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> throbbing air about him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> drenched <b>and</b> drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight <b>into</b> a deep realm <b>of</b> sleep.
<br>   There he wandered long <b>in</b> a dream <b>of</b> music that turned <b>into</b> running water, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>into</b> a voice. It seemed <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first <b>and</b> then clearer ran <b>the</b> words.
<br>   
<br>E?rendil <b>was</b> a mariner
<br>that tarried <b>in</b> Arvernien;
<br>he built a boat <b>of</b> timber felled
<br><b>in</b> Nimbrethil <b>to</b> journey <b>in</b>;
<br><b>her</b> sails he wove <b>of</b> silver fair,
<br><b>of</b> silver were <b>her</b> lanterns made,
<br><b>her</b> prow <b>was</b> fashioned like a swan,
<br><b>and</b> light upon <b>her</b> banners laid.
<br>
<br>In panoply <b>of</b> ancient kings,
<br><b>in</b> chain‚d rings he armoured him;
<br>his shining shield <b>was</b> scored with runes
<br><b>to</b> ward all wounds <b>and</b> harm from him;
<br>his bow <b>was</b> made <b>of</b> dragon-horn,
<br>his arrows shorn <b>of</b> ebony,
<br><b>of</b> silver <b>was</b> his habergeon,
<br>his scabbard <b>of</b> chalcedony;
<br>his sword <b>of</b> steel <b>was</b> valiant,
<br><b>of</b> adamant his helmet tall,
<br>an eagle-plume upon his crest,
<br>upon his breast an emerald.
<br>
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> Moon <b>and</b> under star
<br>he wandered far from northern strands,
<br>bewildered <b>on</b> enchanted ways
<br>beyond <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> mortal lands.
<br>From gnashing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Narrow Ice
<br>where shadow lies <b>on</b> frozen hills,
<br>from nether heats <b>and</b> burning waste
<br>he turned <b>in</b> haste, <b>and</b> roving still
<br><b>on</b> starless waters far astray
<br>at last he came <b>to</b> Night <b>of</b> Naught,
<br><b>and</b> passed, <b>and</b> never sight he saw
<br><b>of</b> shining shore nor light he sought.
<br>
<br>The winds <b>of</b> wrath came driving him,
<br><b>and</b> blindly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> foam he fled
<br>from west <b>to</b> east <b>and</b> errandless,
<br>unheralded he homeward sped.
<br>
<br>There flying Elwing came <b>to</b> him,
<br><b>and</b> flame <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness lit;
<br>more bright than light <b>of</b> diamond
<br><b>the</b> fire upon <b>her</b> carcanet.
<br>The Silmaril <b>she</b> bound <b>on</b> him
<br><b>and</b> crowned him with <b>the</b> living light
<br><b>and</b> dauntless then with burning brow
<br>he turned his prow; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night
<br>from Otherworld beyond <b>the</b> Sea
<br>there strong <b>and</b> free a storm arose,
<br>a wind <b>of</b> power <b>in</b> Tarmenel;
<br><b>by</b> paths that seldom mortal goes
<br>his boat <b>it</b> bore with biting breath
<br>as might <b>of</b> death across <b>the</b> grey
<br><b>and</b> long-forsaken seas distressed:
<br>from east <b>to</b> west he passed away.
<br>
<br>Through Evernight he back <b>was</b> borne
<br><b>on</b> black <b>and</b> roaring waves that ran
<br>o'er leagues unlit <b>and</b> foundered shores
<br>that drowned before <b>the</b> Days began,
<br>until he heard <b>on</b> strands <b>of</b> pearl
<br>when ends <b>the</b> world <b>the</b> music long,
<br>where ever foaming billows roll
<br><b>the</b> yellow gold <b>and</b> jewels wan.
<br>He saw <b>the</b> Mountain silent rise
<br>where twilight lies upon <b>the</b> knees
<br><b>of</b> Valinor, <b>and</b> Eldamar
<br>beheld afar beyond <b>the</b> seas.
<br>A wanderer escaped from night
<br><b>to</b> haven white he came at last,
<br><b>to</b> Elvenhome <b>the</b> green <b>and</b> fair
<br>where keen <b>the</b> air, where pale as glass
<br>beneath <b>the</b> Hill <b>of</b> Ilmarin
<br>a-glimmer <b>in</b> a valley sheer
<br><b>the</b> lamplit towers <b>of</b> Tirion
<br>are mirrored <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Shadowmere.
<br>
<br>He tarried there from errantry,
<br><b>and</b> melodies they taught <b>to</b> him,
<br><b>and</b> sages old him marvels told,
<br><b>and</b> harps <b>of</b> gold they brought <b>to</b> him.
<br>They clothed him then <b>in</b> elven-white,
<br><b>and</b> seven lights before him sent,
<br>as through <b>the</b> Calacirian
<br><b>to</b> hidden land forlorn he went.
<br>He came unto <b>the</b> timeless halls
<br>where shining fall <b>the</b> countless years,
<br><b>and</b> endless reigns <b>the</b> Elder King
<br><b>in</b> Ilmarin <b>on</b> Mountain sheer;
<br><b>and</b> words unheard were spoken then
<br><b>of</b> folk <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> Elven-kin,
<br>beyond <b>the</b> world were visions showed
<br>forbid <b>to</b> those that dwell therein.
<br>
<br>A ship then new they built for him
<br><b>of</b> mithril <b>and</b> <b>of</b> elven-glass
<br>with shining prow; <b>no</b> shaven oar
<br>nor sail <b>she</b> bore <b>on</b> silver mast:
<br><b>the</b> Silmaril as lantern light
<br><b>and</b> banner bright with living flame
<br><b>to</b> gleam thereon <b>by</b> Elbereth
<br>herself <b>was</b> set, who thither came
<br><b>and</b> wings immortal made for him,
<br><b>and</b> laid <b>on</b> him undying doom,
<br><b>to</b> sail <b>the</b> shoreless skies <b>and</b> come
<br>behind <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> light <b>of</b> Moon.
<br>
<br>From Evereven's lofty hills
<br>where softly silver fountains fall
<br>his wings him bore, a wandering light,
<br>beyond <b>the</b> mighty Mountain Wall.
<br>From World's End then he turned away
<br><b>and</b> yearned again <b>to</b> find afar
<br>his home through shadows journeying,
<br><b>and</b> burning as an island star
<br><b>on</b> high above <b>the</b> mists he came,
<br>a distant flame before <b>the</b> Sun,
<br>a wonder ere <b>the</b> waking dawn
<br>where grey <b>the</b> Norland waters run.
<br>
<br>And over Middle-earth he passed
<br><b>and</b> heard at last <b>the</b> weeping sore
<br><b>of</b> women <b>and</b> <b>of</b> elven-maids
<br><b>in</b> Elder Days, <b>in</b> years <b>of</b> yore.
<br>gut <b>on</b> him mighty doom <b>was</b> laid,
<br>till Moon should fade, an orb‚d star
<br><b>to</b> pass, <b>and</b> tarry never more
<br><b>on</b> Hither Shores where mortals are;
<br>for ever still a herald <b>on</b>
<br>an errand that should never rest
<br><b>to</b> bear his shining lamp afar,
<br><b>the</b> Flammifer <b>of</b> Westernesse.
<br>   
<br>   The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes <b>and</b> saw that Bilbo <b>was</b> seated <b>on</b> his stool <b>in</b> a circle <b>of</b> listeners, who were smiling <b>and</b> applauding.
<br>   “Now we <b>had</b> better have <b>it</b> again,” said an Elf.
<br>   Bilbo got up <b>and</b> bowed. “<b>I</b> am flattered, Lindir,” he said. “But <b>it</b> would be too tiring <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b> all.”
<br>   “Not too tiring for you,” <b>the</b> Elves answered laughing. “You know you are never <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer your question at one hearing!”
<br>   “What!” cried Bilbo. “You can't tell which parts were mine, <b>and</b> which were <b>the</b> D?nadan's?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> not easy for us <b>to</b> tell <b>the</b> difference between two mortals” said <b>the</b> Elf.
<br>   “Nonsense, Lindir,” snorted Bilbo. “If you can't distinguish between a Man <b>and</b> a Hobbit, your judgement <b>is</b> poorer than <b>I</b> imagined. They're as different as peas <b>and</b> apples.”
<br>   “Maybe. To sheep other sheep <b>no</b> doubt appear different,” laughed Lindir. “Or <b>to</b> shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other business.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> won't argue with you,” said Bilbo. “<b>I</b> am sleepy after so much music <b>and</b> singing. <b>I</b>'ll leave you <b>to</b> guess, if you want <b>to</b>.”
<br>   He got up <b>and</b> came towards Frodo. “Well, that's over,” he said <b>in</b> a low voice. “It went off better than <b>I</b> expected. <b>I</b> don't often <b>get</b> asked for a second hearing. What did you think <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am not going <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> guess,” said Frodo smiling.
<br>   “You needn't,” said Bilbo. “As a matter <b>of</b> fact <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all mine. Except that Aragorn insisted <b>on</b> my putting <b>in</b> a green stone. He seemed <b>to</b> think <b>it</b> important. <b>I</b> don't know why. Otherwise he obviously <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> whole thing rather above my head, <b>and</b> he said that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> cheek <b>to</b> make verses about E?rendil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my affair. <b>I</b> suppose he <b>was</b> right.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know,” said Frodo. “It seemed <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> fit somehow, though <b>I</b> can't explain. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> half asleep when you began, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> follow <b>on</b> from something that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dreaming about. <b>I</b> didn't understand that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really you speaking until near <b>the</b> end.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> difficult <b>to</b> keep awake here, until you <b>get</b> used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>;” said Bilbo. “Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite <b>the</b> elvish appetite for music <b>and</b> poetry <b>and</b> tales. They seem <b>to</b> like them as much as food, <b>or</b> more. They will be going <b>on</b> for a long time yet. What <b>do</b> you say <b>to</b> slipping off for some more quiet talk?”
<br>   “Can we?” said Frodo.
<br>   “Of course. This <b>is</b> merrymaking not business. Come <b>and</b> go as you like, as long as you don't make a noise.”
<br>   They got up <b>and</b> withdrew quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows, <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile <b>on</b> his face. In spite <b>of</b> his delight <b>in</b> Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug <b>of</b> regret as they passed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire. Even as they stepped over <b>the</b> threshold a single clear voice rose <b>in</b> song.
<br>   
<br>A Elbereth Gilthoniel,
<br>silivren penna m?riel
<br>o menel aglar elenath!
<br>Na-chaered palan-d?riel
<br>o galadhremmin ennorath,
<br>Fanuilos, le linnathon
<br>nef aear, s? nef aearon!
<br>   
<br>   Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>was</b> <b>on</b> his face like summer-light upon <b>the</b> trees. Near him sat <b>the</b> Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside <b>her</b>; his dark cloak <b>was</b> thrown back, <b>and</b> he seemed <b>to</b> be clad <b>in</b> elven-mail, <b>and</b> a star shone <b>on</b> his breast. They spoke together, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes fell <b>on</b> him from afar <b>and</b> pierced his heart.
<br>   He stood still enchanted, while <b>the</b> sweet syllables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elvish song fell like clear jewels <b>of</b> blended word <b>and</b> melody. “It <b>is</b> a song <b>to</b> Elbereth,” said Bilbo. “They will sing that, <b>and</b> other songs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>   He led Frodo back <b>to</b> his own little room. It opened <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gar dens <b>and</b> looked south across <b>the</b> ravine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bruinen. There they sat for some while, looking through <b>the</b> window at <b>the</b> bright stars above <b>the</b> steep-climbing woods, <b>and</b> talking softly. They spoke <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire far away, nor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark shadows <b>and</b> perils that encompassed them, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fair things they <b>had</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world together, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars, <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gentle fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bright year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods.
<br>   At last there came a knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. “Begging your pardon,” said Sam, putting <b>in</b> his head, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just wondering if you would be wanting anything.”
<br>   “And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,” replied Bilbo. “<b>I</b> guess you mean that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time your master went <b>to</b> bed.”
<br>   “Well, sir, there <b>is</b> a Council early tomorrow, <b>I</b> hear <b>and</b> he only got up today for <b>the</b> first time.”
<br>   “Quite right, Sam,” laughed Bilbo. “You can trot off <b>and</b> tell Gandalf that he has gone <b>to</b> bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has been good <b>to</b> see you again! There are <b>no</b> folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk. <b>I</b> am getting <b>very</b> old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> began <b>to</b> wonder if <b>I</b> should ever live <b>to</b> see your chapters <b>of</b> our story. Good night! <b>I</b>'ll take a walk, <b>I</b> think, <b>and</b> look at <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> Elbereth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden. Sleep well!”
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 2
<br><b>THE</b> COUNCIL OF ELROND
<br>
<br>   Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed <b>and</b> well. He walked along <b>the</b> terraces above <b>the</b> loud-flowing Bruinen <b>and</b> watched <b>the</b> pale, cool sun rise above <b>the</b> far mountains, <b>and</b> shine down. Slanting through <b>the</b> thin silver mist; <b>the</b> dew upon <b>the</b> yellow leaves <b>was</b> glimmering, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> woven nets <b>of</b> gossamer twinkled <b>on</b> every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying <b>nothing</b>. <b>but</b> sniffing <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> looking every now <b>and</b> again with wonder <b>in</b> his eyes at <b>the</b> great heights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East. The snow <b>was</b> white upon their peaks.
<br>   On a seat cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stone beside a turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> path they came upon Gandalf <b>and</b> Bilbo deep <b>in</b> talk. “Hullo! Good morning!” said Bilbo. “Feel ready for <b>the</b> great council?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> feel ready for anything,” answered Frodo. “But most <b>of</b> all <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> go walking today <b>and</b> explore <b>the</b> valley. <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> those pine-woods up there.” He pointed away far up <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north.
<br>   “You may have a chance later,” said Gandalf. “But we cannot make any plans yet. There <b>is</b> much <b>to</b> hear <b>and</b> decide today.”
<br>   Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> warning bell for <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Elrond,” cried Gandalf. “Come along now! Both you <b>and</b> Bilbo are wanted.”
<br>   Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo followed <b>the</b> wizard quickly along <b>the</b> winding path back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house; behind them, uninvited <b>and</b> for <b>the</b> moment forgotten, trotted Sam.
<br>   Gandalf led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porch where Frodo <b>had</b> found his friends <b>the</b> evening before. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clear autumn morning <b>was</b> now glowing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley. The noise <b>of</b> bubbling waters came up from <b>the</b> foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, <b>and</b> a wholesome peace lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land. To Frodo his dangerous flight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rumours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world outside, already seemed only <b>the</b> memories <b>of</b> a troubled dream; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> faces that were turned <b>to</b> meet them as they entered were grave.
<br>   Elrond <b>was</b> there, <b>and</b> several others were seated <b>in</b> silence about him. Frodo saw Glorfindel <b>and</b> Gl?<b>in</b>; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> a corner alone Strider <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b>, clad <b>in</b> his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo <b>to</b> a seat <b>by</b> his side, <b>and</b> presented him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company, saying:
<br>   “Here, my friends <b>is</b> <b>the</b> hobbit, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater peril <b>or</b> <b>on</b> an errand more urgent.”
<br>   He then pointed out <b>and</b> named those whom Frodo <b>had</b> not met before. There <b>was</b> a younger dwarf at Gl?<b>in</b>'s side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors <b>of</b> Elrond's household, <b>of</b> whom Erestor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> chief; <b>and</b> with him <b>was</b> Galdor, an Elf from <b>the</b> Grey Havens who <b>had</b> come <b>on</b> an errand from C?rdan <b>the</b> Shipwright. There <b>was</b> also a strange Elf clad <b>in</b> green <b>and</b> brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart <b>was</b> a tall man with a fair <b>and</b> noble face, dark-haired <b>and</b> grey-eyed, proud <b>and</b> stern <b>of</b> glance.
<br>   He <b>was</b> cloaked <b>and</b> booted as if for a journey <b>on</b> horseback; <b>and</b> indeed though his garments were rich, <b>and</b> his cloak <b>was</b> lined with fur, they were stained with long travel. He <b>had</b> a collar <b>of</b> silver <b>in</b> which a single white stone <b>was</b> set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now <b>was</b> laid upon his knees. He gazed at Frodo <b>and</b> Bilbo with sudden wonder.
<br>   “Here,” said Elrond, turning <b>to</b> Gandalf, “<b>is</b> Boromir, a man from <b>the</b> South. He arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grey morning, <b>and</b> seeks for counsel. <b>I</b> have bidden him <b>to</b> be present, for here his questions will be answered.”
<br>   Not all that <b>was</b> spoken <b>and</b> debated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Council need now be told. Much <b>was</b> said <b>of</b> events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world outside, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide lands east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains. Of these things Frodo <b>had</b> already heard many rumours; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b> <b>was</b> new <b>to</b> him, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid <b>the</b> splendour <b>of</b> their works <b>of</b> hand <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain were troubled.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> now many years ago,” said Gl?<b>in</b>, “that a shadow <b>of</b> disquiet fell upon our people. Whence <b>it</b> came we did not at first perceive. Words began <b>to</b> be whispered <b>in</b> secret: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said that we were hemmed <b>in</b> a narrow place, <b>and</b> that greater wealth <b>and</b> splendour would be found <b>in</b> a wider world. Some spoke <b>of</b> Moria: <b>the</b> mighty works <b>of</b> our fathers that are called <b>in</b> our own tongue Khazad-d?m; <b>and</b> they declared that now at last we <b>had</b> <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> numbers <b>to</b> return.”
<br>   Gl?<b>in</b> sighed. “Moria! Moria! Wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern world! Too deep we delved there, <b>and</b> woke <b>the</b> nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> Durin fled. But now we spoke <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again with longing, <b>and</b> yet with dread; for <b>no</b> dwarf has dared <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Khazad-d?m for many lives <b>of</b> kings, save Thr?r only, <b>and</b> he perished. At last, however, Balin listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whispers, <b>and</b> resolved <b>to</b> go; <b>and</b> though D?<b>in</b> did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori <b>and</b> ?<b>in</b> <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> our folk, <b>and</b> they went away south.
<br>   "That <b>was</b> nigh <b>on</b> thirty years ago. For a while we <b>had</b> news <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed good: messages reported that Moria <b>had</b> been entered <b>and</b> a great work begun there. Then there <b>was</b> silence, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> word has ever come from Moria since.
<br>   "Then about a year ago a messenger came <b>to</b> D?<b>in</b>, <b>but</b> not from Moria—from Mordor: a horseman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night, who called D?<b>in</b> <b>to</b> his gate. The Lord Sauron <b>the</b> Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would give for <b>it</b>, such as he gave <b>of</b> old. And he asked urgently concerning hobbits, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> kind they were, <b>and</b> where they dwelt. “For Sauron knows,” said he, “that one <b>of</b> these <b>was</b> known <b>to</b> you <b>on</b> a time."
<br>   “At this we were greatly troubled, <b>and</b> we gave <b>no</b> answer. And then his fell voice <b>was</b> lowered, <b>and</b> he would have sweetened <b>it</b> if he could. “As a small token only <b>of</b> your friendship Sauron asks this,” he said: “that you should find this thief,” such <b>was</b> his word, “<b>and</b> <b>get</b> from him, willing <b>or</b> <b>no</b>, a little ring, <b>the</b> least <b>of</b> rings, that <b>once</b> he stole. It <b>is</b> <b>but</b> a trifle that Sauron fancies, <b>and</b> an earnest <b>of</b> your good will. Find <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> three rings that <b>the</b> Dwarf sires possessed <b>of</b> old shall be returned <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thief, whether he still lives <b>and</b> where, <b>and</b> you shall have great reward <b>and</b> lasting friendship from <b>the</b> Lord. Refuse, <b>and</b> things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?"
<br>   “At that his breath came like <b>the</b> hiss <b>of</b> snakes, <b>and</b> all who stood <b>by</b> shuddered, <b>but</b> D?<b>in</b> said: “<b>I</b> say neither yea nor nay. <b>I</b> must consider this message <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means under its fair cloak."
<br>   “Consider well, <b>but</b> not too long,” said he.
<br>   “The time <b>of</b> my <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> my own <b>to</b> spend,” answered D?<b>in</b>.
<br>   “For <b>the</b> present,” said he, <b>and</b> rode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   “Heavy have <b>the</b> hearts <b>of</b> our chieftains been since that night. We needed not <b>the</b> fell voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> messenger <b>to</b> warn us that his words held both menace <b>and</b> deceit; for we knew already that <b>the</b> power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, <b>and</b> ever <b>it</b> betrayed us <b>of</b> old. Twice <b>the</b> messenger has returned, <b>and</b> has gone unanswered. The third <b>and</b> last time, so he says, <b>is</b> soon <b>to</b> come, before <b>the</b> ending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year.
<br>   “And so <b>I</b> have been sent at last <b>by</b> D?<b>in</b> <b>to</b> warn Bilbo that he <b>is</b> sought <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this least <b>of</b> rings. Also we crave <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Elrond. For <b>the</b> Shadow grows <b>and</b> draws nearer. We discover that messengers have come also <b>to</b> King Brand <b>in</b> Dale, <b>and</b> that he <b>is</b> afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war <b>is</b> gathering <b>on</b> his eastern borders. If we make <b>no</b> answer, <b>the</b> Enemy may move Men <b>of</b> his rule <b>to</b> assail King Brand, <b>and</b> D?<b>in</b> also.”
<br>   “You have done well <b>to</b> come,” said Elrond. “You will hear today all that you need <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> understand <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. There <b>is</b> naught that you can <b>do</b>, other than <b>to</b> resist, with hope <b>or</b> <b>without</b> <b>it</b>. But you <b>do</b> not stand alone. You will learn that your trouble <b>is</b> <b>but</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> western world. The Ring! What shall we <b>do</b> with <b>the</b> Ring, <b>the</b> least <b>of</b> rings, <b>the</b> trifle that Sauron fancies? That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> doom that we must deem.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> purpose for which you are called hither. Called, <b>I</b> say. though <b>I</b> have not called you <b>to</b> me, strangers from distant lands. You have come <b>and</b> are here met, <b>in</b> this <b>very</b> nick <b>of</b> time, <b>by</b> chance as <b>it</b> may seem. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not so. Believe rather that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so ordered that we, who sit here, <b>and</b> none others, must now find counsel for <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.
<br>   “Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all <b>but</b> a few until this day. And first, so that all may understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> peril, <b>the</b> Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring shall be told from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> even <b>to</b> this present. And <b>I</b> will begin that tale, though others shall end <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Then all listened while Elrond <b>in</b> his clear voice spoke <b>of</b> Sauron <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rings <b>of</b> Power, <b>and</b> their forging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world long ago. A part <b>of</b> his tale <b>was</b> known <b>to</b> some there, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> full tale <b>to</b> none, <b>and</b> many eyes were turned t= Elrond <b>in</b> fear <b>and</b> wonder as he told <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-smiths <b>of</b> Eregion <b>and</b> their friendship with Moria, <b>and</b> their eagerness for knowledge, <b>by</b> which Sauron ensnared them. For <b>in</b> that time he <b>was</b> not yet evil <b>to</b> behold, <b>and</b> they received his aid <b>and</b> grew mighty <b>in</b> craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, <b>and</b> betrayed them, <b>and</b> forged secretly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mountain <b>of</b> Fire <b>the</b> One Ring <b>to</b> be their master. But Celebrimbor <b>was</b> aware <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> hid <b>the</b> Three which he <b>had</b> made; <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> war, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> land <b>was</b> laid waste, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate <b>of</b> Moria <b>was</b> shut.
<br>   Then through all <b>the</b> years that followed he traced <b>the</b> Ring; <b>but</b> since that history <b>is</b> elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set <b>it</b> down <b>in</b> his books <b>of</b> lore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not here recalled. For <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a long tale, full <b>of</b> deeds great <b>and</b> terrible, <b>and</b> briefly though Elrond spoke, <b>the</b> sun rode up <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>was</b> passing ere he ceased.
<br>   Of N?menor he spoke, its glory <b>and</b> its fall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men <b>to</b> Middle-earth out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, borne upon <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> storm. Then Elendil <b>the</b> Tall <b>and</b> his mighty sons, Isildur <b>and</b> An?rion, became great lords; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> North-realm they made <b>in</b> Arnor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South-realm <b>in</b> Gondor above <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> Anduin. But Sauron <b>of</b> Mordor assailed them, <b>and</b> they made <b>the</b> Last Alliance <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> Elendil were mustered <b>in</b> Arnor.
<br>   Thereupon Elrond paused a while <b>and</b> sighed. “<b>I</b> remember well <b>the</b> splendour <b>of</b> their banners,” he said. “It recalled <b>to</b> me <b>the</b> glory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Beleriand, so many great princes <b>and</b> captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim <b>was</b> broken, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves deemed that evil <b>was</b> ended for ever, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not so.”
<br>   “You remember?” said Frodo, speaking his <b>thought</b> aloud <b>in</b> his astonishment. “But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b>,” he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>was</b> a long age ago.”
<br>   “So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> indeed,” answered Elrond gravely. “But my memory reaches back even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days. E?rendil <b>was</b> my sire, who <b>was</b> born <b>in</b> Gondolin before its fall; <b>and</b> my mother <b>was</b> Elwing, daughter <b>of</b> Dior, son <b>of</b> L?thien <b>of</b> Doriath. <b>I</b> have seen three ages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>and</b> many defeats, <b>and</b> many fruitless victories.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> herald <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> marched with his host. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Dagorlad before <b>the</b> Black Gate <b>of</b> Mordor, where we <b>had</b> <b>the</b> mastery: for <b>the</b> Spear <b>of</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil, Aiglos <b>and</b> Narsil, none could withstand. <b>I</b> beheld <b>the</b> last combat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, <b>and</b> Elendil fell, <b>and</b> Narsil broke beneath him; <b>but</b> Sauron himself <b>was</b> overthrown, <b>and</b> Isildur cut <b>the</b> Ring from his hand with <b>the</b> hilt-shard <b>of</b> his father's sword, <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> for his own.”
<br>   At this <b>the</b> stranger, Boromir, broke <b>in</b>. “So that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> became <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring!” he cried. “If ever such a tale <b>was</b> told <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>it</b> has long been forgotten. <b>I</b> have heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Ring <b>of</b> him that we <b>do</b> not name; <b>but</b> we believed that <b>it</b> perished from <b>the</b> world <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> his first realm. Isildur took <b>it</b>! That <b>is</b> tidings indeed.”
<br>   “Alas! yes,” said Elrond. “Isildur took <b>it</b>, as should not have been. It should have been cast then <b>into</b> Orodruin's fire nigh at hand where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made. But few marked <b>what</b> Isildur did. He alone stood <b>by</b> his father <b>in</b> that last mortal contest; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> Gil-galad only C?rdan stood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>. But Isildur would not listen <b>to</b> our counsel.
<br>   “This <b>I</b> will have as weregild for my father, <b>and</b> my brother,” he said; <b>and</b> therefore whether we would <b>or</b> <b>no</b>, he took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> treasure <b>it</b>. But soon he <b>was</b> betrayed <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his death; <b>and</b> so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> named <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Isildur's Bane. Yet death maybe <b>was</b> better than <b>what</b> else might have befallen him.
<br>   “Only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North did these tidings come, <b>and</b> only <b>to</b> a few. Small wonder <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that you have not heard them, Boromir. From <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over <b>the</b> mountains after long wandering. One <b>of</b> these <b>was</b> Ohtar, <b>the</b> esquire <b>of</b> Isildur, who bore <b>the</b> shards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword <b>of</b> Elendil; <b>and</b> he brought them <b>to</b> Valandil, <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur, who being <b>but</b> a child <b>had</b> remained here <b>in</b> Rivendell. But Narsil <b>was</b> broken <b>and</b> its light extinguished, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> has not yet been forged again.
<br>   “Fruitless did <b>I</b> call <b>the</b> victory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet <b>it</b> did not achieve its end. Sauron <b>was</b> diminished, <b>but</b> not destroyed. His Ring <b>was</b> lost <b>but</b> not unmade. The Dark Tower <b>was</b> broken, <b>but</b> its foundations were not removed; for they were made with <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> while <b>it</b> remains they will endure. Many Elves <b>and</b> many mighty Men, <b>and</b> many <b>of</b> their friends. <b>had</b> perished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. An?rion <b>was</b> slain, <b>and</b> Isildur <b>was</b> slain; <b>and</b> Gil-galad <b>and</b> Elendil were <b>no</b> more. Never again shall there be any such league <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men; for Men multiply <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Firstborn decrease, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that day <b>the</b> race <b>of</b> N?menor has decayed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> span <b>of</b> their years has lessened.
<br>   “In <b>the</b> North after <b>the</b> war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> slaughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Westernesse were diminished, <b>and</b> their city <b>of</b> Ann?minas beside Lake Evendim fell <b>into</b> ruin; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Valandil removed <b>and</b> dwelt at Fornost <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high North Downs, <b>and</b> that now too <b>is</b> desolate. Men call <b>it</b> Deadmen's Dike, <b>and</b> they fear <b>to</b> tread there. For <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Arnor dwindled, <b>and</b> their foes devoured them, <b>and</b> their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grassy hills.
<br>   “In <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Gondor long endured; <b>and</b> for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> might <b>of</b> N?menor, ere <b>it</b> fell. High towers that people built, <b>and</b> strong places. <b>and</b> havens <b>of</b> many ships; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> winged crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men <b>was</b> held <b>in</b> awe <b>by</b> folk <b>of</b> many tongues. Their chief city <b>was</b> Osgiliath, Citadel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stars. through <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow; <b>and</b> westward at <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Setting Sun. There <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King grew a white tree, from <b>the</b> seed <b>of</b> that tree which Isildur brought over <b>the</b> deep waters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seed <b>of</b> that tree before came from Eress?a, <b>and</b> before that out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uttermost West <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Day before days when <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> young.
<br>   “But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swift years <b>of</b> Middle-earth <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> Meneldil son <b>of</b> An?rion failed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tree withered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> N?menoreans became mingled with that <b>of</b> lesser men. Then <b>the</b> watch upon <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> Mordor slept, <b>and</b> dark things crept back <b>to</b> Gorgoroth. And <b>on</b> a time evil things came forth, <b>and</b> they took Minas Ithil <b>and</b> abode <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> they made <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a place <b>of</b> dread; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called Minas Morgul, <b>the</b> Tower <b>of</b> Sorcery. Then Minas Anor <b>was</b> named anew Minas Tirith, <b>the</b> Tower <b>of</b> Guard; <b>and</b> these two cities were ever at war, <b>but</b> Osgiliath which lay between <b>was</b> deserted <b>and</b> <b>in</b> its ruins shadows walked.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> has been for many lives <b>of</b> men. But <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> Minas Tirith still fight <b>on</b>, defying our enemies, keeping <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River from Argonath <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea. And now that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale that <b>I</b> shall tell <b>is</b> drawn <b>to</b> its close. For <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Isildur <b>the</b> Ruling Ring passed out <b>of</b> all knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Three were released from its dominion. But now <b>in</b> this latter day they are <b>in</b> peril <b>once</b> more, for <b>to</b> our sorrow <b>the</b> One has been found. Others shall speak <b>of</b> its finding, for <b>in</b> that <b>I</b> played small part.”
<br>   He ceased, <b>but</b> at <b>once</b> Boromir stood up, tall <b>and</b> proud, before them. Give me leave, Master Elrond, said he, first <b>to</b> say more <b>of</b> Gondor; for verily from <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Gondor <b>I</b> am come. And <b>it</b> would be well for all <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> passes there. For few, <b>I</b> deem, know <b>of</b> our deeds, <b>and</b> therefore guess little <b>of</b> their peril, if we should fail at last.
<br>   “Believe not that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Gondor <b>the</b> blood <b>of</b> N?menor <b>is</b> spent, nor all its pride <b>and</b> dignity forgotten. By our valour <b>the</b> wild folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East are still restrained, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> Morgul kept at bay; <b>and</b> thus alone are peace <b>and</b> freedom maintained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lands behind us, bulwark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. But if <b>the</b> passages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River should be won, <b>what</b> then?
<br>   “Yet that hour, maybe, <b>is</b> not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has arisen again. Smoke rises <b>once</b> more from Orodruin that we call Mount Doom. The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Land grows <b>and</b> we are hard beset. When <b>the</b> Enemy returned our folk were driven from Ithilien, our fair domain east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, though we kept a foothold there <b>and</b> strength <b>of</b> arms. But this <b>very</b> year, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> June, sudden war came upon us out <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> we were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with <b>the</b> Easterlings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cruel Haradrim; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>by</b> numbers that we were defeated. A power <b>was</b> there that we have not felt before.
<br>   “Some said that <b>it</b> could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark shadow under <b>the</b> moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, <b>but</b> fear fell <b>on</b> our boldest, so that horse <b>and</b> man gave way <b>and</b> fled. Only a remnant <b>of</b> our eastern force came back, destroying <b>the</b> last bridge that still stood amid <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Osgiliath.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company that held <b>the</b> bridge, until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> cast down behind us. Four only were saved <b>by</b> swimming: my brother <b>and</b> myself <b>and</b> two others. But still we fight <b>on</b>, holding all <b>the</b> west shores <b>of</b> Anduin; <b>and</b> those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much praise <b>but</b> little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride <b>to</b> us when we call.
<br>   “In this evil hour <b>I</b> have come <b>on</b> an errand over many dangerous leagues <b>to</b> Elrond: a hundred <b>and</b> ten days <b>I</b> have journeyed all alone. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not seek allies <b>in</b> war. The might <b>of</b> Elrond <b>is</b> <b>in</b> wisdom not <b>in</b> weapons, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said. <b>I</b> come <b>to</b> ask for counsel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unravelling <b>of</b> hard words. For <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sudden assault a dream came <b>to</b> my brother <b>in</b> a troubled sleep; <b>and</b> afterwards a like dream came oft <b>to</b> him again, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>to</b> me.
<br>   “In that dream <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> eastern sky grew dark <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a growing thunder, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West a pale light lingered, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>I</b> heard a voice, remote <b>but</b> clear, crying:
<br>   
<br>Seek for <b>the</b> Sword that <b>was</b> broken:
<br>In Imladris <b>it</b> dwells;
<br>There shall be counsels taken
<br>Stronger than Morgul-spells.
<br>There shall be shown a token
<br>That Doom <b>is</b> near at hand,
<br>For Isildur's Bane shall waken,
<br>And <b>the</b> Halfling forth shall stand.
<br>   
<br>   Of these words we could understand little, <b>and</b> we spoke <b>to</b> our father, Denethor, Lord <b>of</b> Minas Tirith, wise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> Gondor. This only would he say, that Imladris <b>was</b> <b>of</b> old <b>the</b> name among <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> a far northern dale, where Elrond <b>the</b> Halfelven dwelt, greatest <b>of</b> lore-masters. Therefore my brother, seeing how desperate <b>was</b> our need, <b>was</b> eager <b>to</b> heed <b>the</b> dream <b>and</b> seek for Imladris; <b>but</b> since <b>the</b> way <b>was</b> full <b>of</b> doubt <b>and</b> danger, <b>I</b> took <b>the</b> journey upon myself. Loth <b>was</b> my father <b>to</b> give me leave, <b>and</b> long have <b>I</b> wandered <b>by</b> roads forgotten, seeking <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>of</b> which many <b>had</b> heard, <b>but</b> few knew where <b>it</b> lay.”
<br>   “And here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond more shall be made clear <b>to</b> you” said Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon <b>the</b> table that stood before Elrond, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blade <b>was</b> <b>in</b> two pieces. “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sword that <b>was</b> Broken!” he said.
<br>   “And who are you, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> have you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Minas Tirith?” asked Boromir, looking <b>in</b> wonder at <b>the</b> lean face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ranger <b>and</b> his weather-stained cloak.
<br>   “He <b>is</b> Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn,” said Elrond; “<b>and</b> he <b>is</b> descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son <b>of</b> Minas Ithil. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> few are now left <b>of</b> that folk.”
<br>   “Then <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> you, <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> me at all!” cried Frodo <b>in</b> amazement, springing <b>to</b> his feet, as if he expected <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> be demanded at <b>once</b>.
<br>   “It does not belong <b>to</b> either <b>of</b> us,” said Aragorn; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> has been ordained that you should hold <b>it</b> for a while.”
<br>   “Bring out <b>the</b> Ring, Frodo!” said Gandalf solemnly. “The time has come. Hold <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> then Boromir will understand <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> his riddle.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a hush, <b>and</b> all turned their eyes <b>on</b> Frodo. He <b>was</b> shaken <b>by</b> a sudden shame <b>and</b> fear; <b>and</b> he felt a great reluctance <b>to</b> reveal <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> a loathing <b>of</b> its touch. He wished he <b>was</b> far away. The Ring gleamed <b>and</b> flickered as he held <b>it</b> up before them <b>in</b> his trembling hand.
<br>   “Behold Isildur's Bane!” said Elrond.
<br>   Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at <b>the</b> golden thing. “The Halfling!” he muttered. “Is then <b>the</b> doom <b>of</b> Minas Tirith come at last? But why then should we seek a broken sword?”
<br>   “The words were not <b>the</b> doom <b>of</b> Minas Tirith,” said Aragorn. “But doom <b>and</b> great deeds are indeed at hand. For <b>the</b> Sword that <b>was</b> Broken <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured <b>by</b> his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> spoken <b>of</b> old among us that <b>it</b> should be made again when <b>the</b> Ring, Isildur's Bane, <b>was</b> found. Now you have seen <b>the</b> sword that you have sought, <b>what</b> would you ask? Do you wish for <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elendil <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Gondor?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> not sent <b>to</b> beg any boon, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> seek only <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> a riddle,” answered Boromir proudly. “Yet we are hard pressed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sword <b>of</b> Elendil would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed return out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past.” He looked again at Aragorn, <b>and</b> doubt <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.
<br>   Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he <b>was</b> annoyed <b>on</b> his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out:
<br>   
<br>All that <b>is</b> gold does not glitter,
<br>Not all those who wander are lost;
<br>The old that <b>is</b> strong does not wither,
<br>Deep roots are not reached <b>by</b> <b>the</b> frost.
<br>
<br>From <b>the</b> ashes a fire shall be woken,
<br>A light from <b>the</b> shadows shall spring;
<br>Renewed shall be blade that <b>was</b> broken:
<br>The crownless again shall be king.
<br>   
<br>   “Not <b>very</b> good perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point—if you need more beyond <b>the</b> word <b>of</b> Elrond. If that <b>was</b> worth a journey <b>of</b> a hundred <b>and</b> ten days <b>to</b> hear, you <b>had</b> best listen <b>to</b> <b>it</b>.” He sat down with a snort.
<br>   “<b>I</b> made that up myself,” he whispered <b>to</b> Frodo, “for <b>the</b> D?nadan, a long time ago when he first told me about himself. <b>I</b> almost wish that my adventures were not over, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> could go with him when his day comes.”
<br>   Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned <b>to</b> Boromir again. “For my part <b>I</b> forgive your doubt,” he said. “Little <b>do</b> <b>I</b> resemble <b>the</b> figures <b>of</b> Elendil <b>and</b> Isildur as they stand carven <b>in</b> their majesty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> Denethor. <b>I</b> am <b>but</b> <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur, not Isildur himself. <b>I</b> have <b>had</b> a hard life <b>and</b> a long; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leagues that lie between here <b>and</b> Gondor are a small part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> my journeys. <b>I</b> have crossed many mountains <b>and</b> many rivers, <b>and</b> trodden many plains, even <b>into</b> <b>the</b> far countries <b>of</b> Rh?n <b>and</b> Harad where <b>the</b> stars are strange.
<br>   “But my home, such as <b>I</b> have, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North. For here <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Valandil have ever dwelt <b>in</b> long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations. Our days have darkened, <b>and</b> we have dwindled; <b>but</b> ever <b>the</b> Sword has passed <b>to</b> a new keeper. And this <b>I</b> will say <b>to</b> you, Boromir, ere <b>I</b> end. Lonely men are we, Rangers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wild, hunters—<b>but</b> hunters ever <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy; for they are found <b>in</b> many places, not <b>in</b> Mordor only.
<br>   “If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls <b>and</b> bright swords <b>do</b> not stay. You know little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands beyond your bounds. Peace <b>and</b> freedom, <b>do</b> you say? The North would have known them little <b>but</b> for us. Fear would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from <b>the</b> houseless hills, <b>or</b> creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare <b>to</b> tread, <b>what</b> safety would there be <b>in</b> quiet lands, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homes <b>of</b> simple men at night, if <b>the</b> D?nedain were asleep, <b>or</b> were all gone <b>into</b> <b>the</b> grave?
<br>   “And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, <b>and</b> countrymen give us scornful names. “Strider” <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> one fat man who lives within a day's march <b>of</b> foes that would freeze his heart <b>or</b> lay his little town <b>in</b> ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have <b>it</b> otherwise. If simple folk are free from care <b>and</b> fear, simple they will be, <b>and</b> we must be secret <b>to</b> keep them so. That has been <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> my kindred, while <b>the</b> years have lengthened <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass has grown.
<br>   “But now <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> changing <b>once</b> again. A new hour comes. Isildur's Bane <b>is</b> found. Battle <b>is</b> at hand. The Sword shall be reforged. <b>I</b> will come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith.”
<br>   “Isildur's Bane <b>is</b> found, you say,” said Boromir. “<b>I</b> have seen a bright ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Halfling's hand; <b>but</b> Isildur perished ere this age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world began, they say. How <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Wise know that this ring <b>is</b> his? And how has <b>it</b> passed down <b>the</b> years, until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> brought hither <b>by</b> so strange a messenger?”
<br>   “That shall be told,” said Elrond.
<br>   “But not yet, <b>I</b> beg, Master!” said Bilbo. “Already <b>the</b> Sun <b>is</b> climbing <b>to</b> noon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> something <b>to</b> strengthen me.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> not named you,” said Elrond smiling. “But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story <b>into</b> verse, you may tell <b>it</b> <b>in</b> plain words. The briefer, <b>the</b> sooner shall you be refreshed.”
<br>   “Very well,” said Bilbo. “<b>I</b> will <b>do</b> as you bid. But <b>I</b> will now tell <b>the</b> true story, <b>and</b> if some here have heard me tell <b>it</b> otherwise”—he looked sidelong at Gl?<b>in</b>—`<b>I</b> ask them <b>to</b> forget <b>it</b> <b>and</b> forgive me. <b>I</b> only wished <b>to</b> claim <b>the</b> treasure as my <b>very</b> own <b>in</b> those days, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> thief that <b>was</b> put <b>on</b> me. But perhaps <b>I</b> understand things a little better now. Anyway, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened.”
<br>   To some there Bilbo's tale <b>was</b> wholly new, <b>and</b> they listened with amazement while <b>the</b> old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account <b>of</b> his party <b>and</b> disappearance from <b>the</b> Shire, if he <b>had</b> been allowed; <b>but</b> Elrond raised his hand.
<br>   “Well told, my friend,” he said, “<b>but</b> that <b>is</b> enough at this time. For <b>the</b> moment <b>it</b> suffices <b>to</b> know that <b>the</b> Ring passed <b>to</b> Frodo, your heir. Let him now speak!”
<br>   Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told <b>of</b> all his dealings with <b>the</b> Ring from <b>the</b> day that <b>it</b> passed <b>into</b> his keeping. Every step <b>of</b> his journey from Hobbiton <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen <b>was</b> questioned <b>and</b> considered, <b>and</b> everything that he could recall concerning <b>the</b> Black Riders <b>was</b> examined. At last he sat down again.
<br>   “Not bad,” Bilbo said <b>to</b> him. “You would have made a good story <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, if they hadn't kept <b>on</b> interrupting. <b>I</b> tried <b>to</b> make a few notes, <b>but</b> we shall have <b>to</b> go over <b>it</b> all again together some time, if <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> write <b>it</b> up. There are whole chapters <b>of</b> stuff before you ever got here!”
<br>   “Yes, <b>it</b> made quite a long tale,” answered Frodo. “But <b>the</b> story still does not seem complete <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> still want <b>to</b> know a good deal, especially about Gandalf.”
<br>   Galdor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Havens, who sat near <b>by</b>, overheard him. “You speak for me also,” he cried, <b>and</b> turning <b>to</b> Elrond he said: “The Wise may have good reason <b>to</b> believe that <b>the</b> halfling's trove <b>is</b> indeed <b>the</b> Great Ring <b>of</b> long debate, unlikely though that may seem <b>to</b> those who know less. But may we not hear <b>the</b> proofs? And <b>I</b> would ask this also. What <b>of</b> Saruman? He <b>is</b> learned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings, yet he <b>is</b> not among us. What <b>is</b> his counsel-if he knows <b>the</b> things that we have heard?”
<br>   “The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,” said Elrond. “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> not overlooked them, <b>and</b> they shall be answered. But these things <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>to</b> make clear; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> call upon him last, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> honour, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> all this matter he has been <b>the</b> chief.”
<br>   “Some, Galdor,” said Gandalf, “would think <b>the</b> tidings <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> Frodo, proof enough that <b>the</b> halfling's trove <b>is</b> a thing <b>of</b> great worth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a ring. What then? The Nine <b>the</b> Nazg?l keep. The Seven are taken <b>or</b> destroyed.” At this Gl?<b>in</b> stirred, <b>but</b> did not speak. “The Three we know <b>of</b>. What then <b>is</b> this one that he desires so much?
<br>   “There <b>is</b> indeed a wide waste <b>of</b> time between <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mountain, between <b>the</b> loss <b>and</b> <b>the</b> finding. But <b>the</b> gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For <b>the</b> Enemy has been close behind, closer even than <b>I</b> feared. And well <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that not until this year, this <b>very</b> summer, as <b>it</b> seems, did he learn <b>the</b> full truth.
<br>   “Some here will remember that many years ago <b>I</b> myself dared <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Necromancer <b>in</b> Dol Guldur, <b>and</b> secretly explored his ways, <b>and</b> found thus that our fears were true: he <b>was</b> none other than Sauron, our Enemy <b>of</b> old, at length taking shape <b>and</b> power again. Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, <b>and</b> for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council put forth its strength <b>and</b> drove <b>the</b> evil out <b>of</b> Mirkwood <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> this Ring: a strange chance, if chance <b>it</b> <b>was</b>.
<br>   “But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also <b>had</b> watched us, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all <b>was</b> ready. Then he gave way before us, <b>but</b> only feigned <b>to</b> flee, <b>and</b> soon after came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower <b>and</b> openly declared himself. Then for <b>the</b> last time <b>the</b> Council met; for now we learned that he <b>was</b> seeking ever more eagerly for <b>the</b> One. We feared then that he <b>had</b> some news <b>of</b> <b>it</b> that we knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b>. But Saruman said nay, <b>and</b> repeated <b>what</b> he <b>had</b> said <b>to</b> us before: that <b>the</b> One would never again be found <b>in</b> Middle-earth.
<br>   “At <b>the</b> worst,” said he, “our Enemy knows that we have <b>it</b> not <b>and</b> that <b>it</b> still <b>is</b> lost. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat him. Have <b>I</b> not earnestly studied this matter? Into Anduin <b>the</b> Great <b>it</b> fell; <b>and</b> long ago, while Sauron slept, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> rolled down <b>the</b> River <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea. There let <b>it</b> lie until <b>the</b> End.”
<br>   Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from <b>the</b> porch <b>to</b> <b>the</b> far peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, at whose great roots <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>had</b> so long lain hidden. He sighed.
<br>   “There <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at fault,” he said. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> lulled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman <b>the</b> Wise; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should have sought for <b>the</b> truth sooner, <b>and</b> our peril would now be less.”
<br>   “We were all at fault,” said Elrond, “<b>and</b> <b>but</b> for your vigilance <b>the</b> Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “From <b>the</b> first my heart misgave me, against all reason that <b>I</b> knew,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> desired <b>to</b> know how this thing came <b>to</b> Gollum, <b>and</b> how long he <b>had</b> possessed <b>it</b>. So <b>I</b> set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness <b>to</b> seek for his treasure. He came, <b>but</b> he escaped <b>and</b> <b>was</b> not found. And then alas! <b>I</b> let <b>the</b> matter rest, watching <b>and</b> waiting only, as we have too often done.
<br>   “Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again <b>to</b> sudden fear. Whence came <b>the</b> hobbit's ring? What, if my fear <b>was</b> true, should be done with <b>it</b>? Those things <b>I</b> must decide. But <b>I</b> spoke yet <b>of</b> my dread <b>to</b> none, knowing <b>the</b> peril <b>of</b> an untimely whisper, if <b>it</b> went astray. In all <b>the</b> long wars with <b>the</b> Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe.
<br>   “That <b>was</b> seventeen years ago. Soon <b>I</b> became aware that spies <b>of</b> many sorts, even beasts <b>and</b> birds, were gathered round <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> my fear grew. <b>I</b> called for <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain, <b>and</b> their watch <b>was</b> doubled; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> opened my heart <b>to</b> Aragorn, <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Isildur.”
<br>   “And <b>I</b>,” said Aragorn, “counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too late though <b>it</b> may seem. And since <b>it</b> seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour <b>to</b> repair Isildur's fault, <b>I</b> went with Gandalf <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long <b>and</b> hopeless search.”
<br>   Then Gandalf told how they <b>had</b> explored <b>the</b> whole length <b>of</b> Wilderland, down even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> Mordor. “There we <b>had</b> rumour <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> we guess that he dwelt there long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark hills; <b>but</b> we never found him, <b>and</b> at last <b>I</b> despaired. And then <b>in</b> my despair <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> again <b>of</b> a test that might make <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> Gollum unneeded. The ring itself might tell if <b>it</b> were <b>the</b> One. The memory <b>of</b> words at <b>the</b> Council came back <b>to</b> me: words <b>of</b> Saruman, half-heeded at <b>the</b> time. <b>I</b> heard them now clearly <b>in</b> my heart.
<br>   “The Nine, <b>the</b> Seven, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Three,” he said, “<b>had</b> each their proper gem. Not so <b>the</b> One. It <b>was</b> round <b>and</b> unadorned, as <b>it</b> were one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser rings; <b>but</b> its maker set marks upon <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> skilled, maybe, could still see <b>and</b> read."
<br>   “What those marks were he <b>had</b> not said. Who now would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, <b>it</b> must have a source. What hand save Sauron's ever held this thing, ere <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lost? The hand <b>of</b> Isildur alone.
<br>   “With that <b>thought</b>, <b>I</b> forsook <b>the</b> chase, <b>and</b> passed swiftly <b>to</b> Gondor. In former days <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> my order <b>had</b> been well received there, <b>but</b> Saruman most <b>of</b> all. Often he <b>had</b> been for long <b>the</b> guest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City. Less welcome did <b>the</b> Lord Denethor show me then than <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> grudgingly he permitted me <b>to</b> search among his hoarded scrolls <b>and</b> books.
<br>   “If indeed you look only, as you say, for records <b>of</b> ancient days, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City, read <b>on</b>!” he said. “For <b>to</b> me <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>is</b> less dark than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> come, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> my care. But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find naught that <b>is</b> not well known <b>to</b> me, who am master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lore <b>of</b> this City."
<br>   “So said Denethor. And yet there lie <b>in</b> his hoards many records that few now can read, even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lore-masters, for their scripts <b>and</b> tongues have become dark <b>to</b> later men. And Boromir, there lies <b>in</b> Minas Tirith still, unread, <b>I</b> guess, <b>by</b> any save Saruman <b>and</b> myself since <b>the</b> kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight from <b>the</b> war <b>in</b> Mordor, as some have told <b>the</b> tale.”
<br>   “Some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, maybe,” Boromir broke <b>in</b>. “All know <b>in</b> Gondor that he went first <b>to</b> Minas Anor <b>and</b> dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed <b>to</b> him <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Kingdom. In that time he planted there <b>the</b> last sapling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Tree <b>in</b> memory <b>of</b> his brother.”
<br>   “But <b>in</b> that time also he made this scroll,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> that <b>is</b> not remembered <b>in</b> Gondor, <b>it</b> would seem. For this scroll concerns <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> thus wrote Isildur therein:
<br>   The Great Ring shall go now <b>to</b> be an heirloom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Kingdom; <b>but</b> records <b>of</b> <b>it</b> shall be left <b>in</b> Gondor, where also dwell <b>the</b> heirs <b>of</b> Elendil, lest a time come when <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> these great matters shall grow dim.
<br>   “And after these words Isildur described <b>the</b> Ring, such as he found <b>it</b>.
<br>   It <b>was</b> hot when <b>I</b> first took <b>it</b>, hot as a glede, <b>and</b> my hand <b>was</b> scorched, so that <b>I</b> doubt if ever again <b>I</b> shall be free <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pain <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Yet even as <b>I</b> write <b>it</b> <b>is</b> cooled, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemeth <b>to</b> shrink, though <b>it</b> loseth neither its beauty nor its shape. Already <b>the</b> writing upon <b>it</b>, which at first <b>was</b> as clear as red flame, fadeth <b>and</b> <b>is</b> now only barely <b>to</b> be read. It <b>is</b> fashioned <b>in</b> an elven-script <b>of</b> Eregion, for they have <b>no</b> letters <b>in</b> Mordor for such subtle work; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> language <b>is</b> unknown <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> deem <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Land, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> foul <b>and</b> uncouth. What evil <b>it</b> saith <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> trace here a copy <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, lest <b>it</b> fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, <b>the</b> heat <b>of</b> Sauron's hand, which <b>was</b> black <b>and</b> yet burned like fire, <b>and</b> so Gil-galad <b>was</b> destroyed; <b>and</b> maybe were <b>the</b> gold made hot again, <b>the</b> writing would be refreshed. But for my part <b>I</b> will risk <b>no</b> hurt <b>to</b> this thing: <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> works <b>of</b> Sauron <b>the</b> only fair. It <b>is</b> precious <b>to</b> me, though <b>I</b> buy <b>it</b> with great pain.
<br>   “When <b>I</b> read these words, my quest <b>was</b> ended. For <b>the</b> traced writing <b>was</b> indeed as Isildur guessed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tongue <b>of</b> Mordor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tower. And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said therein <b>was</b> already known. For <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day that Sauron first put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> One, Celebrimbor, maker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three, <b>was</b> aware <b>of</b> him, <b>and</b> from afar he heard him speak these words, <b>and</b> so his evil purposes were revealed.
<br>   “At <b>once</b> <b>I</b> took my leave <b>of</b> Denethor, <b>but</b> even as <b>I</b> went northwards, messages came <b>to</b> me out <b>of</b> L?rien that Aragorn <b>had</b> passed that way, <b>and</b> that he <b>had</b> found <b>the</b> creature called Gollum. Therefore <b>I</b> went first <b>to</b> meet him <b>and</b> hear his tale. Into <b>what</b> deadly perils he <b>had</b> gone alone <b>I</b> dared not guess.”
<br>   “There <b>is</b> little need <b>to</b> tell <b>of</b> them,” said Aragorn. “If a man must needs walk <b>in</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Gate, <b>or</b> tread <b>the</b> deadly flowers <b>of</b> Morgul Vale, then perils he will have. <b>I</b>, too, despaired at last, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> began my homeward journey. And then, <b>by</b> fortune, <b>I</b> came suddenly <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> sought: <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now <b>the</b> trail <b>was</b> fresh <b>and</b> swift, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> led not <b>to</b> Mordor <b>but</b> away. Along <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dead Marshes <b>I</b> followed <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> him. Lurking <b>by</b> a stagnant mere, peering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water as <b>the</b> dark eve fell, <b>I</b> caught him, Gollum. He <b>was</b> covered with green slime. He will never love me, <b>I</b> fear; for he bit me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not gentle. Nothing more did <b>I</b> ever <b>get</b> from his mouth than <b>the</b> marks <b>of</b> his teeth. <b>I</b> deemed <b>it</b> <b>the</b> worst part <b>of</b> all my journey, <b>the</b> road back, watching him day <b>and</b> night, making him walk before me with a halter <b>on</b> his neck, gagged, until he <b>was</b> tamed <b>by</b> lack <b>of</b> drink <b>and</b> food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. <b>I</b> brought him there at last <b>and</b> gave him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves, for we <b>had</b> agreed that this should be done; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad <b>to</b> be rid <b>of</b> his company, for he stank. For my part <b>I</b> hope never <b>to</b> look upon him again; <b>but</b> Gandalf came <b>and</b> endured long speech with him.”
<br>   “Yes, long <b>and</b> weary,” said Gandalf, “<b>but</b> not <b>without</b> profit. For one thing, <b>the</b> tale he told <b>of</b> his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now told openly for <b>the</b> first time; <b>but</b> that mattered little, since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already guessed <b>it</b>. But <b>I</b> learned then first that Gollum's ring came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River nigh <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gladden Fields. And <b>I</b> learned also that he <b>had</b> possessed <b>it</b> long. Many lives <b>of</b> his small kind. The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>had</b> lengthened his years far beyond their span; <b>but</b> that power only <b>the</b> Great Rings wield.
<br>   “And if that <b>is</b> not proof enough, Galdor, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> other test that <b>I</b> spoke <b>of</b>. Upon this <b>very</b> ring which you have here seen held aloft, round <b>and</b> unadorned, <b>the</b> letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one has <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> will <b>to</b> set <b>the</b> golden thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire a while. That <b>I</b> have done, <b>and</b> this <b>I</b> have read:
<br>   Ash nazg durbatul?k, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatul?k agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.”
<br>   The change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wizard's voice <b>was</b> astounding. Suddenly <b>it</b> became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass over <b>the</b> high sun, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves stopped their ears.
<br>   “Never before has any voice dared <b>to</b> utter <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> that tongue <b>in</b> Imladris, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey,” said Elrond, as <b>the</b> shadow passed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> company breathed <b>once</b> more.
<br>   “And let us hope that none will ever speak <b>it</b> here again,” answered Gandalf. “Nonetheless <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that tongue <b>is</b> not soon <b>to</b> be heard <b>in</b> every corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West, then let all put doubt aside that this thing <b>is</b> indeed <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Wise have declared: <b>the</b> treasure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, fraught with all his malice; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> lies a great part <b>of</b> his strength <b>of</b> old. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Years come <b>the</b> words that <b>the</b> Smiths <b>of</b> Eregion heard, <b>and</b> knew that they <b>had</b> been betrayed:
<br>   One Ring <b>to</b> rule them all, One Ring <b>to</b> find them, One Ring <b>to</b> bring them all <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Darkness bind them.
<br>   “Know also, my friends, that <b>I</b> learned more yet from Gollum. He <b>was</b> loth <b>to</b> speak <b>and</b> his tale <b>was</b> unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> beyond all doubt that he went <b>to</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> there all that he knew <b>was</b> forced from him. Thus <b>the</b> Enemy knows now that <b>the</b> One <b>is</b> found, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>and</b> since his servants have pursued <b>it</b> almost <b>to</b> our door, he soon will know, already he may know, even as <b>I</b> speak, that we have <b>it</b> here.”
<br>   All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. “He <b>is</b> a small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, <b>but</b> great <b>in</b> mischief. What became <b>of</b> him? To <b>what</b> doom did you put him?”
<br>   “He <b>is</b> <b>in</b> prison, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> worse,” said Aragorn. “He <b>had</b> suffered much. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> doubt that he <b>was</b> tormented, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> Sauron lies black <b>on</b> his heart. Still <b>I</b> for one am glad that he <b>is</b> safely kept <b>by</b> <b>the</b> watchful Elves <b>of</b> Mirkwood. His malice <b>is</b> great <b>and</b> gives him a strength hardly <b>to</b> be believed <b>in</b> one so lean <b>and</b> withered. He could work much mischief still, if he were free. And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that he <b>was</b> allowed <b>to</b> leave Mordor <b>on</b> some evil errand.”
<br>   “Alas! alas!” cried Legolas, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> his fair elvish face there <b>was</b> great distress. “The tidings that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent <b>to</b> bring must now be told. They are not good, <b>but</b> only here have <b>I</b> learned how evil they may seem <b>to</b> this company. Sm?agol, who <b>is</b> now called Gollum, has escaped.”
<br>   “Escaped?” cried Aragorn. “That <b>is</b> ill news indeed. We shall all rue <b>it</b> bitterly, <b>I</b> fear. How came <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Thranduil <b>to</b> fail <b>in</b> their trust?”
<br>   “Not through lack <b>of</b> watchfulness,” said Legolas; “<b>but</b> perhaps through over-kindliness. And we fear that <b>the</b> prisoner <b>had</b> aid from others, <b>and</b> that more <b>is</b> known <b>of</b> our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day <b>and</b> night, at Gandalf's bidding, much though we wearied <b>of</b> <b>the</b> task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, <b>and</b> we <b>had</b> not <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> keep him ever <b>in</b> dungeons under <b>the</b> earth, where he would fall back <b>into</b> his old black thoughts.”
<br>   “You were less tender <b>to</b> me,” said Gl?<b>in</b> with a flash <b>of</b> his eyes as old memories were stirred <b>of</b> his imprisonment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-king's halls.
<br>   “Now come!” said Gandalf. “Pray <b>do</b> not interrupt, my good Gl?<b>in</b>. That <b>was</b> a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right. If all <b>the</b> grievances that stand between Elves <b>and</b> Dwarves are <b>to</b> be brought up here, we may as well abandon this Council.”
<br>   Gl?<b>in</b> rose <b>and</b> bowed, <b>and</b> Legolas continued. “In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> fair weather we led Gollum through <b>the</b> woods; <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a high tree standing alone far from <b>the</b> others which he liked <b>to</b> climb. Often we let him mount up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highest branches, until he felt <b>the</b> free wind; <b>but</b> we set a guard at <b>the</b> tree's foot. One day he refused <b>to</b> come down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> guards <b>had</b> <b>no</b> mind <b>to</b> climb after him: he <b>had</b> learned <b>the</b> trick <b>of</b> clinging <b>to</b> boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so they sat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tree far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> that <b>very</b> night <b>of</b> summer, yet moonless <b>and</b> starless, that Orcs came <b>on</b> us at unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many <b>and</b> fierce, <b>but</b> they came from over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> were unused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods. When <b>the</b> battle <b>was</b> over, we found that Gollum <b>was</b> gone, <b>and</b> his guards were slain <b>or</b> taken. It then seemed plain <b>to</b> us that <b>the</b> attack <b>had</b> been made for his rescue, <b>and</b> that he knew <b>of</b> <b>it</b> beforehand. How that <b>was</b> contrived we cannot guess; <b>but</b> Gollum <b>is</b> cunning, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> spies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy are many. The dark things that were driven out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dragon's fall have returned <b>in</b> greater numbers, <b>and</b> Mirkwood <b>is</b> again an evil place, save where our realm <b>is</b> maintained.
<br>   “We have failed <b>to</b> recapture Gollum. We came <b>on</b> his trail among those <b>of</b> many Orcs, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> plunged deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Forest, going south. But ere long <b>it</b> escaped our skill, <b>and</b> we dared not continue <b>the</b> hunt; for we were drawing nigh <b>to</b> Dol Guldur, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> still a <b>very</b> evil place; we <b>do</b> not go that way.”
<br>   “Well, well, he <b>is</b> gone,” said Gandalf. “We have <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> seek for him again. He must <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he will. But he may play a part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.
<br>   “And now <b>I</b> will answer Galdor's other questions. What <b>of</b> Saruman? What are his counsels <b>to</b> us <b>in</b> this need? This tale <b>I</b> must tell <b>in</b> full, for only Elrond has heard <b>it</b> yet, <b>and</b> that <b>in</b> brief, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will bear <b>on</b> all that we must resolve. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last chapter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, so far as <b>it</b> has yet gone.
<br>   “At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> June <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>but</b> a cloud <b>of</b> anxiety <b>was</b> <b>on</b> my mind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little land; for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a foreboding <b>of</b> some danger, still hidden from me <b>but</b> drawing near. There messages reached me telling me <b>of</b> war <b>and</b> defeat <b>in</b> Gondor, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> heard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But <b>I</b> found <b>nothing</b> save a few fugitives from <b>the</b> South; yet <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me that <b>on</b> them sat a fear <b>of</b> which they would not speak. <b>I</b> turned then east <b>and</b> north <b>and</b> journeyed along <b>the</b> Greenway; <b>and</b> not far from Bree <b>I</b> came upon a traveller <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a <b>bank</b> beside <b>the</b> road with his grazing horse beside him. It <b>was</b> Radagast <b>the</b> Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Mirkwood. He <b>is</b> one <b>of</b> my order, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not seen him for many a year.
<br>   “Gandalf!” he cried. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> seeking you. But <b>I</b> am a stranger <b>in</b> these parts. All <b>I</b> knew <b>was</b> that you might be found <b>in</b> a wild region with <b>the</b> uncouth name <b>of</b> Shire."
<br>   “Your information <b>was</b> correct,” <b>I</b> said. “But <b>do</b> not put <b>it</b> that way, if you meet any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants. You are near <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire now. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a traveller, unless driven <b>by</b> great need."
<br>   “<b>I</b> have an urgent errand,” he said. “My news <b>is</b> evil.” Then he looked about him, as if <b>the</b> hedges might have ears. “Nazg?l,” he whispered. “The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed <b>the</b> River secretly <b>and</b> are moving westward. They have taken <b>the</b> guise <b>of</b> riders <b>in</b> black."
<br>   “<b>I</b> knew then <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dreaded <b>without</b> knowing <b>it</b>.
<br>   “The enemy must have some great need <b>or</b> purpose,” said Radagast; “<b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that makes him look <b>to</b> these distant <b>and</b> desolate parts, <b>I</b> cannot guess."
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you mean?” said <b>I</b>.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have been told that wherever they go <b>the</b> Riders ask for news <b>of</b> a land called Shire."
<br>   “The Shire,” <b>I</b> said; <b>but</b> my heart sank. For even <b>the</b> Wise might fear <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> Nine, when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain. A great king <b>and</b> sorcerer he <b>was</b> <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> now he wields a deadly fear. “Who told you, <b>and</b> who sent you?” <b>I</b> asked.
<br>   “Saruman <b>the</b> White,” answered Radagast. “And he told me <b>to</b> say that if you feel <b>the</b> need, he will help; <b>but</b> you must seek his aid at <b>once</b>, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> will be too late."
<br>   “And that message brought me hope. For Saruman <b>the</b> White <b>is</b> <b>the</b> greatest <b>of</b> my order. Radagast <b>is</b>, <b>of</b> course, a worthy Wizard, a master <b>of</b> shapes <b>and</b> changes <b>of</b> hue; <b>and</b> he has much lore <b>of</b> herbs <b>and</b> beasts, <b>and</b> birds are especially his friends. But Saruman has long studied <b>the</b> arts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy himself, <b>and</b> thus we have often been able <b>to</b> forestall him. It <b>was</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> devices <b>of</b> Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he <b>had</b> found some weapons that would drive back <b>the</b> Nine.
<br>   “<b>I</b> will go <b>to</b> Saruman,” <b>I</b> said.
<br>   “Then you must go now,” said Radagast; “for <b>I</b> have wasted time <b>in</b> looking for you, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> days are running short. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told <b>to</b> find you before Midsummer, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before <b>the</b> Nine discover <b>the</b> land that they seek. <b>I</b> myself shall turn back at <b>once</b>.” And with that he mounted <b>and</b> would have ridden straight off.
<br>   “Stay a moment!” <b>I</b> said. “We shall need your help, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> all things that will give <b>it</b>. Send out messages <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> beasts <b>and</b> birds that are your friends. Tell them <b>to</b> bring news <b>of</b> anything that bears <b>on</b> this matter <b>to</b> Saruman <b>and</b> Gandalf. Let messages be sent <b>to</b> Orthanc."
<br>   “<b>I</b> will <b>do</b> that,” he said, <b>and</b> rode off as if <b>the</b> Nine were after him.
<br>   “<b>I</b> could not follow him then <b>and</b> there. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ridden <b>very</b> far already that day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as weary as my horse; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> needed <b>to</b> consider matters. <b>I</b> stayed <b>the</b> night <b>in</b> Bree, <b>and</b> decided that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Never did <b>I</b> make a greater mistake!
<br>   “However, <b>I</b> wrote a message <b>to</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> trusted <b>to</b> my friend <b>the</b> innkeeper <b>to</b> send <b>it</b> <b>to</b> him. <b>I</b> rode away at dawn; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> came at long last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dwelling <b>of</b> Saruman. That <b>is</b> far south <b>in</b> Isengard, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains, not far from <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan. And Boromir will tell you that that <b>is</b> a great open vale that lies between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> northmost foothills <b>of</b> Ered Nimrais, <b>the</b> White Mountains <b>of</b> his home. But Isengard <b>is</b> a circle <b>of</b> sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> that valley <b>is</b> a tower <b>of</b> stone called Orthanc. It <b>was</b> not made <b>by</b> Saruman, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> N?menor long ago; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> tall <b>and</b> has many secrets; yet <b>it</b> looks not <b>to</b> be a work <b>of</b> craft. It cannot be reached save <b>by</b> passing <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Isengard; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> that circle there <b>is</b> only one gate.
<br>   “Late one evening <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate, like a great arch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>of</b> rock; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> strongly guarded. But <b>the</b> keepers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> watch for me <b>and</b> told me that Saruman awaited me. <b>I</b> rode under <b>the</b> arch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gate closed silently behind me, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid, though <b>I</b> knew <b>no</b> reason for <b>it</b>.
<br>   “But <b>I</b> rode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> Orthanc, <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stair <b>of</b> Saruman <b>and</b> there he met me <b>and</b> led me up <b>to</b> his high chamber. He wore a ring <b>on</b> his finger.
<br>   “So you have come, Gandalf,” he said <b>to</b> me gravely; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> his eyes there seemed <b>to</b> be a white light, as if a cold laughter <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his heart.
<br>   “Yes, <b>I</b> have come,” <b>I</b> said. “<b>I</b> have come for your aid, Saruman <b>the</b> White.” And that title seemed <b>to</b> anger him.
<br>   “Have you indeed, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey!” he scoffed. “For aid? It has seldom been heard <b>of</b> that Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey sought for aid, one so cunning <b>and</b> so wise, wandering about <b>the</b> lands, <b>and</b> concerning himself <b>in</b> every business, whether <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> him <b>or</b> not."
<br>   “<b>I</b> looked at him <b>and</b> wondered. “But if <b>I</b> am not deceived,” said <b>I</b>, “things are now moving which will require <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> all our strength."
<br>   “That may be so,” he said, “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>is</b> late <b>in</b> coming <b>to</b> you. How long. <b>I</b> wonder, have you concealed from me, <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council, a matter <b>of</b> greatest import? What brings you now from your lurking-place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire? “
<br>   “The Nine have come forth again,” <b>I</b> answered. “They have crossed <b>the</b> River. So Radagast said <b>to</b> me."
<br>   “Radagast <b>the</b> Brown!” laughed Saruman, <b>and</b> he <b>no</b> longer concealed his scorn. “Radagast <b>the</b> Bird-tamer! Radagast <b>the</b> Simple! Radagast <b>the</b> Fool! Yet he <b>had</b> just <b>the</b> wit <b>to</b> play <b>the</b> part that <b>I</b> set him. For you have come, <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> all <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> rest from journeys. For <b>I</b> am Saruman <b>the</b> Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman <b>of</b> Many Colours! “
<br>   “<b>I</b> looked then <b>and</b> saw that his robes, which <b>had</b> seemed white, were not so, <b>but</b> were woven <b>of</b> all colours. <b>and</b> if he moved they shimmered <b>and</b> changed hue so that <b>the</b> eye <b>was</b> bewildered.
<br>   “<b>I</b> liked white better,” <b>I</b> said.
<br>   “White!” he sneered. “It serves as a <b>beginning</b>. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> white light can be broken."
<br>   “In which case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer white,” said <b>I</b>. “And he that breaks a thing <b>to</b> find out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> has left <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> wisdom."
<br>   “You need not speak <b>to</b> me as <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fools that you take for friends,” said he. “<b>I</b> have not brought you hither <b>to</b> be instructed <b>by</b> you, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> give you a choice."
<br>   “He drew himself up then <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> declaim, as if he were making a speech long rehearsed. “The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are <b>beginning</b>. The time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>is</b> over, <b>but</b> our time <b>is</b> at hand: <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> Men, which we must rule. But we must have power, power <b>to</b> order all things as we will, for that good which only <b>the</b> Wise can see.
<br>   “And listen, Gandalf, my old friend <b>and</b> helper!” he said, coming near <b>and</b> speaking now <b>in</b> a softer voice. “<b>I</b> said we, for we <b>it</b> may be, if you will join with me. A new Power <b>is</b> rising. Against <b>it</b> <b>the</b> old allies <b>and</b> policies will not avail us at all. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> hope left <b>in</b> Elves <b>or</b> dying N?menor. This then <b>is</b> one choice before you. before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There <b>is</b> hope that way. Its victory <b>is</b> at hand; <b>and</b> there will be rich reward for those that aided <b>it</b>. As <b>the</b> Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wise, such as you <b>and</b> <b>I</b>, may with patience come at last <b>to</b> direct its courses, <b>to</b> control <b>it</b>. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts <b>in</b> our hearts, deploring maybe evils done <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way, <b>but</b> approving <b>the</b> high <b>and</b> ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all <b>the</b> things that we have so far striven <b>in</b> vain <b>to</b> accomplish, hindered rather than helped <b>by</b> our weak <b>or</b> idle friends. There need not be, there would not be, any real change <b>in</b> our designs, only <b>in</b> our means."
<br>   “Saruman,” <b>I</b> said, “<b>I</b> have heard speeches <b>of</b> this kind before, <b>but</b> only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> emissaries sent from Mordor <b>to</b> deceive <b>the</b> ignorant. <b>I</b> cannot think that you brought me so far only <b>to</b> weary my ears."
<br>   “He looked at me sidelong, <b>and</b> paused a while considering. “Well, <b>I</b> see that this wise course does not commend itself <b>to</b> you,” he said. “Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived? “
<br>   “He came <b>and</b> laid his long hand <b>on</b> my arm. “And why not, Gandalf?” he whispered. “Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command that, then <b>the</b> Power would pass <b>to</b> us. That <b>is</b> <b>in</b> truth why <b>I</b> brought you here. For <b>I</b> have many eyes <b>in</b> my service, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believe that you know where this precious thing now lies. Is <b>it</b> not so? Or why <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Nine ask for <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> your business there?” As he said this a lust which he could not conceal shone suddenly <b>in</b> his eyes.
<br>   “Saruman,” <b>I</b> said, standing away from him, “only one hand at a time can wield <b>the</b> One, <b>and</b> you know that well, so <b>do</b> not trouble <b>to</b> say we! But <b>I</b> would not give <b>it</b>, nay, <b>I</b> would not give even news <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> you, now that <b>I</b> learn your mind. You were head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>but</b> you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, <b>the</b> choices are, <b>it</b> seems, <b>to</b> submit <b>to</b> Sauron, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> yourself. <b>I</b> will take neither. Have you others <b>to</b> offer? “
<br>   “He <b>was</b> cold now <b>and</b> perilous. “Yes,” he said. “<b>I</b> did not expect you <b>to</b> show wisdom, even <b>in</b> your own behalf; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> gave you <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> aiding me willingly. <b>and</b> so saving yourself much trouble <b>and</b> pain. The third choice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> stay here, until <b>the</b> end."
<br>   “Until <b>what</b> end? “
<br>   “Until you reveal <b>to</b> me where <b>the</b> One may be found. <b>I</b> may find means <b>to</b> persuade you. Or until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> found <b>in</b> your despite, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ruler has time <b>to</b> turn <b>to</b> lighter matters: <b>to</b> devise, say, a fitting reward for <b>the</b> hindrance <b>and</b> insolence <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey."
<br>   “That may not prove <b>to</b> be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighter matters,” said <b>I</b>. He laughed at me, for my words were empty, <b>and</b> he knew <b>it</b>.
<br>   “They took me <b>and</b> they set me alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle <b>of</b> Orthanc, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place where Saruman <b>was</b> accustomed <b>to</b> watch <b>the</b> stars. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> descent save <b>by</b> a narrow stair <b>of</b> many thousand steps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> valley below seems far away. <b>I</b> looked <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> saw that, whereas <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been green <b>and</b> fair, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> now filled with pits <b>and</b> forges. Wolves <b>and</b> orcs were housed <b>in</b> Isengard, for Saruman <b>was</b> mustering a great force <b>on</b> his own account, <b>in</b> rivalry <b>of</b> Sauron <b>and</b> not <b>in</b> his service yet. Over all his works a dark smoke hung <b>and</b> wrapped itself about <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> Orthanc. <b>I</b> stood alone <b>on</b> an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clouds; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> escape, <b>and</b> my days were bitter. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> pierced with cold, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>but</b> little room <b>in</b> which <b>to</b> pace <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro, brooding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North.
<br>   “That <b>the</b> Nine <b>had</b> indeed arisen <b>I</b> felt assured, apart from <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Saruman which might be lies. Long ere <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> Isengard <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard tidings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way that could not be mistaken. Fear <b>was</b> ever <b>in</b> my heart for my friends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire; <b>but</b> still <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some hope. <b>I</b> hoped that Frodo <b>had</b> set forth at <b>once</b>, as my letter <b>had</b> urged, <b>and</b> that he <b>had</b> reached Rivendell before <b>the</b> deadly pursuit began. And both my fear <b>and</b> my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope <b>was</b> founded <b>on</b> a fat man <b>in</b> Bree; <b>and</b> my fear <b>was</b> founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cunning <b>of</b> Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls <b>to</b> answer; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Sauron <b>is</b> still less than fear makes <b>it</b>. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> Isengard, trapped <b>and</b> alone, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not easy <b>to</b> think that <b>the</b> hunters before whom all have fled <b>or</b> fallen would falter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire far away.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> saw you!” cried Frodo. “You were walking backwards <b>and</b> forwards. The moon shone <b>in</b> your hair.”
<br>   Gandalf paused astonished <b>and</b> looked at him. “It <b>was</b> only a dream” said Frodo, “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> suddenly came back <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> quite forgotten <b>it</b>. It came some time ago; after <b>I</b> left <b>the</b> Shire, <b>I</b> think.”
<br>   “Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> late <b>in</b> coming,” said Gandalf, “as you will see. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that <b>I</b> have seldom been <b>in</b> such need, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey caught like a fly <b>in</b> a spider's treacherous web! Yet even <b>the</b> most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.
<br>   “At first <b>I</b> feared, as Saruman <b>no</b> doubt intended, that Radagast <b>had</b> also fallen. Yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> caught <b>no</b> hint <b>of</b> anything wrong <b>in</b> his voice <b>or</b> <b>in</b> his eye at our meeting. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b>, <b>I</b> should never have gone <b>to</b> Isengard, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> concealed his mind <b>and</b> deceived his messenger. It would have been useless <b>in</b> any case <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> win over <b>the</b> honest Radagast <b>to</b> treachery. He sought me <b>in</b> good faith, <b>and</b> so persuaded me.
<br>   “That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> undoing <b>of</b> Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew <b>no</b> reason why he should not <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> asked; <b>and</b> he rode away towards Mirkwood where he <b>had</b> many friends <b>of</b> old. And <b>the</b> Eagles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains went far <b>and</b> wide, <b>and</b> they saw many things: <b>the</b> gathering <b>of</b> wolves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mustering <b>of</b> Orcs; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine Riders going hither <b>and</b> thither <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lands; <b>and</b> they heard news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escape <b>of</b> Gollum. And they sent a messenger <b>to</b> bring these tidings <b>to</b> me.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that when summer waned, there came a night <b>of</b> moon, <b>and</b> Gwaihir <b>the</b> Windlord, swiftest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Eagles, came unlooked-for <b>to</b> Orthanc; <b>and</b> he found me standing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pinnacle. Then <b>I</b> spoke <b>to</b> him <b>and</b> he bore me away, before Saruman <b>was</b> aware. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> far from Isengard, ere <b>the</b> wolves <b>and</b> orcs issued from <b>the</b> gate <b>to</b> pursue me.
<br>   “How far can you bear me?” <b>I</b> said <b>to</b> Gwaihir.
<br>   “Many leagues,” said he, “<b>but</b> not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent <b>to</b> bear tidings not burdens."
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> must have a steed <b>on</b> land,” <b>I</b> said, “<b>and</b> a steed surpassingly swift, for <b>I</b> have never <b>had</b> such need <b>of</b> haste before."
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> will bear you <b>to</b> Edoras, where <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Rohan sits <b>in</b> his halls,” he said; “for that <b>is</b> not <b>very</b> far off.” And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> glad, for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Riddermark <b>of</b> Rohan <b>the</b> Rohirrim, <b>the</b> Horse-lords, dwell, <b>and</b> there are <b>no</b> horses like those that are bred <b>in</b> that great vale between <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White.
<br>   “Are <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Rohan still <b>to</b> be trusted, <b>do</b> you think?” <b>I</b> said <b>to</b> Gwaihir, for <b>the</b> treason <b>of</b> Saruman <b>had</b> shaken my faith.
<br>   “They pay a tribute <b>of</b> horses,” he answered, “<b>and</b> send many yearly <b>to</b> Mordor, <b>or</b> so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said; <b>but</b> they are not yet under <b>the</b> yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed."
<br>   “He set me down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Rohan ere dawn; <b>and</b> now <b>I</b> have lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In Rohan <b>I</b> found evil already at work: <b>the</b> lies <b>of</b> Saruman; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> king <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land would not listen <b>to</b> my warnings. He bade me take a horse <b>and</b> be gone; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> chose one much <b>to</b> my liking. <b>but</b> little <b>to</b> his. <b>I</b> took <b>the</b> best horse <b>in</b> his land, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have never seen <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> him.”
<br>   “Then he must be a noble beast indeed,” said Aragorn; “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse <b>to</b> learn that Sauron levies such tribute. It <b>was</b> not so when last <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> that land.”
<br>   “Nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now, <b>I</b> will swear,” said Boromir. “It <b>is</b> a lie that comes from <b>the</b> Enemy. <b>I</b> know <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Rohan; true <b>and</b> valiant, our allies, dwelling still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lands that we gave them long ago.”
<br>   “The shadow <b>of</b> Mordor lies <b>on</b> distant lands,” answered Aragorn. “Saruman has fallen under <b>it</b>. Rohan <b>is</b> beset. Who knows <b>what</b> you will find there, if ever you return?”
<br>   “Not this at least.” said Boromir, “that they will buy their lives with horses. They love their horses next <b>to</b> their kin. And not <b>without</b> reason, for <b>the</b> horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddermark come from <b>the</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, far from <b>the</b> Shadow. <b>and</b> their race, as that <b>of</b> their masters, <b>is</b> descended from <b>the</b> free days <b>of</b> old.”
<br>   “True indeed!” said Gandalf. “And there <b>is</b> one among them that might have been foaled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. The horses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as <b>the</b> flowing wind. Shadowfax they called him. By day his coat glistens like silver; <b>and</b> <b>by</b> night <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like a shade, <b>and</b> he passes unseen. Light <b>is</b> his footfall! Never before <b>had</b> any man mounted him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> took him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> tamed him, <b>and</b> so speedily he bore me that <b>I</b> reached <b>the</b> Shire when Frodo <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Barrow-downs, though <b>I</b> set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.
<br>   “But fear grew <b>in</b> me as <b>I</b> rode. Ever as <b>I</b> came north <b>I</b> heard tidings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders, <b>and</b> though <b>I</b> gained <b>on</b> them day <b>by</b> day, they were ever before me. They <b>had</b> divided their forces, <b>I</b> learned: some remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern borders, not far from <b>the</b> Greenway. <b>and</b> some invaded <b>the</b> Shire from <b>the</b> south. <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> Hobbiton <b>and</b> Frodo <b>had</b> gone; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> words with old Gamgee. Many words <b>and</b> few <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point. He <b>had</b> much <b>to</b> say about <b>the</b> shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new owners <b>of</b> Bag End.
<br>   “<b>I</b> can't abide changes,” said he, “not at my time <b>of</b> life, <b>and</b> least <b>of</b> all changes for <b>the</b> worst.” “Changes for <b>the</b> worst,” he repeated many times.
<br>   “Worst <b>is</b> a bad word,” <b>I</b> said <b>to</b> him, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope you <b>do</b> not live <b>to</b> see <b>it</b>.” But amidst his talk <b>I</b> gathered at last that Frodo <b>had</b> left Hobbiton less than a week before, <b>and</b> that a black horseman <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hill <b>the</b> same evening. Then <b>I</b> rode <b>on</b> <b>in</b> fear. <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> Buckland <b>and</b> found <b>it</b> <b>in</b> uproar, as busy as a hive <b>of</b> ants that has been stirred with a stick. <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house at Crickhollow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> broken open <b>and</b> empty; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> threshold there lay a cloak that <b>had</b> been Frodo's. Then for a while hope left me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did not wait <b>to</b> gather news, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> might have been comforted; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> rode <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders. It <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> follow, for <b>it</b> went many ways, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at a loss. But <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me that one <b>or</b> two <b>had</b> ridden towards Bree; <b>and</b> that way <b>I</b> went, for <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> words that might be said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> innkeeper.
<br>   “Butterbur they call him,” <b>thought</b> <b>I</b>. “If this delay <b>was</b> his fault, <b>I</b> will melt all <b>the</b> butter <b>in</b> him. <b>I</b> will roast <b>the</b> old fool over a slow fire.” He expected <b>no</b> less, <b>and</b> when he saw my face he fell down flat <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> melt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.”
<br>   “What did you <b>do</b> <b>to</b> him?” cried Frodo <b>in</b> alarm. “He <b>was</b> really <b>very</b> kind <b>to</b> us <b>and</b> did all that he could.”
<br>   Gandalf laughed. “Don't be afraid!” he said. “<b>I</b> did not bite, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> barked <b>very</b> little. So overjoyed <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that <b>I</b> got out <b>of</b> him, when he stopped quaking, that <b>I</b> embraced <b>the</b> old fellow. How <b>it</b> happened <b>I</b> could not then guess, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> learned that you <b>had</b> been <b>in</b> Bree <b>the</b> night before, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> gone off that morning with Strider.
<br>   “Strider!” <b>I</b> cried, shouting for joy.
<br>   “Yes, sir, <b>I</b> am afraid so, sir,” said Butterbur, mistaking me. “He got at them, <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> all that <b>I</b> could <b>do</b>, <b>and</b> they took up with him. They behaved <b>very</b> queer all <b>the</b> time they were here: wilful, you might say."
<br>   “Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy <b>and</b> beloved Barliman!” said <b>I</b>. “It's <b>the</b> best news <b>I</b> have <b>had</b> since midsummer: <b>it</b>'s worth a gold piece at <b>the</b> least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment <b>of</b> surpassing excellence for seven years!” said <b>I</b>. “Now <b>I</b> can take a night's rest, <b>the</b> first since <b>I</b> have forgotten when."
<br>   “So <b>I</b> stayed there that night, wondering much <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders; for only <b>of</b> two <b>had</b> there yet been any news <b>in</b> Bree, <b>it</b> seemed. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night we heard more. Five at least came from <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> they threw down <b>the</b> gates <b>and</b> passed through Bree like a howling wind; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bree-folk are still shivering <b>and</b> expecting <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>I</b> got up before dawn <b>and</b> went after them.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems clear <b>to</b> me that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened. Their Captain remained <b>in</b> secret away south <b>of</b> Bree, while two rode ahead through <b>the</b> village, <b>and</b> four more invaded <b>the</b> Shire. But when these were foiled <b>in</b> Bree <b>and</b> at Crickhollow, they returned <b>to</b> their Captain with tidings, <b>and</b> so left <b>the</b> Road unguarded for a while, except <b>by</b> their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, <b>and</b> he himself with <b>the</b> rest rode along <b>the</b> Road <b>in</b> great wrath.
<br>   “<b>I</b> galloped <b>to</b> Weathertop like a gale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> reached <b>it</b> before sundown <b>on</b> my second day from Bree-<b>and</b> they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> my anger <b>and</b> they dared not face <b>it</b> while <b>the</b> Sun <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. But they closed round at night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> besieged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old ring <b>of</b> Amon S?l. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hard put <b>to</b> <b>it</b> indeed: such light <b>and</b> flame cannot have been seen <b>on</b> Weathertop since <b>the</b> war-beacons <b>of</b> old.
<br>   “At sunrise <b>I</b> escaped <b>and</b> fled towards <b>the</b> north. <b>I</b> could not hope <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more. It <b>was</b> impossible <b>to</b> find you, Frodo, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> would have been folly <b>to</b> try with all <b>the</b> Nine at my heels. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> trust <b>to</b> Aragorn. But <b>I</b> hoped <b>to</b> draw some <b>of</b> them off, <b>and</b> yet reach Rivendell ahead <b>of</b> you <b>and</b> send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, <b>but</b> they turned back after a while <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> Ford, <b>it</b> seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp <b>was</b> attacked.
<br>   “<b>I</b> reached here at last <b>by</b> a long hard road, up <b>the</b> Hoarwell <b>and</b> through <b>the</b> Ettenmoors, <b>and</b> down from <b>the</b> north. It took me nearly fourteen days from Weathertop, for <b>I</b> could not ride among <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troll-fells, <b>and</b> Shadowfax departed. <b>I</b> sent him back <b>to</b> his master; <b>but</b> a great friendship has grown between us, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> have need he will come at my call. But so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> Rivendell only three days before <b>the</b> Ring, <b>and</b> news <b>of</b> its peril <b>had</b> already been brought here-which proved well indeed.
<br>   “And that, Frodo, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> my account. May Elrond <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others forgive <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. But such a thing has not happened before, that Gandalf broke tryst <b>and</b> did not come when he promised. An account <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ring-bearer <b>of</b> so strange an event <b>was</b> required, <b>I</b> think.
<br>   “Well, <b>the</b> Tale <b>is</b> now told, from first <b>to</b> last. Here we all are, <b>and</b> here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer <b>to</b> our purpose. What shall we <b>do</b> with <b>it</b>?”
<br>   There <b>was</b> silence. At last Elrond spoke again.
<br>   “This <b>is</b> grievous news concerning Saruman,” he said; “for we trusted him <b>and</b> he <b>is</b> deep <b>in</b> all our counsels. It <b>is</b> perilous <b>to</b> study too deeply <b>the</b> arts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy, for good <b>or</b> for ill. But such falls <b>and</b> betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of <b>the</b> tales that we have heard this day <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Frodo <b>was</b> most strange <b>to</b> me. <b>I</b> have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me that he <b>is</b> perhaps not so alone <b>and</b> singular as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> him. The world has changed much since <b>I</b> last <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> westward roads.
<br>   “The Barrow-wights we know <b>by</b> many names; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Forest many tales have been told: all that now remains <b>is</b> <b>but</b> an outlier <b>of</b> its northern march. Time <b>was</b> when a squirrel could go from tree <b>to</b> tree from <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> Dunland west <b>of</b> Isengard. In those lands <b>I</b> journeyed <b>once</b>, <b>and</b> many things wild <b>and</b> strange <b>I</b> knew. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> forgotten Bombadil, if indeed this <b>is</b> still <b>the</b> same that walked <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> hills long ago, <b>and</b> even then <b>was</b> older than <b>the</b> old. That <b>was</b> not then his name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest <b>and</b> fatherless. But many another name he has since been given <b>by</b> other folk: Forn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves, Orald <b>by</b> Northern Men, <b>and</b> other names beside. He <b>is</b> a strange creature, <b>but</b> maybe <b>I</b> should have summoned him <b>to</b> our Council.”
<br>   “He would not have come,” said Gandalf.
<br>   “Could we not still send messages <b>to</b> him <b>and</b> obtain his help?” asked Erestor. “It seems that he has a power even over <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> should not put <b>it</b> so,” said Gandalf. “Say rather that <b>the</b> Ring has <b>no</b> power over him. He <b>is</b> his own master. But he cannot alter <b>the</b> Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he <b>is</b> withdrawn <b>into</b> a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change <b>of</b> days, <b>and</b> he will not step beyond them.”
<br>   “But within those bounds <b>nothing</b> seems <b>to</b> dismay him,” said Erestor. “Would he not take <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> keep <b>it</b> there, for ever harmless?”
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf, “not willingly. He might <b>do</b> so, if all <b>the</b> free folk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world begged him, <b>but</b> he would not understand <b>the</b> need. And if he were given <b>the</b> Ring, he would soon forget <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> most likely throw <b>it</b> away. Such things have <b>no</b> hold <b>on</b> his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; <b>and</b> that alone <b>is</b> answer enough.”
<br>   “But <b>in</b> any case,” said Glorfindel, “<b>to</b> send <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> him would only postpone <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> evil. He <b>is</b> far away. We could not now take <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> him, unguessed, unmarked <b>by</b> any spy. And even if we could, soon <b>or</b> late <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rings would learn <b>of</b> its hiding place <b>and</b> would bend all his power towards <b>it</b>. Could that power be defied <b>by</b> Bombadil alone? <b>I</b> think not. <b>I</b> think that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, if all else <b>is</b> conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he <b>was</b> First; <b>and</b> then Night will come.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know little <b>of</b> Iarwain save <b>the</b> name,” said Galdor; “<b>but</b> Glorfindel, <b>I</b> think, <b>is</b> right. Power <b>to</b> defy our Enemy <b>is</b> not <b>in</b> him, unless such power <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture <b>and</b> destroy <b>the</b> <b>very</b> hills. What power still remains lies with us, here <b>in</b> Imladris, <b>or</b> with Cirdan at <b>the</b> Havens, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> L?rien. But have they <b>the</b> strength, have we here <b>the</b> strength <b>to</b> withstand <b>the</b> Enemy, <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> Sauron at <b>the</b> last, when all else <b>is</b> overthrown?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have not <b>the</b> strength,” said Elrond; “neither have they.”
<br>   “Then if <b>the</b> Ring cannot be kept from him for ever <b>by</b> strength” said Glorfindel, “two things only remain for us <b>to</b> attempt: <b>to</b> send <b>it</b> over <b>the</b> Sea, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “But Gandalf has revealed <b>to</b> us that we cannot destroy <b>it</b> <b>by</b> any craft that we here possess,” said Elrond. “And they who dwell beyond <b>the</b> Sea would not receive <b>it</b>: for good <b>or</b> ill <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> Middle-earth; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for us who still dwell here <b>to</b> deal with <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Then, said Glorfindel, “let us cast <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deeps, <b>and</b> so make <b>the</b> lies <b>of</b> Saruman come true. For <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear now that even at <b>the</b> Council his feet were already <b>on</b> a crooked path. He knew that <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> not lost for ever, <b>but</b> wished us <b>to</b> think so; for he began <b>to</b> lust for <b>it</b> for himself. Yet oft <b>in</b> lies truth <b>is</b> hidden: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sea <b>it</b> would be safe.”
<br>   “Not safe for ever,” said Gandalf. “There are many things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep waters; <b>and</b> seas <b>and</b> lands may change. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not our part here <b>to</b> take <b>thought</b> only for a season, <b>or</b> for a few lives <b>of</b> Men, <b>or</b> for a passing age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. We should seek a final end <b>of</b> this menace, even if we <b>do</b> not hope <b>to</b> make one.”
<br>   “And that we shall not find <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea,” said Galdor. “If <b>the</b> return <b>to</b> Iarwain be <b>thought</b> too dangerous, then flight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> S‚a <b>is</b> now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> western way, when he learns <b>what</b> has befallen. He soon will. The Nine have been unhorsed indeed <b>but</b> that <b>is</b> <b>but</b> a respite, ere they find new steeds <b>and</b> swifter. Only <b>the</b> waning might <b>of</b> Gondor stands now between him <b>and</b> a march <b>in</b> power along <b>the</b> coasts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North; <b>and</b> if he comes, assailing <b>the</b> White Towers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Havens, hereafter <b>the</b> Elves may have <b>no</b> escape from <b>the</b> lengthening shadows <b>of</b> Middle-earth.”
<br>   “Long yet will that march be delayed,” said Boromir. “Gondor wanes, you say. But Gondor stands, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> its strength <b>is</b> still <b>very</b> strong.”
<br>   “And yet its vigilance can <b>no</b> longer keep back <b>the</b> Nine,” said Galdor. “And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.”
<br>   “Then,” said Erestor, “there are <b>but</b> two courses, as Glorfindel already has declared: <b>to</b> hide <b>the</b> Ring for ever; <b>or</b> <b>to</b> unmake <b>it</b>. But both are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?”
<br>   “None here can <b>do</b> so,” said Elrond gravely. “At least none can foretell <b>what</b> will come <b>to</b> pass, if we take this road <b>or</b> that. But <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> me now clear which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore <b>it</b> must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often <b>the</b> Elves have fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope <b>it</b> be. To walk <b>into</b> peril-<b>to</b> Mordor. We must send <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire.”
<br>   Silence fell again. Frodo, even <b>in</b> that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> clear waters, felt a dead darkness <b>in</b> his heart. Boromir stirred, <b>and</b> Frodo looked at him. He <b>was</b> fingering his great horn <b>and</b> frowning. At length he spoke.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand all this,” he said. “Saruman <b>is</b> a traitor, <b>but</b> did he not have a glimpse <b>of</b> wisdom? Why <b>do</b> you speak ever <b>of</b> hiding <b>and</b> destroying? Why should we not think that <b>the</b> Great Ring has come <b>into</b> our hands <b>to</b> serve us <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> hour <b>of</b> need? Wielding <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Free Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Free may surely defeat <b>the</b> Enemy. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he most fears, <b>I</b> deem.
<br>   “The Men <b>of</b> Gondor are valiant, <b>and</b> they will never submit; <b>but</b> they may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, <b>and</b> then a weapon. Let <b>the</b> Ring be your weapon, if <b>it</b> has such power as you say. Take <b>it</b> <b>and</b> go forth <b>to</b> victory!”
<br>   “Alas, <b>no</b>,” said Elrond. “We cannot <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs <b>to</b> Sauron <b>and</b> <b>was</b> made <b>by</b> him alone, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, <b>is</b> too great for anyone <b>to</b> wield at will, save only those who have already a great power <b>of</b> their own. But for them <b>it</b> holds an even deadlier peril. The <b>very</b> desire <b>of</b> <b>it</b> corrupts <b>the</b> heart. Consider Saruman. If any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wise should with this Ring overthrow <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself <b>on</b> Sauron's throne, <b>and</b> yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that <b>is</b> another reason why <b>the</b> Ring should be destroyed: as long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>it</b> will be a danger even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wise. For <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>. Even Sauron <b>was</b> not so. <b>I</b> fear <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> hide <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> will not take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> wield <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Nor <b>I</b>,” said Gandalf.
<br>   Boromir looked at them doubtfully, <b>but</b> he bowed his head. “So be <b>it</b>,” he said. “Then <b>in</b> Gondor we must trust <b>to</b> such weapons as we have. And at <b>the</b> least, while <b>the</b> Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight <b>on</b>. Mayhap <b>the</b> Sword-that-<b>was</b>-Broken may still stem <b>the</b> tide—if <b>the</b> hand that wields <b>it</b> has inherited not an heirloom only, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sinews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings <b>of</b> Men.”
<br>   “Who can tell?” said Aragorn. “But we will put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test one day.”
<br>   “May <b>the</b> day not be too long delayed,” said Boromir. “For though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask for aid, we need <b>it</b>. It would comfort us <b>to</b> know that others fought also with all <b>the</b> means that they have.”
<br>   “Then be comforted,” said Elrond. “For there are other powers <b>and</b> realms that you know not, <b>and</b> they are hidden from you. Anduin <b>the</b> Great flows past many shores, ere <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> Argonath <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Gondor.”
<br>   “Still <b>it</b> might be well for all,” said Gl?<b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf, “if all these strengths were joined, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> each were used <b>in</b> league. Other rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used <b>in</b> our need. The Seven are lost <b>to</b> us—if Balin has not found <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> Thr?r which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last; naught has been heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> since Thr?r perished <b>in</b> Moria. Indeed <b>I</b> may now reveal that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> partly <b>in</b> hope <b>to</b> find that ring that Balin went away.”
<br>   “Balin will find <b>no</b> ring <b>in</b> Moria,” said Gandalf. “Thr?r gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Thr?<b>in</b> his son, <b>but</b> not Thr?<b>in</b> <b>to</b> Thorin. It <b>was</b> taken with torment from Thr?<b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> Dol Guldur. <b>I</b> came too late.”
<br>   “Ah, alas!” cried Gl?<b>in</b>. “When will <b>the</b> day come <b>of</b> our revenge? But still there are <b>the</b> Three. What <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Rings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves? Very mighty Rings, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said. Do not <b>the</b> Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? <b>I</b> see Elf-lords here. Will they not say?”
<br>   The Elves returned <b>no</b> answer. “Did you not hear me, Gl?<b>in</b>?” said Elrond. “The Three were not made <b>by</b> Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But <b>of</b> them <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not permitted <b>to</b> speak. So much only <b>in</b> this hour <b>of</b> doubt <b>I</b> may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons <b>of</b> war <b>or</b> conquest: that <b>is</b> not their power. Those who made them did not desire strength <b>or</b> domination <b>or</b> hoarded wealth, <b>but</b> understanding, making, <b>and</b> healing, <b>to</b> preserve all things unstained. These things <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Middle-earth have <b>in</b> some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought <b>by</b> those who wield <b>the</b> Three will turn <b>to</b> their undoing, <b>and</b> their minds <b>and</b> hearts will become revealed <b>to</b> Sauron, if he regains <b>the</b> One. It would be better if <b>the</b> Three <b>had</b> never been. That <b>is</b> his purpose.”
<br>   “But <b>what</b> then would happen, if <b>the</b> Ruling Ring were destroyed as you counsel?” asked Gl?<b>in</b>.
<br>   “We know not for certain,” answered Elrond sadly. “Some hope that <b>the</b> Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, <b>and</b> their rulers might heal <b>the</b> hurts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world that he has wrought. But maybe when <b>the</b> One has gone, <b>the</b> Three will fail, <b>and</b> many fair things will fade <b>and</b> be forgotten. That <b>is</b> my belief.”
<br>   “Yet all <b>the</b> Elves are willing <b>to</b> endure this chance,” said Glorfindel “if <b>by</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Sauron may be broken, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> his dominion be taken away for ever.”
<br>   “Thus we return <b>once</b> more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> destroying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring,” said Erestor, “<b>and</b> yet we come <b>no</b> nearer. What strength have we for <b>the</b> finding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fire <b>in</b> which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made? That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> path <b>of</b> despair. Of folly <b>I</b> would say, if <b>the</b> long wisdom <b>of</b> Elrond did not forbid me.”
<br>   “Despair, <b>or</b> folly?” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> not despair, for despair <b>is</b> only for those who see <b>the</b> end beyond all doubt. We <b>do</b> not. It <b>is</b> wisdom <b>to</b> recognize necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly <b>it</b> may appear <b>to</b> those who cling <b>to</b> false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy! For he <b>is</b> <b>very</b> wise, <b>and</b> weighs all things <b>to</b> a nicety <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scales <b>of</b> his malice. But <b>the</b> only measure that he knows <b>is</b> desire, desire for power; <b>and</b> so he judges all hearts. Into his heart <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> will not enter that any will refuse <b>it</b>, that <b>having</b> <b>the</b> Ring we may seek <b>to</b> destroy <b>it</b>. If we seek this, we shall put him out <b>of</b> reckoning.”
<br>   “At least for a while,” said Elrond. “The road must be trod, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> will be <b>very</b> hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon <b>it</b>. This quest may be attempted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weak with as much hope as <b>the</b> strong. Yet such <b>is</b> oft <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> deeds that move <b>the</b> wheels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world: small hands <b>do</b> them because they must, while <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great are elsewhere.”
<br>   “Very well, <b>very</b> well, Master Elrond!” said Bilbo suddenly. “Say <b>no</b> more! It <b>is</b> plain enough <b>what</b> you are pointing at. Bilbo <b>the</b> silly hobbit started this affair, <b>and</b> Bilbo <b>had</b> better finish <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> himself. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> comfortable here, <b>and</b> getting <b>on</b> with my <b>book</b>. If you want <b>to</b> know, <b>I</b> am just writing an ending for <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> putting: <b>and</b> he lived happily ever afterwards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his days. It <b>is</b> a good ending, <b>and</b> none <b>the</b> worse for <b>having</b> been used before. Now <b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> alter that: <b>it</b> does not look like coming true; <b>and</b> anyway there will evidently have <b>to</b> be several more chapters, if <b>I</b> live <b>to</b> write them. It <b>is</b> a frightful nuisance. When ought <b>I</b> <b>to</b> start?
<br>   “Boromir looked <b>in</b> surprise at Bilbo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> laughter died <b>on</b> his lips when he saw that all <b>the</b> others regarded <b>the</b> old hobbit with grave respect. Only Gl?<b>in</b> smiled, <b>but</b> his smile came from old memories.
<br>   “Of course, my dear Bilbo,” said Gandalf. “If you <b>had</b> really started this affair, you might be expected <b>to</b> finish <b>it</b>. But you know well enough now that starting <b>is</b> too great a claim for any, <b>and</b> that only a small part <b>is</b> played <b>in</b> great deeds <b>by</b> any hero. You need not bow! Though <b>the</b> word <b>was</b> meant, <b>and</b> we <b>do</b> not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed <b>on</b>. If you need my advice any longer, <b>I</b> should say that your part <b>is</b> ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your <b>book</b>, <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> ending unaltered! There <b>is</b> still hope for <b>it</b>. But <b>get</b> ready <b>to</b> write a sequel, when they come back.”
<br>   Bilbo laughed. “<b>I</b> have never known you give me pleasant advice before.” he said. “As all your unpleasant advice has been good, <b>I</b> wonder if this advice <b>is</b> not bad. Still, <b>I</b> don't suppose <b>I</b> have <b>the</b> strength <b>or</b> luck left <b>to</b> deal with <b>the</b> Ring. It has grown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have not. But tell me: <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you mean <b>by</b> they?”
<br>   “The messengers who are sent with <b>the</b> Ring.”
<br>   “Exactly! And who are they <b>to</b> be? That seems <b>to</b> me <b>what</b> this Council has <b>to</b> decide, <b>and</b> all that <b>it</b> has <b>to</b> decide. Elves may thrive <b>on</b> speech alone, <b>and</b> Dwarves endure great weariness; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am only an old hobbit, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> miss my meal at noon. Can't you think <b>of</b> some names now? Or put <b>it</b> off till after dinner?”
<br>   No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still <b>no</b> one spoke. Frodo glanced at all <b>the</b> faces, <b>but</b> they were not turned <b>to</b> him. All <b>the</b> Council sat with downcast eyes, as if <b>in</b> deep <b>thought</b>. A great dread fell <b>on</b> him, as if he <b>was</b> awaiting <b>the</b> pronouncement <b>of</b> some doom that he <b>had</b> long foreseen <b>and</b> vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing <b>to</b> rest <b>and</b> remain at peace <b>by</b> Bilbo's side <b>in</b> Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, <b>and</b> wondered <b>to</b> hear his own words, as if some other will <b>was</b> using his small voice.
<br>   “<b>I</b> will take <b>the</b> Ring,” he said, “though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>the</b> way.”
<br>   Elrond raised his eyes <b>and</b> looked at him, <b>and</b> Frodo felt his heart pierced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden keenness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glance. “If <b>I</b> understand aright all that <b>I</b> have heard,” he said, “<b>I</b> think that this task <b>is</b> appointed for you, Frodo; <b>and</b> that if you <b>do</b> not find a way, <b>no</b> one will. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> hour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields <b>to</b> shake <b>the</b> towers <b>and</b> counsels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great. Who <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> Wise could have foreseen <b>it</b>? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect <b>to</b> know <b>it</b>, until <b>the</b> hour has struck?
<br>   “But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay <b>it</b> <b>on</b> another. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not lay <b>it</b> <b>on</b> you. But if you take <b>it</b> freely, <b>I</b> will say that your choice <b>is</b> right; <b>and</b> though all <b>the</b> mighty elf-friends <b>of</b> old, Hador, <b>and</b> H?rin, <b>and</b> T?rin, <b>and</b> Beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among them.”
<br>   “But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?” cried Sam, unable <b>to</b> contain himself any longer, <b>and</b> jumping up from <b>the</b> corner where he <b>had</b> been quietly <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor.
<br>   “No indeed!” said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. “You at least shall go with him. It <b>is</b> hardly possible <b>to</b> separate you from him, even when he <b>is</b> summoned <b>to</b> a secret council <b>and</b> you are not.”
<br>   Sam sat down, blushing <b>and</b> muttering. “A nice pickle we have landed ourselves <b>in</b>, Mr. Frodo!” he said, shaking his head.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 3
<br><b>THE</b> RING GOES SOUTH
<br>
<br>   Later that day <b>the</b> hobbits held a meeting <b>of</b> their own <b>in</b> Bilbo's room. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam <b>had</b> crept <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> been chosen as Frodo's companion.
<br>   “It's most unfair,” said Pippin. “Instead <b>of</b> throwing him out, <b>and</b> clapping him <b>in</b> chains, Elrond goes <b>and</b> rewards him for his cheek!”
<br>   “Rewards!” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> can't imagine a more severe punishment. You are not thinking <b>what</b> you are saying: condemned <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday <b>I</b> dreamed that my task <b>was</b> done, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't wonder,” said Merry, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you have <b>to</b> go, then <b>it</b> will be a punishment for any <b>of</b> us <b>to</b> be left behind, even <b>in</b> Rivendell. We have come a long way with you <b>and</b> been through some stiff times. We want <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>.”
<br>   “That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> meant,” said Pippin. “We hobbits ought <b>to</b> stick together, <b>and</b> we will. <b>I</b> shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be someone with intelligence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party.”
<br>   “Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!” said Gandalf, looking <b>in</b> through <b>the</b> window, which <b>was</b> near <b>the</b> ground. “But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing <b>is</b> decided yet.”
<br>   “Nothing decided!” cried Pippin. “Then <b>what</b> were you all doing? You were shut up for hours.”
<br>   "Talking,” said Bilbo. “There <b>was</b> a deal <b>of</b> talk, <b>and</b> everyone <b>had</b> an eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. <b>I</b> think Legolas's bit <b>of</b> news about Gollum caught even him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hop, though he passed <b>it</b> off.”
<br>   “You were wrong,” said Gandalf. “You were inattentive. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> from Gwaihir. If you want <b>to</b> know, <b>the</b> only real eye-openers, as you put <b>it</b>, were you <b>and</b> Frodo; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only one that <b>was</b> not surprised.”
<br>   “Well, anyway,” said Bilbo, “<b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> decided beyond choosing poor Frodo <b>and</b> Sam. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid all <b>the</b> time that <b>it</b> might come <b>to</b> that, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when <b>the</b> reports come <b>in</b>. Have they started yet, Gandalf?”
<br>   “Yes,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond <b>is</b> sending Elves, <b>and</b> they will <b>get</b> <b>in</b> touch with <b>the</b> Rangers, <b>and</b> maybe with Thranduil's folk <b>in</b> Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have <b>to</b> scour <b>the</b> lands all round for many long leagues before any move <b>is</b> made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably make quite a long stay here.”
<br>   “Ah!” said Sam gloomily. “We'll just wait long enough for winter <b>to</b> come.”
<br>   “That can't be helped,” said Bilbo. “It's your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting <b>on</b> waiting for my birthday. A funny way <b>of</b> honouring <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> can't help thinking. Not <b>the</b> day <b>I</b> should have chosen for letting <b>the</b> S.-B.s <b>into</b> Bag End. But there <b>it</b> <b>is</b>: you can't wait now fill spring; <b>and</b> you can't go till <b>the</b> reports come back.
<br>   
<br>When winter first begins <b>to</b> bite
<br><b>and</b> stones crack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frosty night,
<br>when pools are black <b>and</b> trees are bare,
<br>'tis evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wild <b>to</b> fare.
<br>   
<br>   But that <b>I</b> am afraid will be just your luck.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am afraid <b>it</b> will,” said Gandalf. “We can't start until we have found out about <b>the</b> Riders.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they were all destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flood,” said Merry.
<br>   “You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,” said Gandalf. “The power <b>of</b> their master <b>is</b> <b>in</b> them, <b>and</b> they stand <b>or</b> fall <b>by</b> him. We hope that they were all unhorsed <b>and</b> unmasked, <b>and</b> so made for a while less dangerous; <b>but</b> we must find out for certain. In <b>the</b> meantime you should try <b>and</b> forget your troubles, Frodo. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know if <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> anything <b>to</b> help you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> will whisper this <b>in</b> your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> party. He <b>was</b> right. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> shall come with you.”
<br>   So great <b>was</b> Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left <b>the</b> window-sill, where he <b>had</b> been <b>sitting</b>, <b>and</b> took off his hat <b>and</b> bowed. “<b>I</b> only said <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> shall come. Do not count <b>on</b> anything yet. In this matter Elrond will have much <b>to</b> say, <b>and</b> your friend <b>the</b> Strider. Which reminds me, <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> see Elrond. <b>I</b> must be off.”
<br>   “How long <b>do</b> you think <b>I</b> shall have here?” said Frodo <b>to</b> Bilbo when Gandalf <b>had</b> gone.
<br>   “Oh, <b>I</b> don't know. <b>I</b> can't count days <b>in</b> Rivendell,” said Bilbo. “But quite long, <b>I</b> should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping me with my <b>book</b>, <b>and</b> making a start <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next? Have you <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> an ending?”
<br>   “Yes, several, <b>and</b> all are dark <b>and</b> unpleasant,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Oh, that won't <b>do</b>!” said Bilbo. “Books ought <b>to</b> have good endings. How would this <b>do</b>: <b>and</b> they all settled down <b>and</b> lived together happily ever after?”
<br>   “It will <b>do</b> well, if <b>it</b> ever comes <b>to</b> that,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Ah!” said Sam. “And where will they live? That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> often wonder.”
<br>   For a while <b>the</b> hobbits continued <b>to</b> talk <b>and</b> think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past journey <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perils that lay ahead; <b>but</b> such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Rivendell that soon all fear <b>and</b> anxiety <b>was</b> lifted from their minds. The future, good <b>or</b> ill, <b>was</b> not forgotten, <b>but</b> ceased <b>to</b> have any power over <b>the</b> present. Health <b>and</b> hope grew strong <b>in</b> them, <b>and</b> they were content with each good day as <b>it</b> came, taking pleasure <b>in</b> every meal, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> every word <b>and</b> song.
<br>   So <b>the</b> days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright <b>and</b> fair, <b>and</b> each evening followed cool <b>and</b> clear. But autumn <b>was</b> waning fast; slowly <b>the</b> golden light faded <b>to</b> pale silver, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lingering leaves fell from <b>the</b> naked trees. A wind began <b>to</b> blow chill from <b>the</b> Misty Mountains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky, <b>and</b> put <b>to</b> flight all <b>the</b> lesser stars. But low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South one star shone red. Every night, as <b>the</b> Moon waned again, <b>it</b> shone brighter <b>and</b> brighter. Frodo could see <b>it</b> from his window, deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above <b>the</b> trees <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley.
<br>   The hobbits <b>had</b> been nearly two months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond, <b>and</b> November <b>had</b> gone <b>by</b> with <b>the</b> last shreds <b>of</b> autumn, <b>and</b> December <b>was</b> passing, when <b>the</b> scouts began <b>to</b> return. Some <b>had</b> gone north beyond <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hoarwell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Ettenmoors; <b>and</b> others <b>had</b> gone west, <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Rangers <b>had</b> searched <b>the</b> lands far down <b>the</b> Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where <b>the</b> old North Road crossed <b>the</b> river <b>by</b> a ruined town. Many <b>had</b> gone east <b>and</b> south; <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> these <b>had</b> crossed <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> entered Mirkwood, while others <b>had</b> climbed <b>the</b> pass at <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gladden River, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> come down <b>into</b> Wilderland <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> Gladden Fields <b>and</b> so at length <b>had</b> reached <b>the</b> old home <b>of</b> Radagast at Rhosgobel. Radagast <b>was</b> not there; <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> returned over <b>the</b> high pass that <b>was</b> called <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair. The sons <b>of</b> Elrond, Elladan <b>and</b> Elrohir, were <b>the</b> last <b>to</b> return; they <b>had</b> made a great journey, passing down <b>the</b> Silverlode <b>into</b> a strange country, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> their errand they would not speak <b>to</b> any save <b>to</b> Elrond.
<br>   In <b>no</b> region <b>had</b> <b>the</b> messengers discovered any signs <b>or</b> tidings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders <b>or</b> other servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Even from <b>the</b> Eagles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains they <b>had</b> learned <b>no</b> fresh news. Nothing <b>had</b> been seen <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> Gollum; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wild wolves were still gathering, <b>and</b> were hunting again far up <b>the</b> Great River. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black horses <b>had</b> been found at <b>once</b> drowned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flooded Ford. On <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapids below <b>it</b> searchers discovered <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> five more, <b>and</b> also a long black cloak, slashed <b>and</b> tattered. Of <b>the</b> Black Riders <b>no</b> other trace <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be seen, <b>and</b> nowhere <b>was</b> their presence <b>to</b> be felt. It seemed that they <b>had</b> vanished from <b>the</b> North.
<br>   “Eight out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine are accounted for at least,” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> rash <b>to</b> be too sure, yet <b>I</b> think that we may hope now that <b>the</b> Ringwraiths were scattered, <b>and</b> have been obliged <b>to</b> return as best they could <b>to</b> their Master <b>in</b> Mordor, empty <b>and</b> shapeless.
<br>   “If that <b>is</b> so, <b>it</b> will be some time before they can begin <b>the</b> hunt again. Of course <b>the</b> Enemy has other servants, <b>but</b> they will have <b>to</b> journey all <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that will be hard <b>to</b> find. But we must delay <b>no</b> longer.”
<br>   Elrond summoned <b>the</b> hobbits <b>to</b> him. He looked gravely at Frodo. “The time has come,” he said. “If <b>the</b> Ring <b>is</b> <b>to</b> set out, <b>it</b> must go soon. But those who go with <b>it</b> must not count <b>on</b> their errand being aided <b>by</b> war <b>or</b> force. They must pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy far from aid. Do you still hold <b>to</b> your word, Frodo, that you will be <b>the</b> Ring-bearer?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> will go with Sam.”
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> cannot help you much, not even with counsel,” said Elrond. “<b>I</b> can foresee <b>very</b> little <b>of</b> your road; <b>and</b> how your task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be achieved <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. The Shadow has crept now <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> draws nigh even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Greyflood; <b>and</b> under <b>the</b> Shadow all <b>is</b> dark <b>to</b> me. You will meet many foes, some open, <b>and</b> some disguised; <b>and</b> you may find friends upon your way when you least look for <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> will send out messages, such as <b>I</b> can contrive, <b>to</b> those whom <b>I</b> know <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide world; <b>but</b> so perilous are <b>the</b> lands now become that some may well miscarry, <b>or</b> come <b>no</b> quicker than you yourself.
<br>   “And <b>I</b> will choose you companions <b>to</b> go with you, as far as they will <b>or</b> fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope <b>is</b> <b>in</b> speed <b>and</b> secrecy. Had <b>I</b> a host <b>of</b> Elves <b>in</b> armour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>it</b> would avail little, save <b>to</b> arouse <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   “The Company <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring shall be Nine; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine Walkers shall be set against <b>the</b> Nine Riders that are evil. With you <b>and</b> your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, <b>and</b> maybe <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his labours.
<br>   “For <b>the</b> rest, they shall represent <b>the</b> other Free Peoples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World: Elves, Dwarves, <b>and</b> Men. Legolas shall be for <b>the</b> Elves; <b>and</b> Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b> for <b>the</b> Dwarves. They are willing <b>to</b> go at least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> passes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains, <b>and</b> maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn, for <b>the</b> Ring <b>of</b> Isildur concerns him closely.”
<br>   “Strider!” said Frodo.
<br>   “Yes,” he said with a smile. “<b>I</b> ask leave <b>once</b> again <b>to</b> be your companion, Frodo.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> would have begged you <b>to</b> come,” said Frodo, “only <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were going <b>to</b> Minas Tirith with Boromir.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am,” said Aragorn. “And <b>the</b> Sword-that-<b>was</b>-Broken shall be reforged ere <b>I</b> set out <b>to</b> war. But your road <b>and</b> our road lie together for many hundreds <b>of</b> miles. Therefore Boromir will also be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Company. He <b>is</b> a valiant man.”
<br>   “There remain two more <b>to</b> be found,” said Elrond. “These <b>I</b> will consider. Of my household <b>I</b> may find some that <b>it</b> seems good <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> send.”
<br>   “But that will leave <b>no</b> place for us!” cried Pippin <b>in</b> dismay. “We don't want <b>to</b> be left behind. We want <b>to</b> go with Frodo.”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> because you <b>do</b> not understand <b>and</b> cannot imagine <b>what</b> lies ahead,” said Elrond.
<br>   “Neither does Frodo,” said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. “Nor <b>do</b> any <b>of</b> us see clearly. It <b>is</b> true that if these hobbits understood <b>the</b> danger, they would not dare <b>to</b> go. But they would still wish <b>to</b> go, <b>or</b> wish that they dared, <b>and</b> be shamed <b>and</b> unhappy. <b>I</b> think, Elrond, that <b>in</b> this matter <b>it</b> would be well <b>to</b> trust rather <b>to</b> their friendship than <b>to</b> great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm <b>the</b> Dark Tower, nor open <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire <b>by</b> <b>the</b> power that <b>is</b> <b>in</b> him.”
<br>   “You speak gravely,” said Elrond, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>in</b> doubt. The Shire, <b>I</b> forebode, <b>is</b> not free now from peril; <b>and</b> these two <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> send back there as messengers, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they could, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fashion <b>of</b> their country, <b>to</b> warn <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> their danger. In any case, <b>I</b> judge that <b>the</b> younger <b>of</b> these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart <b>is</b> against his going.”
<br>   “Then, Master Elrond, you will have <b>to</b> lock me <b>in</b> prison, <b>or</b> send me home tied <b>in</b> a sack,” said Pippin. “For otherwise <b>I</b> shall follow <b>the</b> Company.”
<br>   “Let <b>it</b> be so then. You shall go,” said Elrond, <b>and</b> he sighed. “Now <b>the</b> tale <b>of</b> Nine <b>is</b> filled. In seven days <b>the</b> Company must depart.”
<br>   The Sword <b>of</b> Elendil <b>was</b> forged anew <b>by</b> Elvish smiths, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> its blade <b>was</b> traced a device <b>of</b> seven stars set between <b>the</b> crescent Moon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rayed Sun, <b>and</b> about them <b>was</b> written many runes; for Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> war upon <b>the</b> marches <b>of</b> Mordor. Very bright <b>was</b> that sword when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made whole again; <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun shone redly <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon shone cold, <b>and</b> its edge <b>was</b> hard <b>and</b> keen. And Aragorn gave <b>it</b> a new name <b>and</b> called <b>it</b> And?ril, Flame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West.
<br>   Aragorn <b>and</b> Gandalf walked together <b>or</b> sat speaking <b>of</b> their road <b>and</b> <b>the</b> perils they would meet; <b>and</b> they pondered <b>the</b> storied <b>and</b> figured maps <b>and</b> books <b>of</b> lore that were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elrond. Sometimes Frodo <b>was</b> with them; <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> content <b>to</b> lean <b>on</b> their guidance, <b>and</b> he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.
<br>   In those last days <b>the</b> hobbits sat together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hall <b>of</b> Fire, <b>and</b> there among many tales they heard told <b>in</b> full <b>the</b> lay <b>of</b> Beren <b>and</b> L?thien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> winning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Jewel; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day, while Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were out <b>and</b> about, Frodo <b>and</b> Sam were <b>to</b> be found with Bilbo <b>in</b> his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his <b>book</b> (which still seemed <b>very</b> incomplete). <b>or</b> scraps <b>of</b> his verses, <b>or</b> would take notes <b>of</b> Frodo's adventures.
<br>   On <b>the</b> morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last day Frodo <b>was</b> alone with Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted <b>the</b> lid <b>and</b> fumbled inside.
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> your sword,” he said. “But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> broken, you know. <b>I</b> took <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> safe <b>but</b> <b>I</b>'ve forgotten <b>to</b> ask if <b>the</b> smiths could mend <b>it</b>. No time now.. So <b>I</b> <b>thought</b>, perhaps, you would care <b>to</b> have this, don't you know?”
<br>   He took from <b>the</b> box a small sword <b>in</b> an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> its polished <b>and</b> well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold <b>and</b> bright. “This <b>is</b> Sting,” he said, <b>and</b> thrust <b>it</b> with little effort deep <b>into</b> a wooden beam. “Take <b>it</b>, if you like. <b>I</b> shan't want <b>it</b> again, <b>I</b> expect.”
<br>   Frodo accepted <b>it</b> gratefully.
<br>   “Also there <b>is</b> this!” said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed <b>to</b> be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds <b>of</b> old cloth, <b>and</b> held up a small shirt <b>of</b> mail. It <b>was</b> close-woven <b>of</b> many rings, as supple almost as linen, cold as ice, <b>and</b> harder than steel. It shone like moonlit silver, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> studded with white gems. With <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a belt <b>of</b> pearl <b>and</b> crystal.
<br>   “It's a pretty thing, isn't <b>it</b>?” said Bilbo, moving <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light. “And useful. It <b>is</b> my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. <b>I</b> got <b>it</b> back from Michel Delving before <b>I</b> started, <b>and</b> packed <b>it</b> with my luggage: <b>I</b> brought all <b>the</b> mementoes <b>of</b> my Journey away with me, except <b>the</b> Ring. But <b>I</b> did not expect <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't need <b>it</b> now, except <b>to</b> look at sometimes. You hardly feel any weight when you put <b>it</b> <b>on</b>.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> should look—well, <b>I</b> don't think <b>I</b> should look right <b>in</b> <b>it</b>,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said myself,” said Bilbo. “But never mind about looks. You can wear <b>it</b> under your outer clothes. Come <b>on</b>! You must share this secret with me. Don't tell anybody else! But <b>I</b> should feel happier if <b>I</b> knew you were wearing <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> have a fancy <b>it</b> would turn even <b>the</b> knives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Black Riders,” he ended <b>in</b> a low voice.
<br>   “Very well, <b>I</b> will take <b>it</b>,” said Frodo. Bilbo put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> him, <b>and</b> fastened Sting upon <b>the</b> glittering belt; <b>and</b> then Frodo put over <b>the</b> top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, <b>and</b> jacket.
<br>   “Just a plain hobbit you look,” said Bilbo. “But there <b>is</b> more about you now than appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface. Good luck <b>to</b> you!” He turned away <b>and</b> looked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, trying <b>to</b> hum a tune.
<br>   “<b>I</b> cannot thank you as <b>I</b> should, Bilbo, for this, <b>and</b> for all our past kindnesses,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Don't try!” said <b>the</b> old hobbit, turning round <b>and</b> slapping him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. “Ow!” he cried. “You are too hard now <b>to</b> slap! But there you are: Hobbits must stick together, <b>and</b> especially Bagginses. All <b>I</b> ask <b>in</b> return <b>is</b>: take as much care <b>of</b> yourself as you can. <b>and</b> bring back all <b>the</b> news you can, <b>and</b> any old songs <b>and</b> tales you can come <b>by</b>. <b>I</b>'ll <b>do</b> my best <b>to</b> finish my <b>book</b> before you return. <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> write <b>the</b> second <b>book</b>, if <b>I</b> am spared.” He broke off <b>and</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window again, singing softly.
<br>   
<br><b>I</b> sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> all that <b>I</b> have seen,
<br><b>of</b> meadow-flowers <b>and</b> butterflies
<br><b>in</b> summers that have been;
<br>
<br>Of yellow leaves <b>and</b> gossamer
<br><b>in</b> autumns that there were,
<br>with morning mist <b>and</b> silver sun
<br><b>and</b> wind upon my hair.
<br>
<br><b>I</b> sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> how <b>the</b> world will be
<br>when winter comes <b>without</b> a spring
<br>that <b>I</b> shall ever see.
<br>
<br>For still there are so many things
<br>that <b>I</b> have never seen:
<br><b>in</b> every wood <b>in</b> every spring
<br>there <b>is</b> a different green.
<br>
<br><b>I</b> sit beside <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> people long ago,
<br><b>and</b> people who will see a world
<br>that <b>I</b> shall never know.
<br>
<br>But all <b>the</b> while <b>I</b> sit <b>and</b> think
<br><b>of</b> times there were before,
<br><b>I</b> listen for returning feet
<br><b>and</b> voices at <b>the</b> door.
<br>   
<br>   It <b>was</b> a cold grey day near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> December. The East Wind <b>was</b> streaming through <b>the</b> bare branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> seething <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark pines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark <b>and</b> low. As <b>the</b> cheerless shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early evening began <b>to</b> fall <b>the</b> Company made ready <b>to</b> set out. They were <b>to</b> start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them <b>to</b> journey under cover <b>of</b> night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.
<br>   “You should fear <b>the</b> many eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> Sauron,” he said. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discomfiture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riders has already reached him, <b>and</b> he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies <b>on</b> foot <b>and</b> wing will be abroad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern lands. Even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky above you must beware as you go <b>on</b> your way.”
<br>   The Company took little gear <b>of</b> war, for their hope <b>was</b> <b>in</b> secrecy not <b>in</b> battle. Aragorn <b>had</b> And?ril <b>but</b> <b>no</b> other weapon, <b>and</b> he went forth clad only <b>in</b> rusty green <b>and</b> brown. as a Ranger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. Boromir <b>had</b> a long sword, <b>in</b> fashion like And?ril <b>but</b> <b>of</b> less lineage <b>and</b> he bore also a shield <b>and</b> his war-horn.
<br>   “Loud <b>and</b> clear <b>it</b> sounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valleys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills,” he said, “<b>and</b> then let all <b>the</b> foes <b>of</b> Gondor flee!” Putting <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his lips he blew a blast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> echoes leapt from rock <b>to</b> rock, <b>and</b> all that heard that voice <b>in</b> Rivendell sprang <b>to</b> their feet.
<br>   Slow should you be <b>to</b> wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond. “until you stand <b>once</b> more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> your land, <b>and</b> dire need <b>is</b> <b>on</b> you.”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Boromir. “But always <b>I</b> have let my horn cry at setting forth, <b>and</b> though thereafter we may walk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows, <b>I</b> will not go forth as a thief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night.”
<br>   Gimli <b>the</b> dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt <b>of</b> steel-rings, for dwarves make light <b>of</b> burdens; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> his belt <b>was</b> a broad-bladed axe. Legolas <b>had</b> a bow <b>and</b> a quiver, <b>and</b> at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore <b>the</b> swords that they <b>had</b> taken from <b>the</b> barrow; <b>but</b> Frodo took only Sting; <b>and</b> his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff, <b>but</b> girt at his side <b>was</b> <b>the</b> elven-sword Glamdring, <b>the</b> mate <b>of</b> Orcrist that lay now upon <b>the</b> breast <b>of</b> Thorin under <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain.
<br>   All were well furnished <b>by</b> Elrond with thick warm clothes, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> jackets <b>and</b> cloaks lined with fur. Spare food <b>and</b> clothes <b>and</b> blankets <b>and</b> other needs were laden <b>on</b> a pony, none other than <b>the</b> poor beast that they <b>had</b> brought from Bree.
<br>   ?he stay <b>in</b> Rivendell <b>had</b> worked a great wonder <b>of</b> change <b>on</b> him: he <b>was</b> glossy <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> vigour <b>of</b> youth. It <b>was</b> Sam who <b>had</b> insisted <b>on</b> choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, if he did not come.
<br>   “That animal can nearly talk,” he said, “<b>and</b> would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak <b>it</b>: if you don't let me go with you, Sam, <b>I</b>'ll follow <b>on</b> my own.” So Bill <b>was</b> going as <b>the</b> beast <b>of</b> burden, yet he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company that did not seem depressed.
<br>   Their farewells <b>had</b> been said <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great hall <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who <b>had</b> not yet come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. A gleam <b>of</b> firelight came from <b>the</b> open doors, <b>and</b> soft lights were glowing <b>in</b> many windows. Bilbo huddled <b>in</b> a cloak stood silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed <b>to</b> his knees; only Elrond knew fully <b>what</b> this hour meant <b>to</b> him. The others could be seen as grey shapes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness.
<br>   Sam <b>was</b> standing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pony, sucking his teeth, <b>and</b> staring moodily <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom where <b>the</b> river roared stonily below; his desire for adventure <b>was</b> at its lowest ebb.
<br>   “Bill, my lad,” he said, “you oughtn't <b>to</b> have took up with us. You could have stayed here <b>and</b> et <b>the</b> best hay till <b>the</b> new grass comes.” Bill swished his tail <b>and</b> said <b>nothing</b>.
<br>   Sam eased <b>the</b> pack <b>on</b> his shoulders, <b>and</b> went over anxiously <b>in</b> his mind all <b>the</b> things that he <b>had</b> stowed <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, wondering if he <b>had</b> forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little box <b>of</b> salt that he always carried <b>and</b> refilled when he could; a good supply <b>of</b> pipe-weed (<b>but</b> not near enough, <b>I</b>'ll warrant); flint <b>and</b> tinder; woollen hose: linen; various small belongings <b>of</b> his master's that Frodo <b>had</b> forgotten <b>and</b> Sam <b>had</b> stowed <b>to</b> bring them out <b>in</b> triumph when they were called for. He went through them all.
<br>   “Rope!” he muttered. “No rope! And only last night you said <b>to</b> yourself: “Sam, <b>what</b> about a bit <b>of</b> rope? You'll want <b>it</b>, if you haven't got <b>it</b>:” Well, <b>I</b>'ll want <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>it</b> now.”
<br>   At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, <b>and</b> he called <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> him. “This <b>is</b> my last word,” he said <b>in</b> a low voice. “The Ring-bearer <b>is</b> setting out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Quest <b>of</b> Mount Doom. On him alone <b>is</b> any charge laid: neither <b>to</b> cast away <b>the</b> Ring, nor <b>to</b> deliver <b>it</b> <b>to</b> any servant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy nor indeed <b>to</b> let any handle <b>it</b>, save members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Council, <b>and</b> only then <b>in</b> gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, <b>to</b> help him <b>on</b> his way. You may tarry, <b>or</b> come back, <b>or</b> turn aside <b>into</b> other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, <b>the</b> less easy will <b>it</b> be <b>to</b> withdraw; yet <b>no</b> oath <b>or</b> bond <b>is</b> laid <b>on</b> you <b>to</b> go further than you will. For you <b>do</b> not yet know <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> your hearts, <b>and</b> you cannot foresee <b>what</b> each may meet upon <b>the</b> road.”
<br>   “Faithless <b>is</b> he that says farewell when <b>the</b> road darkens,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Maybe,” said Elrond, “<b>but</b> let him not vow <b>to</b> walk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, who has not seen <b>the</b> nightfall.”
<br>   “Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Or break <b>it</b>,” said Elrond. “Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> blessing <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> all Free Folk go with you. May <b>the</b> stars shine upon your faces!”
<br>   “Good .. . good luck!” cried Bilbo, stuttering with <b>the</b> cold. “<b>I</b> don't suppose you will be able <b>to</b> keep a diary, Frodo my lad, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shall expect a full account when you <b>get</b> back. And don't be too long! Farewell!”
<br>   Many others <b>of</b> Elrond's household stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>and</b> watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> laughter, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> song <b>or</b> music. At last they turned away <b>and</b> faded silently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusk.
<br>   They crossed <b>the</b> bridge <b>and</b> wound slowly up <b>the</b> long steep paths that led out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cloven vale <b>of</b> Rivendell; <b>and</b> they came at length <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high moor where <b>the</b> wind hissed through <b>the</b> heather. Then with one glance at <b>the</b> Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   At <b>the</b> Ford <b>of</b> Bruinen they left <b>the</b> Road <b>and</b> turning southwards went <b>on</b> <b>by</b> narrow paths among <b>the</b> folded lands. Their purpose <b>was</b> <b>to</b> hold this course west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains for many miles <b>and</b> days. The country <b>was</b> much rougher <b>and</b> more barren than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green vale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River <b>in</b> Wilderland <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range, <b>and</b> their going would be slow; <b>but</b> they hoped <b>in</b> this way <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> notice <b>of</b> unfriendly eyes. The spies <b>of</b> Sauron <b>had</b> hitherto seldom been seen <b>in</b> this empty country, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paths were little known except <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> Rivendell.
<br>   Gandalf walked <b>in</b> front, <b>and</b> with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. The others were <b>in</b> file behind, <b>and</b> Legolas whose eyes were keen <b>was</b> <b>the</b> rearguard. The first part <b>of</b> their journey <b>was</b> hard <b>and</b> dreary, <b>and</b> Frodo remembered little <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, save <b>the</b> wind. For many sunless days an icy blast came from <b>the</b> Mountains <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> garment seemed able <b>to</b> keep out its searching fingers. Though <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving <b>or</b> at rest. They slept uneasily during <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, <b>in</b> some hollow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>or</b> hidden under <b>the</b> tangled thorn-bushes that grew <b>in</b> thickets <b>in</b> many places. In <b>the</b> late afternoon they were roused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> watch, <b>and</b> took their chief meal: cold <b>and</b> cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk <b>the</b> lighting <b>of</b> a fire. In <b>the</b> evening they went <b>on</b> again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.
<br>   At first <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits that although they walked <b>and</b> stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, <b>and</b> getting nowhere. Each day <b>the</b> land looked much <b>the</b> same as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> day before. Yet steadily <b>the</b> mountains were drawing nearer. South <b>of</b> Rivendell they rose ever higher, <b>and</b> bent westwards; <b>and</b> about <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main range there <b>was</b> tumbled an ever wider land <b>of</b> bleak hills, <b>and</b> deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few <b>and</b> winding, <b>and</b> led them often only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> some sheer fall, <b>or</b> down <b>into</b> treacherous swamps.
<br>   They <b>had</b> been a fortnight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way when <b>the</b> weather changed. The wind suddenly fell <b>and</b> then veered round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted <b>and</b> melted away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun came out, pale <b>and</b> bright. There came a cold clear dawn at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> a long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed <b>to</b> have been built out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> stone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills. Their dark leaves shone <b>and</b> their berries glowed red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rising sun.
<br>   Away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south Frodo could see <b>the</b> dim shapes <b>of</b> lofty mountains that seemed now <b>to</b> stand across <b>the</b> path that <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> taking. At <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> this high range rose three peaks; <b>the</b> tallest <b>and</b> nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice <b>was</b> still largely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow, <b>but</b> where <b>the</b> sunlight slanted upon <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> glowed red.
<br>   Gandalf stood at Frodo's side <b>and</b> looked out under his hand. “We have done well,” he said. “We have reached <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here <b>in</b> happier days, when Eregion <b>was</b> its name. Five-<b>and</b>-forty leagues as <b>the</b> crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet have walked. The land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weather will be milder now, <b>but</b> perhaps all <b>the</b> more dangerous.”
<br>   “Dangerous <b>or</b> not, a real sunrise <b>is</b> mighty welcome,” said Frodo, throwing back his hood <b>and</b> letting <b>the</b> morning light fall <b>on</b> his face.
<br>   “But <b>the</b> mountains are ahead <b>of</b> us,” said Pippin. “We must have turned eastwards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night.”
<br>   “No,” said Gandalf. “But you see further ahead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clear light. Beyond those peaks <b>the</b> range bends round south-west. There are many maps <b>in</b> Elrond's house, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> suppose you never <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> look at them?”
<br>   “Yes <b>I</b> did, sometimes,” said Pippin, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't remember them. Frodo has a better head for that sort <b>of</b> thing.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> need <b>no</b> map,” said Gimli, who <b>had</b> come up with Legolas, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> gazing out before him with a strange light <b>in</b> his deep eyes. “There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> land where our fathers worked <b>of</b> old, <b>and</b> we have wrought <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> those mountains <b>into</b> many works <b>of</b> metal <b>and</b> <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> <b>into</b> many songs <b>and</b> tales. They stand tall <b>in</b> our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shath?r.
<br>   “Only <b>once</b> before have <b>I</b> seen them from afar <b>in</b> waking life, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> know them <b>and</b> their names, for under them lies Khazad-d?m, <b>the</b> Dwarrowdelf, that <b>is</b> now called <b>the</b> Black Pit, Moria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, <b>the</b> Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; <b>and</b> beyond him are Silvertine <b>and</b> Cloudyhead: Celebdil <b>the</b> White, <b>and</b> Fanuidhol <b>the</b> Grey, that we call Zirak-zigil <b>and</b> Bundushath?r.
<br>   “There <b>the</b> Misty Mountains divide, <b>and</b> between their arms lies <b>the</b> deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale, which <b>the</b> Elves call Nanduhirion.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> for <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale that we are making,” said Gandalf. “If we climb <b>the</b> pass that <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, under <b>the</b> far side <b>of</b> Caradhras, we shall come down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep vale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves. There lies <b>the</b> Mirrormere, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> River Silverlode rises <b>in</b> its icy springs.”
<br>   “Dark <b>is</b> <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> Kheled-z?ram,” said Gimli, “<b>and</b> cold are <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> Kibil-n?la. My heart trembles at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> may see them soon.”
<br>   “May you have joy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight, my good dwarf l” said Gandalf. “But whatever you may <b>do</b>, we at least cannot stay <b>in</b> that valley. We must go down <b>the</b> Silverlode <b>into</b> <b>the</b> secret woods, <b>and</b> so <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great River, <b>and</b> then –”
<br>   He paused.
<br>   “Yes, <b>and</b> where then?” asked Merry.
<br>   “To <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey—<b>in</b> <b>the</b> end,” said Gandalf. “We cannot look too far ahead. Let us be glad that <b>the</b> first stage <b>is</b> safely over. <b>I</b> think we will rest here, not only today <b>but</b> tonight as well. There <b>is</b> a wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before <b>it</b> wholly forgets <b>the</b> Elves, if <b>once</b> they dwelt there.”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> true,” said Legolas. “But <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> this land were <b>of</b> a race strange <b>to</b> us <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silvan folk, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>do</b> not now remember them: Only <b>I</b> hear <b>the</b> stones lament them: deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; <b>but</b> they are gone. They are gone. They sought <b>the</b> Havens long ago.”
<br>   That morning they lit a fire <b>in</b> a deep hollow shrouded <b>by</b> great bushes <b>of</b> holly, <b>and</b> their supper-breakfast <b>was</b> merrier than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been since they set out. They did not hurry <b>to</b> bed afterwards, for they expected <b>to</b> have all <b>the</b> night <b>to</b> sleep <b>in</b>, <b>and</b> they did not mean <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again until <b>the</b> evening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next day. Only Aragorn <b>was</b> silent <b>and</b> restless. After a while he left <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> wandered <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ridge; there he stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> a tree, looking out southwards <b>and</b> westwards, with his head posed as if he <b>was</b> listening. Then he returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell <b>and</b> looked down at <b>the</b> others laughing <b>and</b> talking.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> matter, Strider?” Merry called up. “What are you looking for? Do you miss <b>the</b> East Wind?”
<br>   “No indeed,” he answered. “But <b>I</b> miss something. <b>I</b> have been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country <b>of</b> Hollin <b>in</b> many seasons. No folk dwell here now, <b>but</b> many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things <b>but</b> you are silent. <b>I</b> can feel <b>it</b>. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> sound for miles about us, <b>and</b> your voices seem <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> ground echo. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. “But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you guess <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason?” he asked. “Is there more <b>in</b> <b>it</b> than surprise at seeing four hobbits, not <b>to</b> mention <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> us, where people are so seldom seen <b>or</b> heard?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> hope that <b>is</b> <b>it</b>,” answered Aragorn. “But <b>I</b> have a sense <b>of</b> watchfulness, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> fear, that <b>I</b> have never <b>had</b> here before.”
<br>   "Then we must be more careful,” said Gandalf. “If you bring a Ranger with you, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well <b>to</b> pay attention <b>to</b> him, especially if <b>the</b> Ranger <b>is</b> Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, <b>and</b> set <b>the</b> watch.”
<br>   It <b>was</b> Sam's turn that day <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> first watch, <b>but</b> Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then <b>the</b> silence grew until even Sam felt <b>it</b>. The breathing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pony's tail <b>and</b> <b>the</b> occasional movements <b>of</b> his feet became loud noises. Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence <b>was</b> around him, <b>and</b> over all hung a clear blue sky, as <b>the</b> Sun rode up from <b>the</b> East. Away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South a dark patch appeared, <b>and</b> grew, <b>and</b> drove north like flying smoke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   “What's that, Strider? It don't look like a cloud,” said Sam <b>in</b> a whisper <b>to</b> Aragorn. He made <b>no</b> answer, he <b>was</b> gazing intently at <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> before long Sam could see for himself <b>what</b> <b>was</b> approaching. Flocks <b>of</b> birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling <b>and</b> circling, <b>and</b> traversing all <b>the</b> land as if they were searching for something; <b>and</b> they were steadily drawing nearer.
<br>   “Lie flat <b>and</b> still!” hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shade <b>of</b> a holly-bush; for a whole regiment <b>of</b> birds <b>had</b> broken away suddenly from <b>the</b> main host, <b>and</b> came, flying low, straight towards <b>the</b> ridge. Sam <b>thought</b> they were a kind <b>of</b> crow <b>of</b> large size. As they passed overhead, <b>in</b> so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over <b>the</b> ground below, one harsh croak <b>was</b> heard.
<br>   Not until they <b>had</b> dwindled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance, north <b>and</b> west, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up <b>and</b> went <b>and</b> wakened Gandalf.
<br>   “Regiments <b>of</b> black crows are flying over all <b>the</b> land between <b>the</b> Mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood,” he said, “<b>and</b> they have passed over Hollin. They are not natives here; they are crebain out <b>of</b> Fangorn <b>and</b> Dunland. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> they are about: possibly there <b>is</b> some trouble away south from which they are fleeing; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think they are spying out <b>the</b> land. <b>I</b> have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. <b>I</b> think we ought <b>to</b> move again this evening. Hollin <b>is</b> <b>no</b> longer wholesome for us: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> being watched.”
<br>   “And <b>in</b> that case so <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> how we can <b>get</b> over that <b>without</b> being seen, <b>I</b> cannot imagine. But we will think <b>of</b> that when we must. As for moving as soon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> dark, <b>I</b> am afraid that you are right.”
<br>   “Luckily our fire made little smoke, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> burned low before <b>the</b> crebain came,” said Aragorn. “It must be put out <b>and</b> not lit again.”
<br>   “Well if that isn't a plague <b>and</b> a nuisance!” said Pippin. The news: <b>no</b> fire, <b>and</b> a move again <b>by</b> night, <b>had</b> been broken <b>to</b> him, as soon as he woke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late afternoon. “All because <b>of</b> a pack <b>of</b> crows! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked forward <b>to</b> a real good meal tonight: something hot.”
<br>   “Well, you can go <b>on</b> looking forward,” said Gandalf. “There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself <b>I</b> should like a pipe <b>to</b> smoke <b>in</b> comfort, <b>and</b> warmer feet. However, we are certain <b>of</b> one thing at any rate: <b>it</b> will <b>get</b> warmer as we <b>get</b> south.”
<br>   “Too warm, <b>I</b> shouldn't wonder,” muttered Sam <b>to</b> Frodo. “But <b>I</b>'m <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> think <b>it</b>'s time we got a sight <b>of</b> that Fiery Mountain <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Road, so <b>to</b> speak. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> at first that this here Redhorn, <b>or</b> whatever its name <b>is</b>, might be <b>it</b>, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!” Maps conveyed <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> Sam's mind, <b>and</b> all distances <b>in</b> these strange lands seemed so vast that he <b>was</b> quite out <b>of</b> his reckoning.
<br>   All that day <b>the</b> Company remained <b>in</b> hiding. The dark birds passed over now <b>and</b> again; <b>but</b> as <b>the</b> westering Sun grew red they disappeared southwards. At dusk <b>the</b> Company set out, <b>and</b> turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vanished Sun. One <b>by</b> one white stars sprang forth as <b>the</b> sky faded.
<br>   Guided <b>by</b> Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked <b>to</b> Frodo like <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> an ancient road, that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been broad <b>and</b> well planned, from Hollin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain-pass. The Moon, now at <b>the</b> full, rose over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> cast a pale light <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> shadows <b>of</b> stones were black. Many <b>of</b> them looked <b>to</b> have been worked <b>by</b> hands, though now they lay tumbled <b>and</b> ruinous <b>in</b> a bleak, barren land.
<br>   It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cold chill hour before <b>the</b> first stir <b>of</b> dawn, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moon <b>was</b> low. Frodo looked up at <b>the</b> sky. Suddenly he saw <b>or</b> felt a shadow pass over <b>the</b> high stars, as if for a moment they faded <b>and</b> then flashed out again. He shivered.
<br>   “Did you see anything pass over?” he whispered <b>to</b> Gandalf, who <b>was</b> just ahead.
<br>   “No, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> felt <b>it</b>, whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b>,” he answered. “It may be <b>nothing</b>, only a wisp <b>of</b> thin cloud.”
<br>   “It <b>was</b> moving fast then,” muttered Aragorn, “<b>and</b> not with <b>the</b> wind.”
<br>   Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even brighter than before. But <b>the</b> air <b>was</b> chill again; already <b>the</b> wind <b>was</b> turning back towards <b>the</b> east. For two more nights they marched <b>on</b>, climbing steadily <b>but</b> ever more slowly as their road wound up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountains towered up, nearer <b>and</b> nearer. On <b>the</b> third morning Caradhras rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, <b>but</b> with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a black look <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> wan. The wind <b>had</b> gone now round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north-east. Gandalf snuffed <b>the</b> air <b>and</b> looked back.
<br>   “Winter deepens behind us,” he said quietly <b>to</b> Aragorn. “The heights away north are whiter than they were; snow <b>is</b> lying far down their shoulders. Tonight we shall be <b>on</b> our way high up towards <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate. We may well be seen <b>by</b> watchers <b>on</b> that narrow path, <b>and</b> waylaid <b>by</b> some evil; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What <b>do</b> you think <b>of</b> your course now, Aragorn?”
<br>   Frodo overheard these words, <b>and</b> understood that Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn were continuing some debate that <b>had</b> begun long before. He listened anxiously.
<br>   “<b>I</b> think <b>no</b> good <b>of</b> our course from <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end, as you know well, Gandalf,” answered Aragorn. “And perils known <b>and</b> unknown will grow as we go <b>on</b>. But we must go <b>on</b>; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good our delaying <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. Further south there are <b>no</b> passes, till one comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not trust that way since your news <b>of</b> Saruman. Who knows which side now <b>the</b> marshals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse-lords serve?”
<br>   “Who knows indeed!” said Gandalf. “But there <b>is</b> another way, <b>and</b> not <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pass <b>of</b> Caradhras: <b>the</b> dark <b>and</b> secret way that we have spoken <b>of</b>.”
<br>   “But let us not speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again! Not yet. Say <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others <b>I</b> beg, not until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> plain that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other way.”
<br>   “We must decide before we go further,” answered Gandalf.
<br>   “Then let us weigh <b>the</b> matter <b>in</b> our minds, while <b>the</b> others rest <b>and</b> sleep,” said Aragorn.
<br>   In <b>the</b> late afternoon, while <b>the</b> others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn went aside together <b>and</b> stood looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark <b>and</b> sullen, <b>and</b> its head <b>was</b> <b>in</b> grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which way <b>the</b> debate would go. When they returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company Gandalf spoke, <b>and</b> then he knew that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been decided <b>to</b> face <b>the</b> weather <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high pass. He <b>was</b> relieved. He could not guess <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> other dark <b>and</b> secret way, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> mention <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> seemed <b>to</b> fill Aragorn with dismay, <b>and</b> Frodo <b>was</b> glad that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned.
<br>   “From signs that we have seen lately,” said Gandalf, “<b>I</b> fear that <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate may be watched; <b>and</b> also <b>I</b> have doubts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather that <b>is</b> coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all <b>the</b> speed that we can. Even so <b>it</b> will take us more than two marches before we reach <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can <b>get</b> ready.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will add a word <b>of</b> advice, if <b>I</b> may,” said Boromir. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> born under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains <b>and</b> know something <b>of</b> journeys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if <b>no</b> worse, before we come down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side. It will not help us <b>to</b> keep so secret that we are frozen <b>to</b> death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees <b>and</b> bushes, each <b>of</b> us should carry a faggot <b>of</b> wood, as large as he can bear.”
<br>   “And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?” said Sam. The pony looked at him mournfully.
<br>   “Very well,” said Gandalf. “But we must not <b>use</b> <b>the</b> wood—not unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a choice between fire <b>and</b> death.”
<br>   The Company set out again with good speed at first; <b>but</b> soon their way became steep <b>and</b> difficult. The twisting <b>and</b> climbing road <b>had</b> <b>in</b> many places almost disappeared, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> blocked with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among <b>the</b> rocks. By midnight they <b>had</b> climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall <b>of</b> cliffs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, above which <b>the</b> grim flanks <b>of</b> Caradhras towered up invisible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>was</b> a gulf <b>of</b> darkness where <b>the</b> land fell suddenly <b>into</b> a deep ravine.
<br>   Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope <b>and</b> halted for a moment at <b>the</b> top. Frodo felt a soft touch <b>on</b> his face. He put out his arm <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> dim white flakes <b>of</b> snow settling <b>on</b> his sleeve.
<br>   They went <b>on</b>. But before long <b>the</b> snow <b>was</b> falling fast, filling all <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> swirling <b>into</b> Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn only a pace <b>or</b> two ahead could hardly be seen.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't like this at all,” panted Sam just behind. “Snow's all right <b>on</b> a fine morning, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> like <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> bed while <b>it</b>'s falling. <b>I</b> wish this lot would go off <b>to</b> Hobbiton! Folk might welcome <b>it</b> there.” Except <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high moors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northfarthing a heavy fall <b>was</b> rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> regarded as a pleasant event <b>and</b> a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo) could remember <b>the</b> Fell Winter <b>of</b> 1311, when <b>the</b> white wolves invaded <b>the</b> Shire over <b>the</b> frozen Brandywine.
<br>   Gandalf halted. Snow <b>was</b> thick <b>on</b> his hood <b>and</b> shoulders; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> already ankle-deep about his boots.
<br>   "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feared,” he said. “What <b>do</b> you say now, Aragorn?”
<br>   “That <b>I</b> feared <b>it</b> too,” Aragorn answered, “<b>but</b> less than other things. <b>I</b> knew <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> snow, though <b>it</b> seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where <b>the</b> paths are usually open all <b>the</b> winter.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder if this <b>is</b> a contrivance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy,” said Boromir. “They say <b>in</b> my land that he can govern <b>the</b> storms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Shadow that stand upon <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> Mordor. He has strange powers <b>and</b> many allies.”
<br>   “His arm has grown long indeed,” said Gimli, “if he can draw snow down from <b>the</b> North <b>to</b> trouble us here three hundred leagues away.”
<br>   “His arm has grown long,” said Gandalf.
<br>   While they were halted, <b>the</b> wind died down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow slackened until <b>it</b> almost ceased. They tramped <b>on</b> again. But they <b>had</b> not gone more than a furlong when <b>the</b> storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found <b>it</b> hard <b>to</b> keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind <b>the</b> taller folk, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> plain that they could not go much further, if <b>the</b> snow continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin <b>was</b> dragging behind. Even Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, <b>was</b> grumbling as he trudged.
<br>   The Company halted suddenly, as if they <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> an agreement <b>without</b> any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness round them. It may have been only a trick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cracks <b>and</b> gullies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocky wall, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sounds were those <b>of</b> shrill cries, <b>and</b> wild howls <b>of</b> laughter. Stones began <b>to</b> fall from <b>the</b> mountain-side, whistling over their heads, <b>or</b> crashing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path beside them. Every now <b>and</b> again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from hidden heights above.
<br>   “We cannot go further tonight,” said Boromir. “Let those call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> wind who will; there are fell voices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air; <b>and</b> these stones are aimed at us.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> call <b>it</b> <b>the</b> wind,” said Aragorn. “But that does not make <b>what</b> you say untrue. There are many evil <b>and</b> unfriendly things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world that have little love for those that go <b>on</b> two legs, <b>and</b> yet are not <b>in</b> league with Sauron, <b>but</b> have purposes <b>of</b> their own. Some have been <b>in</b> this world longer than he.”
<br>   “Caradhras <b>was</b> called <b>the</b> Cruel, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> an ill name, said Gimli, “long years ago, when rumour <b>of</b> Sauron <b>had</b> not been heard <b>in</b> these lands.”
<br>   “It matters little who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack; said Gandalf.
<br>   “But <b>what</b> can we <b>do</b>?” cried Pippin miserably. He <b>was</b> leaning <b>on</b> Merry <b>and</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> shivering.
<br>   “Either stop where we are, <b>or</b> go back,” said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good going <b>on</b>. Only a little higher, if <b>I</b> remember rightly, this path leaves <b>the</b> cliff <b>and</b> runs <b>into</b> a wide shallow trough at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a long hard slope. We should have <b>no</b> shelter there from snow, <b>or</b> stones—<b>or</b> anything else.”
<br>   “And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good going back while <b>the</b> storm holds,” said Aragorn. “We have passed <b>no</b> place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now.”
<br>   “Shelter!” muttered Sam. “If this <b>is</b> shelter, then one wall <b>and</b> <b>no</b> roof make a house.”
<br>   The Company now gathered together as close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliff as they could. It faced southwards, <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> bottom <b>it</b> leaned out a little, so that they hoped <b>it</b> would give them some protection from <b>the</b> northerly wind <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow flowed down <b>in</b> ever denser clouds.
<br>   They huddled together with their backs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. Bill <b>the</b> pony stood patiently <b>but</b> dejectedly <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits, <b>and</b> screened them a little; <b>but</b> before long <b>the</b> drifting snow <b>was</b> above his hocks, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> went <b>on</b> mounting. If they <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> larger companions <b>the</b> hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.
<br>   A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast <b>into</b> a warm <b>and</b> hazy dream. He <b>thought</b> a fire <b>was</b> heating his toes, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. <b>I</b> don't think much <b>of</b> your diary, he said. Snowstorms <b>on</b> January <b>the</b> twelfth: there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> come back <b>to</b> report that!
<br>   But <b>I</b> wanted rest <b>and</b> sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, <b>and</b> he came back painfully <b>to</b> wakefulness. Boromir <b>had</b> lifted him off <b>the</b> ground out <b>of</b> a nest <b>of</b> snow.
<br>   “This will be <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> halflings, Gandalf,” said Boromir. “It <b>is</b> useless <b>to</b> sit here until <b>the</b> snow goes over our heads. We must <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> save ourselves.”
<br>   “Give them this,” said Gandalf, searching <b>in</b> his pack <b>and</b> drawing out a leathern flask. “Just a mouthful each—for all <b>of</b> us. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> precious. It <b>is</b> miruvor, <b>the</b> cordial <b>of</b> Imladris. Elrond gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me at our parting. Pass <b>it</b> round!”
<br>   As soon as Frodo <b>had</b> swallowed a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> warm <b>and</b> fragrant liquor he felt a new strength <b>of</b> heart, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived <b>and</b> found fresh hope <b>and</b> vigour. But <b>the</b> snow did not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind blew louder.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you say <b>to</b> fire?” asked Boromir suddenly. “The choice seems near now between fire <b>and</b> death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when <b>the</b> snow has covered us, <b>but</b> that will not help us.”
<br>   “You may make a fire, if you can,” answered Gandalf. “If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire <b>or</b> <b>no</b>.” But though they <b>had</b> brought wood <b>and</b> kindlings <b>by</b> <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Boromir, <b>it</b> passed <b>the</b> skill <b>of</b> Elf <b>or</b> even Dwarf <b>to</b> strike a flame that would hold amid <b>the</b> swirling wind <b>or</b> catch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held <b>it</b> aloft for a moment, <b>and</b> then with a word <b>of</b> command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his staff <b>into</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. At <b>once</b> a great spout <b>of</b> green <b>and</b> blue flame sprang out, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wood flared <b>and</b> sputtered.
<br>   “If there are any <b>to</b> see, then <b>I</b> at least am revealed <b>to</b> them,” he said. “<b>I</b> have written Gandalf <b>is</b> here <b>in</b> signs that all can read from Rivendell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> Anduin.”
<br>   But <b>the</b> Company cared <b>no</b> longer for watchers <b>or</b> unfriendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire. The wood burned merrily; <b>and</b> though all round <b>it</b> <b>the</b> snow hissed, <b>and</b> pools <b>of</b> slush crept under their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at <b>the</b> blaze. There they stood, stooping <b>in</b> a circle round <b>the</b> little dancing <b>and</b> blowing flames. A red light <b>was</b> <b>on</b> their <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> anxious faces; behind them <b>the</b> night <b>was</b> like a black wall.
<br>   But <b>the</b> wood <b>was</b> burning fast, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> snow still fell.
<br>   The fire burned low. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last faggot <b>was</b> thrown <b>on</b>.
<br>   The night <b>is</b> getting old,” said Aragorn. “The dawn <b>is</b> not far off.”
<br>   “If any dawn can pierce these clouds,” said Gimli.
<br>   Boromir stepped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle <b>and</b> stared up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> blackness. “The snow <b>is</b> growing less,” he said, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>is</b> quieter.”
<br>   Frodo gazed wearily at <b>the</b> flakes still falling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>to</b> be revealed white for a moment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dying fire; <b>but</b> for a long time he could see <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> creep over him again, he <b>was</b> aware that <b>the</b> wind <b>had</b> indeed fallen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flakes were becoming larger <b>and</b> fewer. Very slowly a dim light began <b>to</b> grow. At last <b>the</b> snow stopped altogether.
<br>   As <b>the</b> light grew stronger <b>it</b> showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were white humps <b>and</b> domes <b>and</b> shapeless deeps beneath which <b>the</b> path that they <b>had</b> trodden <b>was</b> altogether lost; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> heights above were hidden <b>in</b> great clouds still heavy with <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> snow.
<br>   Gimli looked up <b>and</b> shook his head. “Caradhras has not forgiven us.” he said. “He has more snow yet <b>to</b> fling at us, if we go <b>on</b>. The sooner we go back <b>and</b> down <b>the</b> better.”
<br>   To this all agreed, <b>but</b> their retreat <b>was</b> now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from <b>the</b> ashes <b>of</b> their fire <b>the</b> snow lay many feet deep, higher than <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits; <b>in</b> places <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been scooped <b>and</b> piled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>into</b> great drifts against <b>the</b> cliff.
<br>   “If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,” said Legolas. The storm <b>had</b> troubled him little, <b>and</b> he alone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company remained still light <b>of</b> heart.
<br>   “If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch <b>the</b> Sun <b>to</b> save us,” answered Gandalf. “But <b>I</b> must have something <b>to</b> work <b>on</b>. <b>I</b> cannot burn snow.”
<br>   “Well,” said Boromir, “when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say <b>in</b> my country. The strongest <b>of</b> us must seek a way. See! Though all <b>is</b> now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder <b>of</b> rock down yonder. It <b>was</b> there that <b>the</b> snow first began <b>to</b> burden us. If we could reach that point, maybe <b>it</b> would prove easier beyond. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> more than a furlong off, <b>I</b> guess.”
<br>   “Then let us force a path thither, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b>!” said Aragorn.
<br>   Aragorn <b>was</b> <b>the</b> tallest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>but</b> Boromir, little less <b>in</b> height, <b>was</b> broader <b>and</b> heavier <b>in</b> build. He led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, <b>and</b> were soon toiling heavily. In places <b>the</b> snow <b>was</b> breast-high, <b>and</b> often Boromir seemed <b>to</b> be swimming <b>or</b> burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.
<br>   Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, <b>and</b> then he turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “The strongest must seek a way, say you? But <b>I</b> say: let a ploughman plough, <b>but</b> choose an otter for swimming, <b>and</b> for running light over grass <b>and</b> leaf <b>or</b> over snow-an Elf.”
<br>   With that he sprang forth nimbly, <b>and</b> then Frodo noticed as if for <b>the</b> first time, though he <b>had</b> long known <b>it</b>, that <b>the</b> Elf <b>had</b> <b>no</b> boots, <b>but</b> wore only light shoes, as he always did, <b>and</b> his feet made little imprint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow.
<br>   “Farewell!” he said <b>to</b> Gandalf. “<b>I</b> go <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Sun!” Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, <b>and</b> quickly overtaking <b>the</b> toiling men, with a wave <b>of</b> his hand he passed them, <b>and</b> sped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> vanished round <b>the</b> rocky turn.
<br>   The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn dwindled <b>into</b> black specks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whiteness. At length they too passed from sight. The time dragged <b>on</b>. The clouds lowered, <b>and</b> now a few flakes <b>of</b> snow came curling down again.
<br>   An hour, maybe, went <b>by</b>, though <b>it</b> seemed far longer, <b>and</b> then at last they saw Legolas coming back. At <b>the</b> same time Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn reappeared round <b>the</b> bend far behind him <b>and</b> came labouring up <b>the</b> slope.
<br>   “Well,” cried Legolas as he ran up, “<b>I</b> have not brought <b>the</b> Sun. She <b>is</b> walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blue fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> a little wreath <b>of</b> snow <b>on</b> this Redhorn hillock troubles <b>her</b> not at all. But <b>I</b> have brought back a gleam <b>of</b> good hope for those who are doomed <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> feet. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> greatest wind-drift <b>of</b> all just beyond <b>the</b> turn, <b>and</b> there our Strong Men were almost buried. They despaired, until <b>I</b> returned <b>and</b> told them that <b>the</b> drift <b>was</b> little wider than a wall. And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> snow suddenly grows less, while further down <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> more than a white coverlet <b>to</b> cool a hobbit's toes.”
<br>   “Ah, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> as <b>I</b> said,” growled Gimli. “It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> ordinary storm. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ill will <b>of</b> Caradhras. He does not love Elves <b>and</b> Dwarves, <b>and</b> that drift <b>was</b> laid <b>to</b> cut off our escape.”
<br>   “But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,” said Boromir, who came up at that moment. “And doughty Men too, if <b>I</b> may say <b>it</b>; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane through <b>the</b> drift; <b>and</b> for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.”
<br>   “But how are we <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down there, even if you have cut through <b>the</b> drift?” said Pippin, voicing <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “Have hope!” said Boromir. “<b>I</b> am weary, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> still have some strength left, <b>and</b> Aragorn too. We will bear <b>the</b> little folk. The others <b>no</b> doubt will make shift <b>to</b> tread <b>the</b> path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! <b>I</b> will begin with you.”
<br>   He lifted up <b>the</b> hobbit. “Cling <b>to</b> my back! <b>I</b> shall need my arms” he said <b>and</b> strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing <b>the</b> passage that he <b>had</b> already forced with <b>no</b> other tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he <b>was</b>, he <b>was</b> widening <b>the</b> track for those who followed, thrusting <b>the</b> snow aside as he went.
<br>   They came at length <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great drift. It <b>was</b> flung across <b>the</b> mountain-path like a sheer <b>and</b> sudden wall, <b>and</b> its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> Boromir; <b>but</b> through <b>the</b> middle a passage <b>had</b> been beaten, rising <b>and</b> falling like a bridge. On <b>the</b> far side Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were set down, <b>and</b> there they waited with Legolas for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> arrive.
<br>   After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow <b>but</b> now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among <b>the</b> baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through <b>the</b> lane; <b>but</b> hardly <b>had</b> Frodo touched <b>the</b> ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall <b>of</b> stones <b>and</b> slithering snow. The spray <b>of</b> <b>it</b> half blinded <b>the</b> Company as they crouched against <b>the</b> cliff, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> air cleared again they saw that <b>the</b> path <b>was</b> blocked behind them.
<br>   “Enough, enough!” cried Gimli. “We are departing as quickly as we may!” And indeed with that last stroke <b>the</b> malice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain seemed <b>to</b> be expended, as if Caradhras <b>was</b> satisfied that <b>the</b> invaders <b>had</b> been beaten off <b>and</b> would not dare <b>to</b> return. The threat <b>of</b> snow lifted; <b>the</b> clouds began <b>to</b> break <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light grew broader.
<br>   As Legolas <b>had</b> reported, they found that <b>the</b> snow became steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even <b>the</b> hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood <b>once</b> more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flat shelf at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steep slope where they <b>had</b> felt <b>the</b> first flakes <b>of</b> snow <b>the</b> night before.
<br>   The morning <b>was</b> now far advanced. From <b>the</b> high place they looked back westwards over <b>the</b> lower lands. Far away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tumble <b>of</b> country that lay at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain <b>was</b> <b>the</b> dell from which they <b>had</b> started <b>to</b> climb <b>the</b> pass.
<br>   Frodo's legs ached. He <b>was</b> chilled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bone <b>and</b> hungry; <b>and</b> his head <b>was</b> dizzy as he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long <b>and</b> painful march downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> black specks remained. In <b>the</b> distance below him, <b>but</b> still high above <b>the</b> lower foothills, dark dots were circling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air.
<br>   “The birds again!” said Aragorn, pointing down.
<br>   “That cannot be helped now,” said Gandalf. “Whether they are good <b>or</b> evil, <b>or</b> have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us at all, we must go down at <b>once</b>. Not even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> knees <b>of</b> Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!”
<br>   A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, <b>and</b> stumbled wearily down <b>the</b> slope. Caradhras <b>had</b> defeated them.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 4
<br>A JOURNEY IN <b>THE</b> DARK
<br>
<br>   It <b>was</b> evening, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey light <b>was</b> again waning fast, when they halted for <b>the</b> night. They were <b>very</b> weary. The mountains were veiled <b>in</b> deepening dusk, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>was</b> cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miruvor <b>of</b> Rivendell. When they <b>had</b> eaten some food he called a council.
<br>   “We cannot, <b>of</b> course, go <b>on</b> again tonight,” he said. “The attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate has <b>tired</b> us out, <b>and</b> we must rest here for a while.”
<br>   “And then where are we <b>to</b> go? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “We still have our journey <b>and</b> our errand before us,” answered Gandalf. “We have <b>no</b> choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> Rivendell.”
<br>   Pippin's face brightened visibly at <b>the</b> mere mention <b>of</b> return <b>to</b> Rivendell; Merry <b>and</b> Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir made <b>no</b> sign. Frodo looked troubled.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> back there,” he said. “But how can <b>I</b> return <b>without</b> shame—unless there <b>is</b> indeed <b>no</b> other way, <b>and</b> we are already defeated?”
<br>   “You are right, Frodo,” said Gandalf: “<b>to</b> go back <b>is</b> <b>to</b> admit defeat <b>and</b> face worse defeat <b>to</b> come. If we go back now, then <b>the</b> Ring must remain there: we shall not be able <b>to</b> set out again. Then sooner <b>or</b> later Rivendell will be besieged, <b>and</b> after a brief <b>and</b> bitter time <b>it</b> will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, <b>but</b> they are only shadows yet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> terror they would possess if <b>the</b> Ruling Ring <b>was</b> <b>on</b> their master's hand again.”
<br>   “Then we must go <b>on</b>, if there <b>is</b> a way,” said Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back <b>into</b> gloom.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> a way that we may attempt,” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>, when first <b>I</b> considered this journey, that we should try <b>it</b>. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not a pleasant way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have not spoken <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company before. Aragorn <b>was</b> against <b>it</b>, until <b>the</b> pass over <b>the</b> mountains <b>had</b> at least been tried.”
<br>   “If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a worse road than <b>the</b> Redhorn Gate, then <b>it</b> must be evil indeed,” said Merry. “But you <b>had</b> better tell us about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> let us know <b>the</b> worst at <b>once</b>.”
<br>   “The road that <b>I</b> speak <b>of</b> leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mines <b>of</b> Moria,” said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes. On all <b>the</b> others a dread fell at <b>the</b> mention <b>of</b> that name. Even <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a legend <b>of</b> vague fear:
<br>   “The road may lead <b>to</b> Moria, <b>but</b> how can we hope that <b>it</b> will lead through Moria? “said Aragorn darkly.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> a name <b>of</b> ill omen,” said Boromir. “Nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> see <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> go there. If we cannot cross <b>the</b> mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gap <b>of</b> Rohan, where men are friendly <b>to</b> my people, taking <b>the</b> road that <b>I</b> followed <b>on</b> my way hither. Or we might pass <b>by</b> <b>and</b> cross <b>the</b> Isen <b>into</b> Langstrand <b>and</b> Lebennin, <b>and</b> so come <b>to</b> Gondor from <b>the</b> regions nigh <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea.”
<br>   “Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,” answered Gandalf. “Did you not hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> told you <b>of</b> Saruman? With him <b>I</b> may have business <b>of</b> my own ere all <b>is</b> over. But <b>the</b> Ring must not come near Isengard, if that can <b>by</b> any means be prevented. The Gap <b>of</b> Rohan <b>is</b> closed <b>to</b> us while we go with <b>the</b> Bearer.
<br>   “As for <b>the</b> longer road: we cannot afford <b>the</b> time. We might spend a year <b>in</b> such a journey, <b>and</b> we should pass through many lands that are empty <b>and</b> harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both <b>of</b> Saruman <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy are <b>on</b> them. When you came north, Boromir, you were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from <b>the</b> South <b>and</b> a matter <b>of</b> small concern <b>to</b> him: his mind <b>was</b> busy with <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring. But you return now as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring's Company, <b>and</b> you are <b>in</b> peril as long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that we go south under <b>the</b> naked sky.
<br>   “Since our open attempt <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, <b>I</b> fear. <b>I</b> see now little hope, if we <b>do</b> not soon vanish from sight for a while, <b>and</b> cover our trail. Therefore <b>I</b> advise that we should go neither over <b>the</b> mountains, nor round them, <b>but</b> under them. That <b>is</b> a road at any rate that <b>the</b> Enemy will least expect us <b>to</b> take.”
<br>   “We <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> he expects,” said Boromir. “He may watch all roads, likely <b>and</b> unlikely. In that case <b>to</b> enter Moria would be <b>to</b> walk <b>into</b> a trap, hardly better than knocking at <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower itself. The name <b>of</b> Moria <b>is</b> black.”
<br>   “You speak <b>of</b> <b>what</b> you <b>do</b> not know, when you liken Moria <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stronghold <b>of</b> Sauron,” answered Gandalf. “<b>I</b> alone <b>of</b> you have ever been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dungeons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, <b>and</b> only <b>in</b> his older <b>and</b> lesser dwelling <b>in</b> Dol Guldur. Those who pass <b>the</b> gates <b>of</b> Barad-d?r <b>do</b> not return. But <b>I</b> would not lead you <b>into</b> Moria if there were <b>no</b> hope <b>of</b> coming out again. If there are Orcs there, <b>it</b> may prove ill for us, that <b>is</b> true. But most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains were scattered <b>or</b> destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> a hope that Moria <b>is</b> still free.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> even a chance that Dwarves are there, <b>and</b> that <b>in</b> some deep hall <b>of</b> his fathers, Balin son <b>of</b> Fundin may be found. However <b>it</b> may prove, one must tread <b>the</b> path that need chooses!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will tread <b>the</b> path with you, Gandalf! “said Gimli. “<b>I</b> will go <b>and</b> look <b>on</b> <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find <b>the</b> doors that are shut.”
<br>   “Good, Gimli! “said Gandalf. “You encourage me. We will seek <b>the</b> hidden doors together. And we will come through. In <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves, a dwarf's head will be less easy <b>to</b> bewilder than Elves <b>or</b> Men <b>or</b> Hobbits. Yet <b>it</b> will not be <b>the</b> first time that <b>I</b> have been <b>to</b> Moria. <b>I</b> sought there long for Thr?<b>in</b> son <b>of</b> Thr?r after he <b>was</b> lost. <b>I</b> passed through, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> came out again alive!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> too <b>once</b> passed <b>the</b> Dimrill Gate,” said Aragorn quietly; “<b>but</b> though <b>I</b> also came out again, <b>the</b> memory <b>is</b> <b>very</b> evil. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> enter Moria a second time.”
<br>   “And <b>I</b> don't wish <b>to</b> enter <b>it</b> even <b>once</b>,” said Pippin.
<br>   “Nor me,” muttered Sam.
<br>   “Of course not! “said Gandalf. “Who would? But <b>the</b> question <b>is</b>: who will follow me, if <b>I</b> lead you there?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will,” said Gimli eagerly.
<br>   “<b>I</b> will,” said Aragorn heavily. “You followed my lead almost <b>to</b> disaster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> snow, <b>and</b> have said <b>no</b> word <b>of</b> blame. <b>I</b> will follow your lead now—if this last warning does not move you. It <b>is</b> not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring, nor <b>of</b> us others that <b>I</b> am thinking now, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> you, Gandalf. And <b>I</b> say <b>to</b> you: if you pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Moria, beware!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will not go,” said Boromir; “not unless <b>the</b> vote <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole company <b>is</b> against me. What <b>do</b> Legolas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little folk say? The Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> Moria,” said Legolas.
<br>   The hobbits said <b>nothing</b>. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> go,” he said; “<b>but</b> neither <b>do</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> refuse <b>the</b> advice <b>of</b> Gandalf. <b>I</b> beg that there should be <b>no</b> vote, until we have slept <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Gandalf will <b>get</b> votes easier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning than <b>in</b> this cold gloom. How <b>the</b> wind howls!”
<br>   At these words all fell <b>into</b> silent <b>thought</b>. They heard <b>the</b> wind hissing among <b>the</b> rocks <b>and</b> trees, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a howling <b>and</b> wailing round them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> empty spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   Suddenly Aragorn leapt <b>to</b> his feet. “How <b>the</b> wind howls! “he cried. “It <b>is</b> howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mountains!”
<br>   “Need we wait until morning then? “said Gandalf. “It <b>is</b> as <b>I</b> said. The hunt <b>is</b> up! Even if we live <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> dawn, who now will wish <b>to</b> journey south <b>by</b> night with <b>the</b> wild wolves <b>on</b> his trail?”
<br>   “How far <b>is</b> Moria? “asked Boromir.
<br>   “There <b>was</b> a door south-west <b>of</b> Caradhras, some fifteen miles as <b>the</b> crow flies, <b>and</b> maybe twenty as <b>the</b> wolf runs,” answered Gandalf grimly.
<br>   “Then let us start as soon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> light tomorrow, if we can,” said Boromir. “The wolf that one hears <b>is</b> worse than <b>the</b> orc that one fears.”
<br>   “True!” said Aragorn, loosening his sword <b>in</b> its sheath. “But where <b>the</b> warg howls, there also <b>the</b> orc prowls.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken Elrond's advice,” muttered Pippin <b>to</b> Sam. “<b>I</b> am <b>no</b> good after all. There <b>is</b> not enough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed <b>of</b> Bandobras <b>the</b> Bullroarer <b>in</b> me: these howls freeze my blood. <b>I</b> don't ever remember feeling so wretched.”
<br>   “My heart's right down <b>in</b> my toes, Mr. Pippin,” said Sam. “But we aren't etten yet, <b>and</b> there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may be <b>in</b> store for old Gandalf, <b>I</b>'ll wager <b>it</b> isn't a wolf's belly.”
<br>   For their defence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night <b>the</b> Company climbed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small hill under which they <b>had</b> been sheltering. <b>it</b> <b>was</b> crowned with a knot <b>of</b> old <b>and</b> twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle <b>of</b> boulder stones. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> this they lit a fire, for there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> hope that darkness <b>and</b> silence would keep their trail from discovery <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hunting packs.
<br>   Round <b>the</b> fire they sat, <b>and</b> those that were not <b>on</b> guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill <b>the</b> pony trembled <b>and</b> sweated where he stood. The howling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves <b>was</b> now all round them, sometimes nearer <b>and</b> sometimes further off. In <b>the</b> dead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night many shining eyes were seen peering over <b>the</b> brow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. Some advanced almost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> stones. At a gap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning his pack <b>to</b> <b>the</b> assault.
<br>   Gandalf stood up <b>and</b> strode forward, holding his staff aloft. “Listen, Hound <b>of</b> Sauron! “he cried. “Gandalf <b>is</b> here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! <b>I</b> will shrivel you from tail <b>to</b> snout, if you come within this ring.”
<br>   The wolf snarled <b>and</b> sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there <b>was</b> a sharp twang. Legolas <b>had</b> loosed his bow. There <b>was</b> a hideous yell, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leaping shape thudded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground; <b>the</b> elvish arrow <b>had</b> pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished. Gandalf <b>and</b> Aragorn strode forward, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>was</b> deserted; <b>the</b> hunting packs <b>had</b> fled. All about them <b>the</b> darkness grew silent, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> cry came <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sighing wind.
<br>   The night <b>was</b> old, <b>and</b> westward <b>the</b> waning moon <b>was</b> setting. gleaming fitfully through <b>the</b> breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep. Without warning a storm <b>of</b> howls broke out fierce <b>and</b> wild all about <b>the</b> camp. A great host <b>of</b> Wargs <b>had</b> gathered silently <b>and</b> <b>was</b> now attacking them from every side at <b>once</b>.
<br>   “Fling fuel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire!” cried Gandalf <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. “Draw your blades, <b>and</b> stand back <b>to</b> back!”
<br>   In <b>the</b> leaping light, as <b>the</b> fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over <b>the</b> ring <b>of</b> stones. More <b>and</b> more followed. Through <b>the</b> throat <b>of</b> one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed <b>the</b> head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow <b>of</b> Legolas <b>was</b> singing.
<br>   In <b>the</b> wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly <b>to</b> grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like <b>the</b> monument <b>of</b> some ancient king <b>of</b> stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch <b>and</b> strode <b>to</b> meet <b>the</b> wolves. They gave back before him. High <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air he tossed <b>the</b> blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; <b>and</b> his voice rolled like thunder.
<br>   “Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!” he cried.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a roar <b>and</b> a crackle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tree above him burst <b>into</b> a leaf <b>and</b> bloom <b>of</b> blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top <b>to</b> tree-top. The whole hill <b>was</b> crowned with dazzling light. The swords <b>and</b> knives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders shone <b>and</b> flickered. The last arrow <b>of</b> Legolas kindled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air as <b>it</b> flew, <b>and</b> plunged burning <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> a great wolf-chieftain. All <b>the</b> others fled.
<br>   Slowly <b>the</b> fire died till <b>nothing</b> <b>was</b> left <b>but</b> falling ash <b>and</b> sparks; a bitter smoke curled above <b>the</b> burned tree-stumps, <b>and</b> blew darkly from <b>the</b> hill, as <b>the</b> first light <b>of</b> dawn came dimly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. Their enemies were routed <b>and</b> did not return.
<br>   “What did <b>I</b> tell you, Mr. Pippin? “said Sam, sheIthing his sword. “Wolves won't <b>get</b> him. That <b>was</b> an eye-opener, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> mistake! Nearly singed <b>the</b> hair off my head!”
<br>   When <b>the</b> full light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning came <b>no</b> signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves were <b>to</b> be found, <b>and</b> they looked <b>in</b> vain for <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead. No trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight remained <b>but</b> <b>the</b> charred trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrows <b>of</b> Legolas lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-top. All were undamaged save one <b>of</b> which only <b>the</b> point <b>was</b> left.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> as <b>I</b> feared,” said Gandalf. “These were <b>no</b> ordinary wolves hunting for food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. Let us eat quickly <b>and</b> go!”
<br>   That day <b>the</b> weather changed again, almost as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> some power that <b>had</b> <b>no</b> longer any <b>use</b> for snow, since they <b>had</b> retreated from <b>the</b> pass, a power that wished now <b>to</b> have a clear light <b>in</b> which things that moved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild could be seen from far away. The wind <b>had</b> been turning through north <b>to</b> north-west during <b>the</b> night, <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> failed. The clouds vanished southwards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> opened, high <b>and</b> blue. As they stood upon <b>the</b> hill-side, ready <b>to</b> depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over <b>the</b> mountain-tops.
<br>   “We must reach <b>the</b> doors before sunset,” said Gandalf, “<b>or</b> <b>I</b> fear we shall not reach them at all. It <b>is</b> not far, <b>but</b> our path may be winding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked <b>in</b> this country, <b>and</b> only <b>once</b> have <b>I</b> been under <b>the</b> west wall <b>of</b> Moria, <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> long ago.
<br>   “There <b>it</b> lies,” he said, pointing away south-eastwards <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> mountains” sides fell sheer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadows at their feet. In <b>the</b> distance could be dimly seen a line <b>of</b> bare cliffs, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> their midst, taller than <b>the</b> rest, one great grey wall. “When we left <b>the</b> pass <b>I</b> led you southwards, <b>and</b> not back <b>to</b> our starting point, as some <b>of</b> you may have noticed. It <b>is</b> well that <b>I</b> did so, for now we have several miles less <b>to</b> cross, <b>and</b> haste <b>is</b> needed. Let us go!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know which <b>to</b> hope,” said Boromir grimly: “that Gandalf will find <b>what</b> he seeks, <b>or</b> that coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cliff we shall find <b>the</b> gates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be caught between wolves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>the</b> likeliest chance. Lead <b>on</b>!”
<br>   Gimli now walked ahead <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wizard's side, so eager <b>was</b> he <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> Moria. Together they led <b>the</b> Company back towards <b>the</b> mountains. The only road <b>of</b> old <b>to</b> Moria from <b>the</b> west <b>had</b> lain along <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> a stream, <b>the</b> Sirannon, that ran out from <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliffs near where <b>the</b> doors <b>had</b> stood. But either Gandalf <b>was</b> astray, <b>or</b> else <b>the</b> land <b>had</b> changed <b>in</b> recent years; for he did not strike <b>the</b> stream where he looked <b>to</b> find <b>it</b>, only a few miles southwards from their start.
<br>   The morning <b>was</b> passing towards noon, <b>and</b> still <b>the</b> Company wandered <b>and</b> scrambled <b>in</b> a barren country <b>of</b> red stones. Nowhere could they see any gleam <b>of</b> water <b>or</b> hear any sound <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. All <b>was</b> bleak <b>and</b> dry. Their hearts sank. They saw <b>no</b> living thing, <b>and</b> not a bird <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky; <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> night would bring, if <b>it</b> caught them <b>in</b> that lost land, none <b>of</b> them cared <b>to</b> think.
<br>   Suddenly Gimli, who <b>had</b> pressed <b>on</b> ahead, called back <b>to</b> them. He <b>was</b> standing <b>on</b> a knoll <b>and</b> pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Hurrying up they saw below them a deep <b>and</b> narrow channel. It <b>was</b> empty <b>and</b> silent, <b>and</b> hardly a trickle <b>of</b> water flowed among <b>the</b> brown <b>and</b> red-stained stones <b>of</b> its bed; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> near side there <b>was</b> a path, much broken <b>and</b> decayed, that wound its way among <b>the</b> ruined walls <b>and</b> paving-stones <b>of</b> an ancient highroad.
<br>   “Ah! Here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at last! “said Gandalf. “This <b>is</b> where <b>the</b> stream ran: Sirannon, <b>the</b> Gate-stream, they used <b>to</b> call <b>it</b>. But <b>what</b> has happened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>I</b> cannot guess; <b>it</b> used <b>to</b> be swift <b>and</b> noisy. Come! We must hurry <b>on</b>. We are late.”
<br>   The Company were footsore <b>and</b> <b>tired</b>; <b>but</b> they trudged doggedly along <b>the</b> rough <b>and</b> winding track for many miles. The sun turned from <b>the</b> noon <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> go west. After a brief halt <b>and</b> a hasty meal they went <b>on</b> again. Before them <b>the</b> mountains frowned, <b>but</b> their path lay <b>in</b> a deep trough <b>of</b> land <b>and</b> they could see only <b>the</b> higher shoulders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> far eastward peaks.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> a sharp bend. There <b>the</b> road, which <b>had</b> been veering southwards between <b>the</b> brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>and</b> a steep fall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, turned <b>and</b> went due east again. Rounding <b>the</b> corner they saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken <b>and</b> jagged top. Over <b>it</b> a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed <b>to</b> have been carved out <b>by</b> a fall that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been strong <b>and</b> full.
<br>   “Indeed things have changed! “said Gandalf. “But there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> mistaking <b>the</b> place. There <b>is</b> all that remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stair Falls. If <b>I</b> remember right, there <b>was</b> a flight <b>of</b> steps cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rock at their side, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> main road wound away left <b>and</b> climbed with several loops up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level ground at <b>the</b> top. There used <b>to</b> be a shallow valley beyond <b>the</b> falls right up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Walls <b>of</b> Moria, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sirannon flowed through <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> road beside <b>it</b>. Let us go <b>and</b> see <b>what</b> things are like now!”
<br>   They found <b>the</b> stone steps <b>without</b> difficulty, <b>and</b> Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed <b>by</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Frodo. When they reached <b>the</b> top they saw that they could go <b>no</b> further that way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reason for <b>the</b> drying up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gate-stream <b>was</b> revealed. Behind them <b>the</b> sinking Sun filled <b>the</b> cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset <b>was</b> reflected <b>on</b> its sullen surface. The Sirannon <b>had</b> been dammed <b>and</b> <b>had</b> filled all <b>the</b> valley. Beyond <b>the</b> ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fading light: final <b>and</b> impassable. No sign <b>of</b> gate <b>or</b> entrance, not a fissure <b>or</b> crack could Frodo see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frowning stone.
<br>   “There are <b>the</b> Walls <b>of</b> Moria,” said Gandalf, pointing across <b>the</b> water. “And there <b>the</b> Gate stood <b>once</b> upon a time, <b>the</b> Elven Door at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road from Hollin <b>by</b> which we have come. But this way <b>is</b> blocked. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>I</b> guess, will wish <b>to</b> swim this gloomy water at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. It has an unwholesome look.”
<br>   “We must find a way round <b>the</b> northern edge,” said Gimli. “The first thing for <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> climb up <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main path <b>and</b> see where that will lead us. Even if there were <b>no</b> lake, we could not <b>get</b> our baggage-pony up this stair.”
<br>   “But <b>in</b> any case we cannot take <b>the</b> poor beast <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mines,” said Gandalf. “The road under <b>the</b> mountains <b>is</b> a dark road, <b>and</b> there are places narrow <b>and</b> steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.”
<br>   “Poor old Bill! “said Frodo. “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that. And poor Sam! <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> he will say?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sorry,” said Gandalf. “Poor Bill has been a useful companion <b>and</b> <b>it</b> goes <b>to</b> my heart <b>to</b> turn him adrift now. <b>I</b> would have travelled lighter <b>and</b> brought <b>no</b> animal, least <b>of</b> all this one that Sam <b>is</b> fond <b>of</b>, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> my way. <b>I</b> feared all along that we should be obliged <b>to</b> take this road.”
<br>   The day <b>was</b> drawing <b>to</b> its end, <b>and</b> cold stars were glinting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky high above <b>the</b> sunset, when <b>the</b> Company, with all <b>the</b> speed they could, climbed up <b>the</b> slopes <b>and</b> reached <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. In breadth <b>it</b> looked <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> more than two <b>or</b> three furlongs at <b>the</b> widest point. How far <b>it</b> stretched away southward they could not see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> failing light; <b>but</b> its northern end <b>was</b> <b>no</b> more than half a mile from where they stood, <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> stony ridges that enclosed <b>the</b> valley <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water's edge there <b>was</b> a rim <b>of</b> open ground. They hurried forward, for they <b>had</b> still a mile <b>or</b> two <b>to</b> go before they could reach <b>the</b> point <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far shore that Gandalf <b>was</b> making for; <b>and</b> then he <b>had</b> still <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> doors.
<br>   When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northernmost corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way. It <b>was</b> green <b>and</b> stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards <b>the</b> enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, <b>and</b> found that <b>the</b> water <b>was</b> shallow, <b>no</b> more than ankle-deep at <b>the</b> edge. Behind him they walked <b>in</b> file, threading their way with care, for under <b>the</b> weedy pools were sliding <b>and</b> greasy stones, <b>and</b> footing <b>was</b> treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at <b>the</b> touch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark unclean water <b>on</b> his feet.
<br>   As Sam, <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, led Bill up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dry ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed <b>by</b> a plop, as if a fish <b>had</b> disturbed <b>the</b> still surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake. There <b>was</b> a bubbling noise, <b>and</b> then silence. The dusk deepened, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last gleams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunset were veiled <b>in</b> cloud.
<br>   Gandalf now pressed <b>on</b> at a great pace, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others followed as quickly as they could. They reached <b>the</b> strip <b>of</b> dry land between <b>the</b> lake <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cliffs: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, <b>and</b> encumbered with fallen rock <b>and</b> stones; <b>but</b> they found a way, hugging <b>the</b> cliff, <b>and</b> keeping as far from <b>the</b> dark water as they might. A mile southwards along <b>the</b> shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps <b>and</b> dead boughs were rotting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallows, <b>the</b> remains <b>it</b> seemed <b>of</b> old thickets, <b>or</b> <b>of</b> a hedge that <b>had</b> <b>once</b> lined <b>the</b> road across <b>the</b> drowned valley. But close under <b>the</b> cliff there stood, still strong <b>and</b> living, . two tall trees, larger than any trees <b>of</b> holly that Frodo <b>had</b> ever seen <b>or</b> imagined. Their great roots spread from <b>the</b> wall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water. Under <b>the</b> looming cliffs they <b>had</b> looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stair; <b>but</b> now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, <b>and</b> silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>   “Well, here we are at last! “said Gandalf. “Here <b>the</b> Elven-way from Hollin ended. Holly <b>was</b> <b>the</b> token <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> that land, <b>and</b> they planted <b>it</b> here <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> their domain; for <b>the</b> West-door <b>was</b> made chiefly for their <b>use</b> <b>in</b> their traffic with <b>the</b> Lords <b>of</b> Moria. Those were happier days, when there <b>was</b> still close friendship at times between folk <b>of</b> different race, even between Dwarves <b>and</b> Elves.”
<br>   “It <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> fault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves that <b>the</b> friendship waned,” said Gimli.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have not heard that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves,” said Legolas.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have heard both,” said Gandalf; “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> will not give judgement now. But <b>I</b> beg you two, Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli, at least <b>to</b> be friends, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> help me. <b>I</b> need you both. The doors are shut <b>and</b> hidden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sooner we find them <b>the</b> better. Night <b>is</b> at hand!”
<br>   Turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others he said: “While <b>I</b> am searching, will you each make ready <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> Mines? For here <b>I</b> fear we must say farewell <b>to</b> our good beast <b>of</b> burden. You must lay aside much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you will not need <b>it</b> inside, nor, <b>I</b> hope, when we come through <b>and</b> journey <b>on</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> South. Instead each <b>of</b> us must take a share <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> pony carried, especially <b>the</b> food <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water-skins.”
<br>   “But you can't leave poor old Bill behind <b>in</b> this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf! “cried Sam, angry <b>and</b> distressed. “<b>I</b> won't have <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> that's flat. After he has come so far <b>and</b> all!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sorry, Sam,” said <b>the</b> wizard. “But when <b>the</b> Door opens <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think you will be able <b>to</b> drag your Bill inside, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> long dark <b>of</b> Moria. You will have <b>to</b> choose between Bill <b>and</b> your master.”
<br>   “He'd follow Mr. Frodo <b>into</b> a dragon's den, if <b>I</b> led him,” protested Sam. “It'd be <b>nothing</b> short <b>of</b> murder <b>to</b> turn him loose with all these wolves about.”
<br>   “It will be short <b>of</b> murder, <b>I</b> hope,” said Gandalf. He laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pony's head, <b>and</b> spoke <b>in</b> a low voice. “Go with words <b>of</b> guard <b>and</b> guiding <b>on</b> you,” he said. “You are a wise beast, <b>and</b> have learned much <b>in</b> Rivendell. Make your ways <b>to</b> places where you can find grass, <b>and</b> so come <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> Elrond's house, <b>or</b> wherever you wish <b>to</b> go.
<br>   “There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance <b>of</b> escaping wolves <b>and</b> getting home as we have.”
<br>   Sam stood sullenly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pony <b>and</b> returned <b>no</b> answer. Bill, seeming <b>to</b> understand well <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going <b>on</b>, nuzzled up <b>to</b> him, putting his nose <b>to</b> Sam's ear. Sam burst <b>into</b> tears, <b>and</b> fumbled with <b>the</b> straps, unlading all <b>the</b> pony's packs <b>and</b> throwing them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. The others sorted out <b>the</b> goods, making a pile <b>of</b> all that could be left behind, <b>and</b> dividing up <b>the</b> rest.
<br>   When this <b>was</b> done they turned <b>to</b> watch Gandalf. He appeared <b>to</b> have done <b>nothing</b>. He <b>was</b> standing between <b>the</b> two trees gazing at <b>the</b> blank wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, as if he would bore a hole <b>into</b> <b>it</b> with his eyes. Gimli <b>was</b> wandering about, tapping <b>the</b> stone here <b>and</b> there with his axe. Legolas <b>was</b> pressed against <b>the</b> rock, as if listening.
<br>   “Well, here we are <b>and</b> all ready,” said Merry; “<b>but</b> where are <b>the</b> Doors? <b>I</b> can't see any sign <b>of</b> them.”
<br>   “Dwarf-doors are not made <b>to</b> be seen when shut,” said Gimli. “They are invisible, <b>and</b> their own masters cannot find them <b>or</b> open them, if their secret <b>is</b> forgotten.”
<br>   “But this Door <b>was</b> not made <b>to</b> be a secret known only <b>to</b> Dwarves,” said Gandalf, coming suddenly <b>to</b> life <b>and</b> turning round. “Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> look for may discover <b>the</b> signs.”
<br>   He walked forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. Right between <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees there <b>was</b> a smooth space, <b>and</b> over this he passed his hands <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.
<br>   “Look!” he said. “Can you see anything now?”
<br>   The Moon now shone upon <b>the</b> grey face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock; <b>but</b> they could see <b>nothing</b> else for a while. Then slowly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface, where <b>the</b> wizard's hands <b>had</b> passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins <b>of</b> silver running <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stone. At first they were <b>no</b> more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where <b>the</b> Moon caught them, <b>but</b> steadily they grew broader <b>and</b> clearer, until their design could be guessed.
<br>   
<br>   At <b>the</b> top, as high as Gandalf could reach, <b>was</b> an arch <b>of</b> interlacing letters <b>in</b> an Elvish character. Below, though <b>the</b> threads were <b>in</b> places blurred <b>or</b> broken, <b>the</b> outline could be seen <b>of</b> an anvil <b>and</b> a hammer surmounted <b>by</b> a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door a single star with many rays.
<br>   “There are <b>the</b> emblems <b>of</b> Durin!” cried Gimli.
<br>   “And there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Tree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Elves!” said Legolas.
<br>   “And <b>the</b> Star <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> F?anor,” said Gandalf. “They are wrought <b>of</b> ithildin that mirrors only starlight <b>and</b> moonlight, <b>and</b> sleeps until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> touched <b>by</b> one who speaks words now long forgotten <b>in</b> Middle-earth. It <b>is</b> long since <b>I</b> heard them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> deeply before <b>I</b> could recall them <b>to</b> my mind.”
<br>   “What does <b>the</b> writing say?” asked Frodo, who <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> decipher <b>the</b> inscription <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arch. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> knew <b>the</b> elf-letters <b>but</b> <b>I</b> cannot read these.”
<br>   “The words are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elven-tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> Middle-earth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days,” answered Gandalf. “But they <b>do</b> not say anything <b>of</b> importance <b>to</b> us. They say only: The Doors <b>of</b> Durin, Lord <b>of</b> Moria. Speak, friend, <b>and</b> enter. And underneath small <b>and</b> faint <b>is</b> written: <b>I</b>, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor <b>of</b> Hollin drew these signs.”
<br>   “What does <b>it</b> mean <b>by</b> speak, friend, <b>and</b> enter?” asked Merry.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> plain enough,” said Gimli. “If you are a friend, speak <b>the</b> password, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors will open, <b>and</b> you can enter.”
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf, “these doors are probably governed <b>by</b> words. Some dwarf-gates will open only at special times, <b>or</b> for particular persons; <b>and</b> some have locks <b>and</b> keys that are still needed when all necessary times <b>and</b> words are known. These doors have <b>no</b> key. In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open <b>and</b> doorwards sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew <b>the</b> opening word could speak <b>it</b> <b>and</b> pass <b>in</b>. At least so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> recorded, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not, Gimli?”
<br>   “It <b>is</b>,” said <b>the</b> dwarf. “But <b>what</b> <b>the</b> word <b>was</b> <b>is</b> not remembered. Narvi <b>and</b> his craft <b>and</b> all his kindred have vanished from <b>the</b> earth.”
<br>   “But <b>do</b> not you know <b>the</b> word, Gandalf? “asked Boromir <b>in</b> surprise.
<br>   “No! “said <b>the</b> wizard.
<br>   The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent <b>and</b> unmoved.
<br>   “Then <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> bringing us <b>to</b> this accursed spot?” cried Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at <b>the</b> dark water. “You told us that you <b>had</b> <b>once</b> passed through <b>the</b> Mines. How could that be, if you did not know how <b>to</b> enter?”
<br>   “The answer <b>to</b> your first question, Boromir,” said <b>the</b> wizard, “<b>is</b> that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>the</b> word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,” he added, with a glint <b>in</b> his eyes under their bristling brows, “you may ask <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: <b>do</b> you doubt my tale? Or have you <b>no</b> wits left? <b>I</b> did not enter this way. <b>I</b> came from <b>the</b> East.
<br>   “If you wish <b>to</b> know, <b>I</b> will tell you that these doors open outwards. From <b>the</b> inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From <b>the</b> outside <b>nothing</b> will move them save <b>the</b> spell <b>of</b> command. They cannot be forced inwards.”
<br>   “What are you going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> then? “asked Pippin, undaunted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wizard's bristling brows.
<br>   “Knock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors with your head, Peregrin Took,” said Gandalf. “But if that does not shatter them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, <b>I</b> will seek for <b>the</b> opening words.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>once</b> knew every spell <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> tongues <b>of</b> Elves <b>or</b> Men <b>or</b> Orcs that <b>was</b> ever used for such a purpose. <b>I</b> can still remember ten score <b>of</b> them <b>without</b> searching <b>in</b> my mind. But only a few trials, <b>I</b> think, will be needed; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall not have <b>to</b> call <b>on</b> Gimli for words <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret dwarf-tongue that they teach <b>to</b> none. The opening words were Elvish, like <b>the</b> writing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arch: that seems certain.”
<br>   He stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock again, <b>and</b> lightly touched with his staff <b>the</b> silver star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle beneath <b>the</b> sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anvil.
<br>   
<br>Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!
<br>Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!
<br>   
<br>   he said <b>in</b> a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> blank grey stone did not stir.
<br>   Many times he repeated these words <b>in</b> different order, <b>or</b> varied them. Then he tried other spells. one after another, speaking now faster <b>and</b> louder, now soft <b>and</b> slow. Then he spoke many single words <b>of</b> Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night, <b>the</b> countless stars were kindled, <b>the</b> wind blew cold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors stood fast.
<br>   Again Gandalf approached <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> lifting up his arms he spoke <b>in</b> tones <b>of</b> command <b>and</b> rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, <b>and</b> struck <b>the</b> rock with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b> with <b>the</b> same command <b>in</b> every language that <b>had</b> ever been spoken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West <b>of</b> Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>and</b> sat down <b>in</b> silence.
<br>   At that moment from far off <b>the</b> wind bore <b>to</b> their listening ears <b>the</b> howling <b>of</b> wolves. Bill <b>the</b> pony started <b>in</b> fear, <b>and</b> Sam sprang <b>to</b> his side <b>and</b> whispered softly <b>to</b> him.
<br>   “Do not let him run away! “said Boromir. “It seems that we shall need him still, if <b>the</b> wolves <b>do</b> not find us. How <b>I</b> hate this foul pool! “He stooped <b>and</b> picking up a large stone he cast <b>it</b> far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark water.
<br>   The stone vanished with a soft slap; <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> same instant there <b>was</b> a swish <b>and</b> a bubble. Great rippling rings formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface out beyond where <b>the</b> stone <b>had</b> fallen, <b>and</b> they moved slowly towards <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff.
<br>   “Why did you <b>do</b> that, Boromir? “said Frodo. “<b>I</b> hate this place, too, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am afraid. <b>I</b> don't know <b>of</b> <b>what</b>: not <b>of</b> wolves, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> dark behind <b>the</b> doors, <b>but</b> <b>of</b> something else. <b>I</b> am afraid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pool. Don't disturb <b>it</b>!”
<br>   “l wish we could <b>get</b> away! “said Merry.
<br>   “Why doesn't Gandalf <b>do</b> something quick? “said Pippin.
<br>   Gandalf took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> them. He sat with his head bowed, either <b>in</b> despair <b>or</b> <b>in</b> anxious <b>thought</b>. The mournful howling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolves <b>was</b> heard again. The ripples <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water grew <b>and</b> came closer; some were already lapping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore.
<br>   With a suddenness that startled them all <b>the</b> wizard sprang <b>to</b> his feet. He <b>was</b> laughing! “<b>I</b> have <b>it</b>! “he cried. “Of course, <b>of</b> course! Absurdly simple, like most riddles when you see <b>the</b> answer.”
<br>   Picking up his staff he stood before <b>the</b> rock <b>and</b> said <b>in</b> a clear voice: Mellon!
<br>   The star shone out briefly <b>and</b> faded again. Then silently a great doorway <b>was</b> outlined, though not a crack <b>or</b> joint <b>had</b> been visible before. Slowly <b>it</b> divided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>and</b> swung outwards inch <b>by</b> inch, until both doors lay back against <b>the</b> wall. Through <b>the</b> opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; <b>but</b> beyond <b>the</b> lower steps <b>the</b> darkness <b>was</b> deeper than <b>the</b> night. The Company stared <b>in</b> wonder.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> wrong after all,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> Gimli too. Merry, <b>of</b> all people, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right track. The opening word <b>was</b> inscribed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> archway all <b>the</b> time! The translation should have been: Say “Friend” <b>and</b> enter. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> speak <b>the</b> Elvish word for friend <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master <b>in</b> these suspicious days. Those were happier times. Now let us go!”
<br>   He strode forward <b>and</b> set his foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lowest step. But at that moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ankle, <b>and</b> he fell with a cry. Bill <b>the</b> pony gave a wild neigh <b>of</b> fear, <b>and</b> turned tail <b>and</b> dashed away along <b>the</b> lakeside <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Sam leaped after him, <b>and</b> then hearing Frodo's cry he ran back again, weeping <b>and</b> cursing. The others swung round <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake seething, as if a host <b>of</b> snakes were swimming up from <b>the</b> southern end.
<br>   Out from <b>the</b> water a long sinuous tentacle <b>had</b> crawled; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pale-green <b>and</b> luminous <b>and</b> wet. Its fingered end <b>had</b> hold <b>of</b> Frodo's foot <b>and</b> <b>was</b> dragging him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. Sam <b>on</b> his knees <b>was</b> now slashing at <b>it</b> with a knife.
<br>   The arm let go <b>of</b> Frodo, <b>and</b> Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a hideous stench.
<br>   “Into <b>the</b> gateway! Up <b>the</b> stairs! Quick! “shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from <b>the</b> horror that seemed <b>to</b> have rooted all <b>but</b> Sam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground where they stood, he drove them forward.
<br>   They were just <b>in</b> time. Sam <b>and</b> Frodo were only a few steps up, <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>had</b> just begun <b>to</b> climb, when <b>the</b> groping tentacles writhed across <b>the</b> narrow shore <b>and</b> fingered <b>the</b> cliff-wall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> doors. One came wriggling over <b>the</b> threshold, glistening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starlight. Gandalf turned <b>and</b> paused. If he <b>was</b> considering <b>what</b> word would close <b>the</b> gate again from within, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> need. Many coiling arms seized <b>the</b> doors <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo they slammed, <b>and</b> all light <b>was</b> lost. A noise <b>of</b> rending <b>and</b> crashing came dully through <b>the</b> ponderous stone.
<br>   Sam, clinging <b>to</b> Frodo's arm, collapsed <b>on</b> a step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black darkness. “Poor old Bill! “he said <b>in</b> a choking voice. “Poor old Bill! Wolves <b>and</b> snakes! But <b>the</b> snakes were too much for him. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose, Mr. Frodo. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come with you.”
<br>   They heard Gandalf go back down <b>the</b> steps <b>and</b> thrust his staff against <b>the</b> doors. There <b>was</b> a quiver <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stairs trembled, .<b>but</b> <b>the</b> doors did not open. “Well, well! “said <b>the</b> wizard. “The passage <b>is</b> blocked behind us now <b>and</b> there <b>is</b> only one way out—<b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. <b>I</b> fear from <b>the</b> sounds that boulders have been piled up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trees uprooted <b>and</b> thrown across <b>the</b> gate. <b>I</b> am sorry; for <b>the</b> trees were beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> stood so long.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> felt that something horrible <b>was</b> near from <b>the</b> moment that my foot first touched <b>the</b> water,” said Frodo. “What <b>was</b> <b>the</b> thing, <b>or</b> were there many <b>of</b> them?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know,” answered Gandalf, “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> arms were all guided <b>by</b> one purpose. Something has crept, <b>or</b> has been driven out <b>of</b> dark waters under <b>the</b> mountains. There are older <b>and</b> fouler things than Orcs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.” He did not speak aloud his <b>thought</b> that whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that dwelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> seized <b>on</b> Frodo first among all <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   Boromir muttered under his breath, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> echoing stone magnified <b>the</b> sound <b>to</b> a hoarse whisper that all could hear: “In <b>the</b> deep places <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us now <b>in</b> this deadly dark?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!”
<br>   As <b>the</b> wizard passed <b>on</b> ahead up <b>the</b> great steps, he held his staff aloft, <b>and</b> from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway <b>was</b> sound <b>and</b> undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad <b>and</b> shallow; <b>and</b> at <b>the</b> top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark.
<br>   “Let us sit <b>and</b> rest <b>and</b> have something <b>to</b> eat, here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing, since we can't find a dining-room! “said Frodo. He <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> shake off <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clutching arm, <b>and</b> suddenly he felt extremely hungry.
<br>   The proposal <b>was</b> welcomed <b>by</b> all; <b>and</b> they sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper steps, dim figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom. After they <b>had</b> eaten, Gandalf gave them each a third sip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miruvor <b>of</b> Rivendell.
<br>   “It will not last much longer, <b>I</b> am afraid,” he said; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> think we need <b>it</b> after that horror at <b>the</b> gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all that <b>is</b> left before we see <b>the</b> other side! Go carefully with <b>the</b> water, too! There are many streams <b>and</b> wells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mines, <b>but</b> they should not be touched. We may not have a chance <b>of</b> filling our skins <b>and</b> bottles till we come down <b>into</b> Dimrill Dale.”
<br>   “How long <b>is</b> that going <b>to</b> take us? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “<b>I</b> cannot say,” answered Gandalf. “It depends <b>on</b> many chances. But going straight, <b>without</b> mishap <b>or</b> losing our way, we shall take three <b>or</b> four marches, <b>I</b> expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door <b>to</b> East-gate <b>in</b> a direct line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road may wind much.”
<br>   After only a brief rest they started <b>on</b> their way again. All were eager <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> journey over as quickly as possible, <b>and</b> were willing, <b>tired</b> as they were, <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked <b>in</b> front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> which just showed <b>the</b> ground before his feet; <b>in</b> his right he held his sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dim light as he turned his head from side <b>to</b> side. Behind <b>the</b> dwarf walked Frodo, <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> drawn <b>the</b> short sword, Sting. No gleam came from <b>the</b> blades <b>of</b> Sting <b>or</b> <b>of</b> Glamdring; <b>and</b> that <b>was</b> some comfort, for being <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Elvish smiths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, <b>and</b> after him Legolas, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> young hobbits, <b>and</b> Boromir. In <b>the</b> dark at <b>the</b> rear, grim <b>and</b> silent, walked Aragorn.
<br>   The passage twisted round a few turns, <b>and</b> then began <b>to</b> descend. It went steadily down for a long while before <b>it</b> became level <b>once</b> again. The air grew hot <b>and</b> stifling, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not foul, <b>and</b> at times they felt currents <b>of</b> cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls. There were many <b>of</b> these. In <b>the</b> pale ray <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's staff, Frodo caught glimpses <b>of</b> stairs <b>and</b> arches <b>and</b> <b>of</b> other passages <b>and</b> tunnels, sloping up, <b>or</b> running steeply down, <b>or</b> opening blankly dark <b>on</b> either side. It <b>was</b> bewildering beyond hope <b>of</b> remembering.
<br>   Gimli aided Gandalf <b>very</b> little, except <b>by</b> his stout courage. At least he <b>was</b> not, as were most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others, troubled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mere darkness <b>in</b> itself. Often <b>the</b> wizard consulted him at points where <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> way <b>was</b> doubtful; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> always Gandalf who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> final word. The Mines <b>of</b> Moria were vast <b>and</b> intricate beyond <b>the</b> imagination <b>of</b> Gimli, Gl?<b>in</b>'s son, dwarf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain-race though he <b>was</b>. To Gandalf <b>the</b> far-off memories <b>of</b> a journey long before were now <b>of</b> little help, <b>but</b> even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom <b>and</b> despite all windings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road he knew whither he wished <b>to</b> go, <b>and</b> he did not falter, as long as there <b>was</b> a path that led towards his goal.
<br>   “Do not be afraid! “said Aragorn. There <b>was</b> a pause longer than usual, <b>and</b> Gandalf <b>and</b> Gimli were whispering together; <b>the</b> others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. “Do not be afraid! <b>I</b> have been with him <b>on</b> many a journey, if never <b>on</b> one so dark; <b>and</b> there are tales <b>of</b> Rivendell <b>of</b> greater deeds <b>of</b> his than any that <b>I</b> have seen. He will not go astray-if there <b>is</b> any path <b>to</b> find. He has led us <b>in</b> here against our fears, <b>but</b> he will lead us out again, at whatever cost <b>to</b> himself. He <b>is</b> surer <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> way home <b>in</b> a blind night than <b>the</b> cats <b>of</b> Queen Ber?thiel.”
<br>   It <b>was</b> well for <b>the</b> Company that they <b>had</b> such a guide. They <b>had</b> <b>no</b> fuel nor any means <b>of</b> making torches; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desperate scramble at <b>the</b> doors many things <b>had</b> been left behind. But <b>without</b> any light they would soon have come <b>to</b> grief. There were not only many roads <b>to</b> choose from, there were also <b>in</b> many places holes <b>and</b> pitfalls, <b>and</b> dark wells beside <b>the</b> path <b>in</b> which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures <b>and</b> chasms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>and</b> floor, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then a crack would open right before their feet. The widest <b>was</b> more than seven feet across, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long before Pippin could summon enough courage <b>to</b> leap over <b>the</b> dreadful gap. The noise <b>of</b> churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel <b>was</b> turning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths.
<br>   “Rope! “muttered Sam. “<b>I</b> knew <b>I</b>'d want <b>it</b>, if <b>I</b> hadn't got <b>it</b>!”
<br>   As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed <b>to</b> have been tramping <b>on</b>, <b>on</b>, endlessly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountains” roots. They were more than weary, <b>and</b> yet there seemed <b>no</b> comfort <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits <b>had</b> risen for a while after his escape, <b>and</b> after food <b>and</b> a draught <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cordial; <b>but</b> now a deep uneasiness, growing <b>to</b> dread, crept over him again. Though he <b>had</b> been healed <b>in</b> Rivendell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife-stroke, that grim wound <b>had</b> not been <b>without</b> effect. His senses were sharper <b>and</b> more aware <b>of</b> things that could not be seen. One sign <b>of</b> change that he soon <b>had</b> noticed <b>was</b> that he could see more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark than any <b>of</b> his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> any case <b>the</b> bearer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring: <b>it</b> hung upon its chain against his breast, <b>and</b> at whiles <b>it</b> seemed a heavy weight. He felt <b>the</b> certainty <b>of</b> evil ahead <b>and</b> <b>of</b> evil following; <b>but</b> he said <b>nothing</b>. He gripped tighter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> doggedly.
<br>   The Company behind him spoke seldom, <b>and</b> then only <b>in</b> hurried whispers. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> their own feet; <b>the</b> dull stump <b>of</b> Gimli's dwarf-boots; <b>the</b> heavy tread <b>of</b> Boromir; <b>the</b> light step <b>of</b> Legolas; <b>the</b> soft, scarce-heard patter <b>of</b> hobbit-feet; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>the</b> slow firm footfalls <b>of</b> Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they heard <b>nothing</b> at all, unless <b>it</b> were occasionally a faint trickle <b>and</b> drip <b>of</b> unseen water. Yet Frodo began <b>to</b> hear, <b>or</b> <b>to</b> imagine that he heard, something else: like <b>the</b> faint fall <b>of</b> soft bare feet. It <b>was</b> never loud enough, <b>or</b> near enough, for him <b>to</b> feel certain that he heard <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> started <b>it</b> never stopped, while <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> moving. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not an echo, for when they halted <b>it</b> pattered <b>on</b> for a little all <b>by</b> itself, <b>and</b> then grew still.
<br>   It <b>was</b> after nightfall when they <b>had</b> entered <b>the</b> Mines. They <b>had</b> been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came <b>to</b> his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening <b>into</b> three passages: all led <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same general direction, eastwards; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> left-hand passage plunged down, while <b>the</b> right-hand climbed up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> middle way seemed <b>to</b> run <b>on</b>, smooth <b>and</b> level <b>but</b> <b>very</b> narrow.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have <b>no</b> memory <b>of</b> this place at all! “said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under <b>the</b> arch. He held up his staff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope <b>of</b> finding some marks <b>or</b> inscription that might help his choice; <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be seen. “<b>I</b> am too weary <b>to</b> decide,” he said, shaking his head. “And <b>I</b> expect that you are all as weary as <b>I</b> am, <b>or</b> wearier. We <b>had</b> better halt here for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night. You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean! In here <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ever dark; <b>but</b> outside <b>the</b> late Moon <b>is</b> riding westward <b>and</b> <b>the</b> middle-night has passed.”
<br>   “Poor old Bill! “said Sam. “<b>I</b> wonder where he <b>is</b>. <b>I</b> hope those wolves haven't got him yet.”
<br>   To <b>the</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great arch they found a stone door: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> half closed, <b>but</b> swung back easily <b>to</b> a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed <b>to</b> lie a wide chamber cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rock.
<br>   “Steady! Steady! “cried Gandalf as Merry <b>and</b> Pippin pushed forward, glad <b>to</b> find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling <b>of</b> shelter than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open passage. “Steady! You <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> inside yet. <b>I</b> will go first.”
<br>   He went <b>in</b> cautiously, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others filed behind. “There! “he said, pointing with his staff <b>to</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole like <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> a well. Broken <b>and</b> rusty chains lay at <b>the</b> edge <b>and</b> trailed down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> black pit. Fragments <b>of</b> stone lay near.
<br>   “One <b>of</b> you might have fallen <b>in</b> <b>and</b> still be wondering when you were going <b>to</b> strike <b>the</b> bottom,” said Aragorn <b>to</b> Merry. “Let <b>the</b> guide go first while you have one.”
<br>   “This seems <b>to</b> have been a guardroom, made for <b>the</b> watching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three passages,” said Gimli. “That hole <b>was</b> plainly a well for <b>the</b> guards” <b>use</b>, covered with a stone lid. But <b>the</b> lid <b>is</b> broken, <b>and</b> we must all take care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.”
<br>   Pippin felt curiously attracted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> well. While <b>the</b> others were unrolling blankets <b>and</b> making beds against <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, as far as possible from <b>the</b> hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> floor, he crept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>and</b> peered over. A chill air seemed <b>to</b> strike his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved <b>by</b> a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, <b>and</b> let <b>it</b> drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there <b>was</b> any sound. Then far below, as if <b>the</b> stone <b>had</b> fallen <b>into</b> deep water <b>in</b> some cavernous place, there came a plunk, <b>very</b> distant, <b>but</b> magnified <b>and</b> repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollow shaft.
<br>   “What's that? “cried Gandalf. He <b>was</b> relieved when Pippin confessed <b>what</b> he <b>had</b> done; <b>but</b> he <b>was</b> angry, <b>and</b> Pippin could see his eye glinting. “Fool <b>of</b> a Took! “he growled. “This <b>is</b> a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself <b>in</b> next time, <b>and</b> then you will be <b>no</b> further nuisance. Now be quiet!”
<br>   Nothing more <b>was</b> heard for several minutes; <b>but</b> then there came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> echoes <b>had</b> died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They sounded disquietingly like signals <b>of</b> some sort; <b>but</b> after a while <b>the</b> knocking died away <b>and</b> <b>was</b> not heard again.
<br>   “That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a hammer, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> have never heard one,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like <b>it</b>. It may have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Peregrin's foolish stone; <b>but</b> probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind again! Let us hope we shall <b>get</b> some rest <b>without</b> further trouble. You, Pippin, can go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first watch, as a reward,” he growled, as he rolled himself <b>in</b> a blanket.
<br>   Pippin sat miserably <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pitch dark; <b>but</b> he kept <b>on</b> turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well. He wished he could cover <b>the</b> hole, if only with a blanket, <b>but</b> he dared not move <b>or</b> go near <b>it</b>, even though Gandalf seemed <b>to</b> be asleep.
<br>   Actually Gandalf <b>was</b> awake, though lying still <b>and</b> silent. He <b>was</b> deep <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>, trying <b>to</b> recall every memory <b>of</b> his former journey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mines, <b>and</b> considering anxiously <b>the</b> next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up <b>and</b> came over <b>to</b> Pippin.
<br>   “Get <b>into</b> a corner <b>and</b> have a sleep, my lad,” he said <b>in</b> a kindly tone. “You want <b>to</b> sleep, <b>I</b> expect. <b>I</b> cannot <b>get</b> a wink, so <b>I</b> may as well <b>do</b> <b>the</b> watching.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> matter with me,” he muttered, as he sat down <b>by</b> <b>the</b> door. “<b>I</b> need smoke! <b>I</b> have not tasted <b>it</b> since <b>the</b> morning before <b>the</b> snowstorm.”
<br>   The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, <b>was</b> a dark glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old wizard huddled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, shielding a glowing chip <b>in</b> his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> puff <b>of</b> smoke.
<br>   It <b>was</b> Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He <b>had</b> sat <b>and</b> watched all alone for about six hours, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> let <b>the</b> others rest. “And <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watches <b>I</b> have made up my mind,” he said. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle way; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like <b>the</b> smell <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left-hand way: there <b>is</b> foul air down there, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> am <b>no</b> guide. <b>I</b> shall take <b>the</b> right-hand passage. It <b>is</b> time we began <b>to</b> climb up again.”
<br>   For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched <b>on</b>; <b>and</b> they met <b>no</b> danger, <b>and</b> heard <b>nothing</b>, <b>and</b> saw <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> faint gleam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-<b>the</b>-wisp <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> them. The passage they <b>had</b> chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge <b>it</b> went <b>in</b> great mounting curves, <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> rose <b>it</b> grew loftier <b>and</b> wider. There were now <b>no</b> openings <b>to</b> other galleries <b>or</b> tunnels <b>on</b> either side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>was</b> level <b>and</b> sound, <b>without</b> pits <b>or</b> cracks. Evidently they <b>had</b> struck <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>had</b> been an important road; <b>and</b> they went forward quicker than they <b>had</b> done <b>on</b> their first march.
<br>   In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured <b>in</b> a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles <b>or</b> more. As <b>the</b> road climbed upwards` Frodo's spirits rose a little; <b>but</b> he still felt oppressed, <b>and</b> still at times he heard, <b>or</b> <b>thought</b> he heard, away behind <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> beyond <b>the</b> fall <b>and</b> patter <b>of</b> their feet, a following footstep that <b>was</b> not an echo.
<br>   They <b>had</b> marched as far as <b>the</b> hobbits could endure <b>without</b> a rest, <b>and</b> all were thinking <b>of</b> a place where they could sleep, when suddenly <b>the</b> walls <b>to</b> right <b>and</b> left vanished. They seemed <b>to</b> have passed through some arched doorway <b>into</b> a black <b>and</b> empty space. There <b>was</b> a great draught <b>of</b> warmer air behind them, <b>and</b> before them <b>the</b> darkness <b>was</b> cold <b>on</b> their faces. They halted <b>and</b> crowded anxiously together.
<br>   Gandalf seemed pleased. “<b>I</b> chose <b>the</b> right way,” he said. “At last we are coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> habitable parts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> guess that we are not far now from <b>the</b> eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than <b>the</b> Dimrill Gate, unless <b>I</b> am mistaken. From <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air we must be <b>in</b> a wide hall. <b>I</b> will now risk a little real light.”
<br>   He raised his staff, <b>and</b> for a brief instant there <b>was</b> blaze like a flash <b>of</b> lightning. Great shadows sprang up <b>and</b> fled, <b>and</b> for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld <b>by</b> many mighty pillars hewn <b>of</b> stone. Before them <b>and</b> <b>on</b> either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished <b>and</b> smooth as glass, flashed <b>and</b> glittered. Three other entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, <b>and</b> one <b>on</b> either side. Then <b>the</b> light went out.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> all that <b>I</b> shall venture <b>on</b> for <b>the</b> present,” said Gandalf. “There used <b>to</b> be great windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain-side, <b>and</b> shafts leading out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mines. <b>I</b> think we have reached them now, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> night outside again, <b>and</b> we cannot tell until morning. If <b>I</b> am right, tomorrow we may actually see <b>the</b> morning peeping <b>in</b>. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meanwhile we <b>had</b> better go <b>no</b> further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> greater part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark road <b>is</b> over. But we are not through yet, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a long way down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gates that open <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world.”
<br>   The Company spent that night <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great cavernous hall, huddled close together <b>in</b> a corner <b>to</b> escape <b>the</b> draught: there seemed <b>to</b> be a steady inflow <b>of</b> chill air through <b>the</b> eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung <b>the</b> darkness, hollow <b>and</b> immense, <b>and</b> they were oppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loneliness <b>and</b> vastness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dolven halls <b>and</b> endlessly branching stairs <b>and</b> passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour <b>had</b> ever suggested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits fell altogether short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual dread <b>and</b> wonder <b>of</b> Moria.
<br>   “There must have been a mighty crowd <b>of</b> dwarves here at one time “said Sam; “<b>and</b> every one <b>of</b> them busier than badgers for five hundred years <b>to</b> make all this, <b>and</b> most <b>in</b> hard rock too! What did they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all for? They didn't live <b>in</b> these darksome holes surely?”
<br>   “These are not holes,” said Gimli. “This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> great realm <b>and</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarrowdelf. And <b>of</b> old <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not darksome, <b>but</b> full <b>of</b> light <b>and</b> splendour, as <b>is</b> still remembered <b>in</b> our songs.”
<br>   He rose <b>and</b> standing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark he began <b>to</b> chant <b>in</b> a deep voice, while <b>the</b> echoes ran away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof.
<br>   
<br>The world <b>was</b> young, <b>the</b> mountains green,
<br>No stain yet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon <b>was</b> seen,
<br>No words were laid <b>on</b> stream <b>or</b> stone
<br>When Durin woke <b>and</b> walked alone.
<br>He named <b>the</b> nameless hills <b>and</b> dells;
<br>He drank from yet untasted wells;
<br>He stooped <b>and</b> looked <b>in</b> Mirrormere,
<br>And saw a crown <b>of</b> stars appear,
<br>As gems upon a silver thread,
<br>Above <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> his head.
<br>
<br>The world <b>was</b> fair, <b>the</b> mountains tall,
<br>In Elder Days before <b>the</b> fall
<br>Of mighty kings <b>in</b> Nargothrond
<br>And Gondolin, who now beyond
<br>The Western Seas have passed away:
<br>The world <b>was</b> fair <b>in</b> Durin's Day.
<br>
<br>A king he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> carven throne
<br>In many-pillared halls <b>of</b> stone
<br>With golden roof <b>and</b> silver floor,
<br>And runes <b>of</b> power upon <b>the</b> door.
<br>The light <b>of</b> sun <b>and</b> star <b>and</b> moon
<br>In shining lamps <b>of</b> crystal hewn
<br>Undimmed <b>by</b> cloud <b>or</b> shade <b>of</b> night
<br>There shone for ever fair <b>and</b> bright.
<br>
<br>There hammer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> anvil smote,
<br>There chisel clove, <b>and</b> graver wrote;
<br>There forged <b>was</b> blade, <b>and</b> bound <b>was</b> hilt;
<br>The delver mined, <b>the</b> mason built.
<br>There beryl, pearl, <b>and</b> opal pale,
<br>And metal wrought like fishes” mail,
<br>Buckler <b>and</b> corslet, axe <b>and</b> sword,
<br>And shining spears were laid <b>in</b> hoard.
<br>
<br>Unwearied then were Durin's folk
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> mountains music woke:
<br>The harpers harped, <b>the</b> minstrels sang,
<br>And at <b>the</b> gates <b>the</b> trumpets rang.
<br>
<br>The world <b>is</b> grey, <b>the</b> mountains old,
<br>The forge's fire <b>is</b> ashen-cold
<br>No harp <b>is</b> wrung, <b>no</b> hammer falls:
<br>The darkness dwells <b>in</b> Durin's halls
<br>The shadow lies upon his tomb
<br>In Moria, <b>in</b> Khazad-d?m.
<br>But still <b>the</b> sunken stars appear
<br>In dark <b>and</b> windless Mirrormere;
<br>There lies his crown <b>in</b> water deep,
<br>Till Durin wakes again from sleep.
<br>   
<br>   “<b>I</b> like that! “said Sam. “<b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> learn <b>it</b>. In Moria, <b>in</b> Khazad-d?m! But <b>it</b> makes <b>the</b> darkness seem heavier, thinking <b>of</b> all those lamps. Are there piles <b>of</b> jewels <b>and</b> gold lying about here still?”
<br>   Gimli <b>was</b> silent. Having sung his song he would say <b>no</b> more.
<br>   “Piles <b>of</b> jewels? “said Gandalf. “No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper halls. And since <b>the</b> dwarves fled, <b>no</b> one dares <b>to</b> seek <b>the</b> shafts <b>and</b> treasuries down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep places: they are drowned <b>in</b> water—<b>or</b> <b>in</b> a shadow <b>of</b> fear.”
<br>   “Then <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> dwarves want <b>to</b> come back for? “asked Sam.
<br>   “For mithril,” answered Gandalf. “The wealth <b>of</b> Moria <b>was</b> not <b>in</b> gold <b>and</b> jewels, <b>the</b> toys <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves; nor <b>in</b> iron, their servant. Such things they found here, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true, especially iron; <b>but</b> they did not need <b>to</b> delve for them: all things that they desired they could obtain <b>in</b> traffic. For here alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> found Moria-silver, <b>or</b> true-silver as some have called <b>it</b>: mithril <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they <b>do</b> not tell. Its worth <b>was</b> ten times that <b>of</b> gold, <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> beyond price; for little <b>is</b> left above ground, <b>and</b> even <b>the</b> Orcs dare not delve here for <b>it</b>. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras, <b>and</b> down <b>to</b> darkness. The Dwarves tell <b>no</b> tale; <b>but</b> even as mithril <b>was</b> <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> their wealth, so also <b>it</b> <b>was</b> their destruction: they delved too greedily <b>and</b> too deep, <b>and</b> disturbed that from which they fled, Durin's Bane. Of <b>what</b> they brought <b>to</b> light <b>the</b> Orcs have gathered nearly all, <b>and</b> given <b>it</b> <b>in</b> tribute <b>to</b> Sauron, who covets <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Mithril! All folk desired <b>it</b>. It could be beaten like copper, <b>and</b> polished like glass; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves could make <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a metal, light <b>and</b> yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty <b>was</b> like <b>to</b> that <b>of</b> common silver, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> mithril did not tarnish <b>or</b> grow dim. The Elves dearly loved <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> among many uses they made <b>of</b> <b>it</b> ithildin, starmoon, which you saw upon <b>the</b> doors. Bilbo <b>had</b> a corslet <b>of</b> mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> has become <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? Gathering dust still <b>in</b> Michel Delving Mathom-house, <b>I</b> suppose.”
<br>   “What? “cried Gimli, startled out <b>of</b> his silence. “A corslet <b>of</b> Moria-silver? That <b>was</b> a kingly gift!”
<br>   “Yes,” said Gandalf. “<b>I</b> never told him, <b>but</b> its worth <b>was</b> greater than <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole Shire <b>and</b> everything <b>in</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo said <b>nothing</b>, <b>but</b> he put his hand under his tunic <b>and</b> touched <b>the</b> rings <b>of</b> his mail-shirt. He felt staggered <b>to</b> think that he <b>had</b> been walking about with <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt <b>no</b> doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It <b>was</b> indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts <b>had</b> been carried away from <b>the</b> dark Mines, <b>to</b> Rivendell, <b>to</b> Bilbo, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Bag End <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days while Bilbo <b>was</b> still there. He wished with all his heart that he <b>was</b> back there, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> those days, mowing <b>the</b> lawn, <b>or</b> pottering among <b>the</b> flowers, <b>and</b> that he <b>had</b> never heard <b>of</b> Moria, <b>or</b> mithril—<b>or</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   A deep silence fell. One <b>by</b> one <b>the</b> others fell asleep. Frodo <b>was</b> <b>on</b> guard. As if <b>it</b> were a breath that came <b>in</b> through unseen doors out <b>of</b> deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold <b>and</b> his brow damp. He listened. All his mind <b>was</b> given <b>to</b> listening <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> else for two slow hours; <b>but</b> he heard <b>no</b> sound, not even <b>the</b> imagined echo <b>of</b> a footfall.
<br>   His watch <b>was</b> nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that <b>the</b> western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points <b>of</b> light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head <b>had</b> nodded. “<b>I</b> must have nearly fallen asleep <b>on</b> guard,” he <b>thought</b>. “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a dream.” He stood up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes, <b>and</b> remained standing, peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark, until he <b>was</b> relieved <b>by</b> Legolas.
<br>   When he lay down he quickly went <b>to</b> sleep, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>the</b> dream went <b>on</b>: he heard whispers, <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> two pale points <b>of</b> light approaching, slowly. He woke <b>and</b> found that <b>the</b> others were speaking softly near him, <b>and</b> that a dim light <b>was</b> falling <b>on</b> his face. High up above <b>the</b> eastern archway through a shaft near <b>the</b> roof came a long pale gleam; <b>and</b> across <b>the</b> hall through <b>the</b> northern arch light also glimmered faint <b>and</b> distantly.
<br>   Frodo sat up. “Good morning! “said Gandalf: “For morning <b>it</b> <b>is</b> again at last. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> right, you see. We are high up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> Moria. Before today <b>is</b> over we ought <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Great Gates <b>and</b> see <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> Mirrormere lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dimrill Dale before us.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> shall be glad,” said Gimli. “<b>I</b> have looked <b>on</b> Moria, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> great, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has become dark <b>and</b> dreadful; <b>and</b> we have found <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> my kindred. <b>I</b> doubt now that Balin ever came here.”
<br>   After they <b>had</b> breakfasted Gandalf decided <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> again at <b>once</b>. “We are <b>tired</b>, <b>but</b> we shall rest better when we are outside,” he said. “<b>I</b> think that none <b>of</b> us will wish <b>to</b> spend another night <b>in</b> Moria.”
<br>   “No indeed! “said Boromir. “Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch?”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Gandalf. “But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know yet exactly where we are. Unless <b>I</b> am quite astray, <b>I</b> guess that we are above <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Gates; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may not be easy <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> right road down <b>to</b> them. The eastern arch will probably prove <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> way that we must take; <b>but</b> before we make up our minds we ought <b>to</b> look about us. Let us go towards that light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north door. If we could find a window <b>it</b> would help, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> fear that <b>the</b> light comes only down deep shafts.”
<br>   Following his lead <b>the</b> Company passed under <b>the</b> northern arch. They found themselves <b>in</b> a wide corridor. As they went along <b>it</b> <b>the</b> glimmer grew stronger, <b>and</b> they saw that <b>it</b> came through a doorway <b>on</b> their right. It <b>was</b> high <b>and</b> flat-topped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone door <b>was</b> still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a large square chamber. It <b>was</b> dimly lit, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> their eyes, after so long a time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>it</b> seemed dazzlingly bright, <b>and</b> they blinked as they entered.
<br>   Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> stumbled among things lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out. The chamber <b>was</b> lit <b>by</b> a wide shaft high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> further eastern wall; <b>it</b> slanted upwards <b>and</b>, far above, a small square patch <b>of</b> blue sky could be seen. The light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaft fell directly <b>on</b> a table <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which <b>was</b> laid a great slab <b>of</b> white stone.
<br>   “It looks like a tomb,” muttered Frodo, <b>and</b> bent forwards with a curious sense <b>of</b> foreboding, <b>to</b> look more closely at <b>it</b>. Gandalf came quickly <b>to</b> his side. On <b>the</b> slab runes were deeply graven:
<br>   
<br>   
<br>   “These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used <b>of</b> old <b>in</b> Moria,” said Gandalf. “Here <b>is</b> written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tongues <b>of</b> Men <b>and</b> Dwarves:
<br>   
<br>balin son <b>of</b> fundin
<br>lord <b>of</b> moria.”
<br>   
<br>   “He <b>is</b> dead then,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> feared <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so.” Gimli cast his hood over his face.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 5
<br><b>THE</b> BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-D?M
<br>
<br>   The Company <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring stood silent beside <b>the</b> tomb <b>of</b> Balin. Frodo <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Bilbo <b>and</b> his long friendship with <b>the</b> dwarf, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Balin's visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains <b>it</b> seemed a thousand years ago <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world.
<br>   At length they stirred <b>and</b> looked up, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> search for anything that would give them tidings <b>of</b> Balin's fate, <b>or</b> show <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become <b>of</b> his folk. There <b>was</b> another smaller door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, under <b>the</b> shaft. By both <b>the</b> doors they could now see that many bones were lying, <b>and</b> among them were broken swords <b>and</b> axe-heads, <b>and</b> cloven shields <b>and</b> helms. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.
<br>   There were many recesses cut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> them were large iron-bound chests <b>of</b> wood. All <b>had</b> been broken <b>and</b> plundered; <b>but</b> beside <b>the</b> shattered lid <b>of</b> one there lay <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> a <b>book</b>. It <b>had</b> been slashed <b>and</b> stabbed <b>and</b> partly burned, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so stained with black <b>and</b> other dark marks like old blood that little <b>of</b> <b>it</b> could be read. Gandalf lifted <b>it</b> carefully, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> leaves crackled <b>and</b> broke as he laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slab. He pored over <b>it</b> for some time <b>without</b> speaking. Frodo <b>and</b> Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned <b>the</b> leaves, that they were written <b>by</b> many different hands, <b>in</b> runes, both <b>of</b> Moria <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Dale, <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there <b>in</b> Elvish script.
<br>   At last Gandalf looked up. “It seems <b>to</b> be a record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortunes <b>of</b> Balin's folk,” he said. “<b>I</b> guess that <b>it</b> began with their coming <b>to</b> Dimrill Dale nigh <b>on</b> thirty years ago: <b>the</b> pages seem <b>to</b> have numbers referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> years after their arrival. The top page <b>is</b> marked one—three, so at least two are missing from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>. Listen <b>to</b> this!
<br>   “We drove out orcs from <b>the</b> great gate <b>and</b> guard—<b>I</b> think; <b>the</b> next word <b>is</b> blurred <b>and</b> burned; probably room—we slew many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bright—<b>I</b> think—sun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dale. Fl?i <b>was</b> killed <b>by</b> an arrow. He slew <b>the</b> great. Then there <b>is</b> a blur followed <b>by</b> Fl?i under grass near Mirror mere. The next line <b>or</b> two <b>I</b> cannot read. Then comes We have taken <b>the</b> twentyfirst hall <b>of</b> North end <b>to</b> dwell <b>in</b>. There <b>is</b> <b>I</b> cannot read <b>what</b>. A shaft <b>is</b> mentioned. Then Balin has set up his seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul.”
<br>   “The Chamber <b>of</b> Records,” said Gimli. “<b>I</b> guess that <b>is</b> where we now stand.”
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> can read <b>no</b> more for a long way,” said Gandalf, “except <b>the</b> word gold, <b>and</b> Durin's Axe <b>and</b> something helm. Then Balin <b>is</b> now lord <b>of</b> Moria. That seems <b>to</b> end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can see we found truesilver, <b>and</b> later <b>the</b> word wellforged <b>and</b> then something, <b>I</b> have <b>it</b>! mithril; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last two lines ?<b>in</b> <b>to</b> seek for <b>the</b> upper armouries <b>of</b> Third Deep, something go westwards, a blur, <b>to</b> Hollin gate.”
<br>   Gandalf paused <b>and</b> set a few leaves aside. “There are several pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sort, rather hastily written <b>and</b> much damaged, he said; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> can make little <b>of</b> them <b>in</b> this light. Now there must be a number <b>of</b> leaves missing, because they begin <b>to</b> be numbered five, <b>the</b> fifth year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony, <b>I</b> suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut <b>and</b> stained; <b>I</b> cannot read them. We might <b>do</b> better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. Wait! Here <b>is</b> something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script.”
<br>   “That would be Ori's hand,” said Gimli, looking over <b>the</b> wizard's arm. “He could write well <b>and</b> speedily, <b>and</b> often used <b>the</b> Elvish characters.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> fear he <b>had</b> ill tidings <b>to</b> record <b>in</b> a fair hand,” said Gandalf. “The first clear word <b>is</b> sorrow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line <b>is</b> lost, unless <b>it</b> ends <b>in</b> estre. Yes, <b>it</b> must be yestre followed <b>by</b> day being <b>the</b> tenth <b>of</b> novembre Balin lord <b>of</b> Moria fell <b>in</b> Dimrill Dale. He went alone <b>to</b> look <b>in</b> Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew <b>the</b> orc, hut many more ... up from east up <b>the</b> Silverlode. The remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> page <b>is</b> so blurred that <b>I</b> can hardly make anything out, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> can read we have barred <b>the</b> gates, <b>and</b> then can hold them long if, <b>and</b> then perhaps horrible <b>and</b> suffer. Poor Balin! He seems <b>to</b> have kept <b>the</b> title that he took for less than five years. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> happened afterwards; <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> puzzle out <b>the</b> last few pages. Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last page <b>of</b> all.” He paused <b>and</b> sighed.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> grim <b>reading</b>,” he said. “<b>I</b> fear their end <b>was</b> cruel. Listen! We cannot <b>get</b> out. We cannot <b>get</b> out. They have taken <b>the</b> Bridge <b>and</b> second hall. Fr?r <b>and</b> L?ni <b>and</b> N?li fell there. Then there are four lines smeared so that <b>I</b> can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run <b>the</b> pool <b>is</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall at Westgate. The Watcher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Water took ?<b>in</b>. We cannot <b>get</b> out. The end comes, <b>and</b> then drums, drums <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> that means. The last thing written <b>is</b> <b>in</b> a trailing scrawl <b>of</b> elf-letters: they are coming. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> more.” Gandalf paused <b>and</b> stood <b>in</b> silent <b>thought</b>.
<br>   A sudden dread <b>and</b> a horror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company. “We cannot <b>get</b> out,” muttered Gimli. “It <b>was</b> well for us that <b>the</b> pool <b>had</b> sunk a little, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> Watcher <b>was</b> sleeping down at <b>the</b> southern end.”
<br>   Gandalf raised his head <b>and</b> looked round. “They seem <b>to</b> have made a last stand <b>by</b> both doors,” he said; “<b>but</b> there were not many left <b>by</b> that time. So ended <b>the</b> attempt <b>to</b> retake Moria! It <b>was</b> valiant <b>but</b> foolish. The time <b>is</b> not come yet. Now, <b>I</b> fear, we must say farewell <b>to</b> Balin son <b>of</b> Fundin. Here he must lie <b>in</b> <b>the</b> halls <b>of</b> his fathers. We will take this <b>book</b>, <b>the</b> Book <b>of</b> Mazarbul, <b>and</b> look at <b>it</b> more closely later. You <b>had</b> better keep <b>it</b>, Gimli, <b>and</b> take <b>it</b> back <b>to</b> D?<b>in</b>, if you <b>get</b> a chance. It will interest him, though <b>it</b> will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning <b>is</b> passing.”
<br>   “Which way shall we go? “asked Boromir.
<br>   “Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall,” answered Gandalf. “But our visit <b>to</b> this room has not been <b>in</b> vain. <b>I</b> now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hall must be <b>the</b> twenty-first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North-end. Therefore we should leave <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eastern arch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> bear right <b>and</b> south, <b>and</b> go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Seventh Level, that <b>is</b> six above <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates. Come now! Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hall!”
<br>   Gandalf <b>had</b> hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling Boom that seemed <b>to</b> come from depths far below, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> tremble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stone at their feet. They sprang towards <b>the</b> door <b>in</b> alarm. Doom, doom <b>it</b> rolled again, as if huge hands were turning <b>the</b> <b>very</b> caverns <b>of</b> Moria <b>into</b> a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn <b>was</b> blown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall, <b>and</b> answering horns <b>and</b> harsh cries were heard further off. There <b>was</b> a hurrying sound <b>of</b> many feet.
<br>   “They are coming! “cried Legolas.
<br>   “We cannot <b>get</b> out,” said Gimli.
<br>   “Trapped! “cried Gandalf. “Why did <b>I</b> delay? Here we are, caught, just as they were before. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not here then. We will see <b>what</b> ——”
<br>   Doom, doom came <b>the</b> drum-beat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walls shook.
<br>   “Slam <b>the</b> doors <b>and</b> wedge them! “shouted Aragorn. “And keep your packs <b>on</b> as long as you can: we may <b>get</b> a chance <b>to</b> cut our way out yet.”
<br>   “No! “said Gandalf. “We must not <b>get</b> shut <b>in</b>. Keep <b>the</b> east door ajar! We will go that way, if we <b>get</b> a chance.”
<br>   Another harsh horn-call <b>and</b> shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming down <b>the</b> corridor. There <b>was</b> a ring <b>and</b> clatter as <b>the</b> Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, <b>and</b> Sting glinted at <b>the</b> edges. Boromir set his shoulder against <b>the</b> western door.
<br>   “Wait a moment! Do not close <b>it</b> yet! “said Gandalf. He sprang forward <b>to</b> Boromir's side <b>and</b> drew himself up <b>to</b> his full height.
<br>   “Who comes hither <b>to</b> disturb <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Balin Lord <b>of</b> Moria? “he cried <b>in</b> a loud voice.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a rush <b>of</b> hoarse laughter, like <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> sliding stones <b>into</b> a pit; amid <b>the</b> clamour a deep voice <b>was</b> raised <b>in</b> command. Doom, boom, doom went <b>the</b> drums <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep.
<br>   With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before <b>the</b> narrow opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> thrust forward his staff: There <b>was</b> a dazzling flash that lit <b>the</b> chamber <b>and</b> <b>the</b> passage outside. For an instant <b>the</b> wizard looked out. Arrows whined <b>and</b> whistled down <b>the</b> corridor as he sprang back.
<br>   “There are Orcs, <b>very</b> many <b>of</b> them,” he said. “And some are large <b>and</b> evil: black Uruks <b>of</b> Mordor. For <b>the</b> moment they are hanging back, <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> something else there. A great cave-troll, <b>I</b> think, <b>or</b> more than one. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> hope <b>of</b> escape that way.”
<br>   “And <b>no</b> hope at all, if they come at <b>the</b> other door as well,” said Boromir.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> sound outside here yet,” said Aragorn, who <b>was</b> standing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> eastern door listening. “The passage <b>on</b> this side plunges straight down a stair: <b>it</b> plainly does not lead back towards <b>the</b> hall. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good flying blindly this way with <b>the</b> pursuit just behind. We cannot block <b>the</b> door. Its key <b>is</b> gone <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lock <b>is</b> broken, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> opens inwards. We must <b>do</b> something <b>to</b> delay <b>the</b> enemy first. We will make them fear <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul!” he said grimly feeling <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> his sword, And?ril.
<br>   Heavy feet were heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corridor. Boromir flung himself against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> heaved <b>it</b> <b>to</b>; then he wedged <b>it</b> with broken sword-blades <b>and</b> splinters <b>of</b> wood. The Company retreated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber. But they <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance <b>to</b> fly yet. There <b>was</b> a blow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door that made <b>it</b> quiver; <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> grind slowly open, driving back <b>the</b> wedges. A huge arm <b>and</b> shoulder, with a dark skin <b>of</b> greenish scales, <b>was</b> thrust through <b>the</b> widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot <b>was</b> forced through below. There <b>was</b> a dead silence outside.
<br>   Boromir leaped forward <b>and</b> hewed at <b>the</b> arm with all his might; <b>but</b> his sword rang, glanced aside, <b>and</b> fell from his shaken hand. The blade <b>was</b> notched.
<br>   Suddenly, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up <b>in</b> his heart. “The Shire! “he cried, <b>and</b> springing beside Boromir, he stooped, <b>and</b> stabbed with Sting at <b>the</b> hideous foot. There <b>was</b> a bellow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> foot jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops dripped from <b>the</b> blade <b>and</b> smoked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. Boromir hurled himself against <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> slammed <b>it</b> again.
<br>   “One for <b>the</b> Shire! “cried Aragorn. “The hobbit's bite <b>is</b> deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo!”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a crash <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door, followed <b>by</b> crash after crash. Rams <b>and</b> hammers were beating against <b>it</b>. It cracked <b>and</b> staggered back, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling <b>in</b>, <b>but</b> struck <b>the</b> northern wall, <b>and</b> fell harmlessly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. There <b>was</b> a horn-blast <b>and</b> a rush <b>of</b> feet, <b>and</b> orcs one after another leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber.
<br>   How many there were <b>the</b> Company could not count. The affray <b>was</b> sharp, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> orcs were dismayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fierceness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defence. Legolas shot two through <b>the</b> throat. Gimli hewed <b>the</b> legs from under another that <b>had</b> sprung up <b>on</b> Balin's tomb. Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn slew many. When thirteen <b>had</b> fallen <b>the</b> rest fled shrieking. leaving <b>the</b> defenders unharmed, except for Sam who <b>had</b> a scratch along <b>the</b> scalp. A quick duck <b>had</b> saved him; <b>and</b> he <b>had</b> felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire <b>was</b> smouldering <b>in</b> his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards, if he <b>had</b> seen <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time! “cried Gandalf. “Let us go, before <b>the</b> troll returns!”
<br>   But even as they retreated, <b>and</b> before Pippin <b>and</b> Merry <b>had</b> reached <b>the</b> stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad <b>in</b> black mail from head <b>to</b> foot, leaped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber; behind him his followers clustered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doorway. His broad flat face <b>was</b> swart, his eyes were like coals, <b>and</b> his tongue <b>was</b> red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust <b>of</b> his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword <b>and</b> bore him backwards, throwing him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> a striking snake he charged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>and</b> thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, <b>and</b> Frodo <b>was</b> hurled against <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at <b>the</b> spear-shaft, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> broke. But even as <b>the</b> orc flung down <b>the</b> truncheon <b>and</b> swept out his scimitar, And?ril came down upon his helm. There <b>was</b> a flash like flame <b>and</b> <b>the</b> helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn sprang at them.
<br>   Doom, doom went <b>the</b> drums <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep. The great voice rolled out again.
<br>   “Now! “shouted Gandalf. “Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> last chance. Run for <b>it</b>!”
<br>   Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wall <b>and</b> made for <b>the</b> stair, pushing Merry <b>and</b> Pippin <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> him. The others followed; <b>but</b> Gimli <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be dragged away <b>by</b> Legolas: <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peril he lingered <b>by</b> Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled <b>the</b> eastern door <b>to</b>, grinding upon its hinges: <b>it</b> <b>had</b> great iron rings <b>on</b> either side, <b>but</b> could not be fastened.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am all right,” gasped Frodo. “<b>I</b> can walk. Put me down!”
<br>   Aragorn nearly dropped him <b>in</b> his amazement. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you were dead! “he cried.
<br>   “Not yet! “said Gandalf. “But there <b>is</b> time for wonder. Off you go, all <b>of</b> you, down <b>the</b> stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at <b>the</b> bottom, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come soon, go <b>on</b>! Go quickly <b>and</b> choose paths leading right <b>and</b> downwards.”
<br>   “We cannot leave you <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> door alone! “said Aragorn.
<br>   “Do as <b>I</b> say! “said Gandalf fiercely. “Swords are <b>no</b> more <b>use</b> here. Go!”
<br>   The passage <b>was</b> lit <b>by</b> <b>no</b> shaft <b>and</b> <b>was</b> utterly dark. They groped their way down a long flight <b>of</b> steps, <b>and</b> then looked back; <b>but</b> they could see <b>nothing</b>, except high above them <b>the</b> faint glimmer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wizard's staff. He seemed <b>to</b> be still standing <b>on</b> guard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> closed door. Frodo breathed heavily <b>and</b> leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up <b>the</b> stairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Frodo <b>thought</b> he could hear <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down <b>the</b> sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said. The walls seemed <b>to</b> be trembling. Every now <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> drum-beats throbbed <b>and</b> rolled: doom, doom.
<br>   Suddenly at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stair there <b>was</b> a stab <b>of</b> white light. Then there <b>was</b> a dull rumble <b>and</b> a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: doom-boom, doom-boom, <b>and</b> then stopped. Gandalf came flying down <b>the</b> steps <b>and</b> fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Well, well! That's over! “said <b>the</b> wizard struggling <b>to</b> his feet. “<b>I</b> have done all that <b>I</b> could. But <b>I</b> have met my match, <b>and</b> have nearly been destroyed. But don't stand here! Go <b>on</b>! You will have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>without</b> light for a while: <b>I</b> am rather shaken. Go <b>on</b>! Go <b>on</b>! Where are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all <b>of</b> you!”
<br>   They stumbled after him wondering <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened. Doom, doom went <b>the</b> drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled <b>and</b> far away, <b>but</b> they were following. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> other sound <b>of</b> pursuit, neither tramp <b>of</b> feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took <b>no</b> turns, right <b>or</b> left, for <b>the</b> passage seemed <b>to</b> be going <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction that he desired. Every now <b>and</b> again <b>it</b> descended a flight <b>of</b> steps, fifty <b>or</b> more, <b>to</b> a lower level. At <b>the</b> moment that <b>was</b> their chief danger; for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark they could not see a descent, until they came <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> put their feet out <b>into</b> emptiness. Gandalf felt <b>the</b> ground with his staff like a blind man.
<br>   At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> an hour they <b>had</b> gone a mile, <b>or</b> maybe a little more, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> descended many flights <b>of</b> stairs. There <b>was</b> still <b>no</b> sound <b>of</b> pursuit. Almost they began <b>to</b> hope that they would escape. At <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh flight Gandalf halted.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> getting hot! “he gasped. “We ought <b>to</b> be down at least <b>to</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates now. Soon <b>I</b> think we should look for a left-hand turn <b>to</b> take us east. <b>I</b> hope <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not far. <b>I</b> am <b>very</b> weary. <b>I</b> must rest here a moment, even if all <b>the</b> orcs ever spawned are after us.”
<br>   Gimli took his arm <b>and</b> helped him down <b>to</b> a seat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step. “What happened away up there at <b>the</b> door? “he asked. “Did you meet <b>the</b> beater <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drums?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know,” answered Gandalf. “But <b>I</b> found myself suddenly faced <b>by</b> something that <b>I</b> have not met before. <b>I</b> could think <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> put a shutting-spell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. <b>I</b> know many; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things <b>of</b> that kind rightly requires time, <b>and</b> even then <b>the</b> door can be broken <b>by</b> strength.
<br>   “As <b>I</b> stood there <b>I</b> could hear orc-voices <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side: at any moment <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> they would burst <b>it</b> open. <b>I</b> could not hear <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said; they seemed <b>to</b> be talking <b>in</b> their own hideous language. All <b>I</b> caught <b>was</b> gh?sh; that <b>is</b> “fire". Then something came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chamber—<b>I</b> felt <b>it</b> through <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> orcs themselves were afraid <b>and</b> fell silent. It laid hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron ring, <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> perceived me <b>and</b> my spell.
<br>   “What <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> cannot guess, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell <b>was</b> terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant <b>the</b> door left my control <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> open! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> speak a word <b>of</b> Command. That proved too great a strain. The door burst <b>in</b> pieces. Something dark as a cloud <b>was</b> blocking out all <b>the</b> light inside, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thrown backwards down <b>the</b> stairs. All <b>the</b> wall gave way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber as well, <b>I</b> think.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am afraid Balin <b>is</b> buried deep, <b>and</b> maybe something else <b>is</b> buried there too. <b>I</b> cannot say. But at least <b>the</b> passage behind us <b>was</b> completely blocked. Ah! <b>I</b> have never felt so spent, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> passing. And now <b>what</b> about you, Frodo? There <b>was</b> not time <b>to</b> say so, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have never been more delighted <b>in</b> my life than when you spoke. <b>I</b> feared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a brave <b>but</b> dead hobbit that Aragorn <b>was</b> carrying.”
<br>   “What about me? “said Frodo. “<b>I</b> am alive, <b>and</b> whole <b>I</b> think. <b>I</b> am bruised <b>and</b> <b>in</b> pain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not too bad.”
<br>   “Well,” said Aragorn, “<b>I</b> can only say that hobbits are made <b>of</b> a stuff so tough that <b>I</b> have never met <b>the</b> like <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Had <b>I</b> known, <b>I</b> would have spoken softer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar!”
<br>   “Well, <b>it</b> did not skewer me, <b>I</b> am glad <b>to</b> say,” said Frodo; “though <b>I</b> feel as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been caught between a hammer <b>and</b> an anvil.” He said <b>no</b> more. He found breathing painful.
<br>   “You take after Bilbo,” said Gandalf. “There <b>is</b> more about you than meets <b>the</b> eye, as <b>I</b> said <b>of</b> him long ago.” Frodo wondered if <b>the</b> remark meant more than <b>it</b> said.
<br>   They now went <b>on</b> again. Before long Gimli spoke. He <b>had</b> keen eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark. “<b>I</b> think,” he said, “that there <b>is</b> a light ahead. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not daylight. It <b>is</b> red. What can <b>it</b> be?”
<br>   “Gh?sh!” muttered Gandalf. “<b>I</b> wonder if that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they meant: that <b>the</b> lower levels are <b>on</b> fire? Still, we can only go <b>on</b>.”
<br>   Soon <b>the</b> light became unmistakable, <b>and</b> could be seen <b>by</b> all. It <b>was</b> flickering <b>and</b> glowing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls away down <b>the</b> passage before them. They could now see their way: <b>in</b> front <b>the</b> road sloped down swiftly, <b>and</b> some way ahead there stood a low archway; through <b>it</b> <b>the</b> glowing light came. The air became <b>very</b> hot.
<br>   When they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arch Gandalf went through, signing <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> wait. As he stood just beyond <b>the</b> opening they saw his face lit <b>by</b> a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> some new devilry here,” he said, “devised for our welcome <b>no</b> doubt. But <b>I</b> know now where we are: we have reached <b>the</b> First Deep, <b>the</b> level immediately below <b>the</b> Gates. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Second Hall <b>of</b> Old Moria; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gates are near: away beyond <b>the</b> eastern end, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left, not more than a quarter <b>of</b> a mile. Across <b>the</b> Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road through <b>the</b> First Hall, <b>and</b> out! But come <b>and</b> look!”
<br>   They peered out. Before them <b>was</b> another cavernous hall. It <b>was</b> loftier <b>and</b> far longer than <b>the</b> one <b>in</b> which they <b>had</b> slept. They were near its eastern end; westward <b>it</b> ran away <b>into</b> darkness. Down <b>the</b> centre stalked a double line <b>of</b> towering pillars. They were carved like boles <b>of</b> mighty trees whose boughs upheld <b>the</b> roof with a branching tracery <b>of</b> stone. Their stems were smooth <b>and</b> black, <b>but</b> a red glow <b>was</b> darkly mirrored <b>in</b> their sides. Right across <b>the</b> floor, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> two huge pillars a great fissure <b>had</b> opened. Out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> a fierce red light came, <b>and</b> now <b>and</b> again flames licked at <b>the</b> brink <b>and</b> curled about <b>the</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> columns. Wisps <b>of</b> dark smoke wavered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot air.
<br>   “If we <b>had</b> come <b>by</b> <b>the</b> main road down from <b>the</b> upper halls, we should have been trapped here,” said Gandalf. “Let us hope that <b>the</b> fire now lies between us <b>and</b> pursuit. Come! There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> lose.”
<br>   Even as he spoke they heard again <b>the</b> pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, doom. Away beyond <b>the</b> shadows at <b>the</b> western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall there came cries <b>and</b> horn-calls. Doom, doom: <b>the</b> pillars seemed <b>to</b> tremble <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flames <b>to</b> quiver.
<br>   “Now for <b>the</b> last race! “said Gandalf. “If <b>the</b> sun <b>is</b> shining outside we may still escape. After me!”
<br>   He turned left <b>and</b> sped across <b>the</b> smooth floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall. The distance <b>was</b> greater than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> looked. As they ran they heard <b>the</b> beat <b>and</b> echo <b>of</b> many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they <b>had</b> been seen. There <b>was</b> a ring <b>and</b> clash <b>of</b> steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's head.
<br>   Boromir laughed. “They did not expect this,” he said. “The fire has cut them off. We are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrong side!”
<br>   “Look ahead! “called Gandalf. “The Bridge <b>is</b> near. It <b>is</b> dangerous <b>and</b> narrow.”
<br>   Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>the</b> floor vanished <b>and</b> fell <b>to</b> an unknown depth. The outer door could only be reached <b>by</b> a slender bridge <b>of</b> stone, <b>without</b> kerb <b>or</b> rail, that spanned <b>the</b> chasm with one curving spring <b>of</b> fifty feet. It <b>was</b> an ancient defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves against any enemy that might capture <b>the</b> First Hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> outer passages. They could only pass across <b>it</b> <b>in</b> single file. At <b>the</b> brink Gandalf halted <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others came up <b>in</b> a pack behind.
<br>   “Lead <b>the</b> way, Gimli! “he said. “Pippin <b>and</b> Merry next. Straight <b>on</b> <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> stair beyond <b>the</b> door!”
<br>   Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo <b>and</b> sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf's hat <b>and</b> stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked behind. Beyond <b>the</b> fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed <b>to</b> be hundreds <b>of</b> orcs. They brandished spears <b>and</b> scimitars which shone red as blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> firelight. Doom, doom rolled <b>the</b> drum-beats, growing louder <b>and</b> louder, doom, doom.
<br>   Legolas turned <b>and</b> set an arrow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> string, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a long shot for his small bow. He drew, <b>but</b> his hand fell, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrow slipped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. He gave a cry <b>of</b> dismay <b>and</b> fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs <b>of</b> stone, <b>and</b> flung them down <b>to</b> serve as gangways over <b>the</b> fire. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> trolls that <b>had</b> filled <b>the</b> Elf with terror. The ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orcs <b>had</b> opened, <b>and</b> they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something <b>was</b> coming up behind them. What <b>it</b> <b>was</b> could not be seen: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a great shadow, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> which <b>was</b> a dark form, <b>of</b> man-shape maybe, yet greater; <b>and</b> a power <b>and</b> terror seemed <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> go before <b>it</b>.
<br>   It came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light faded as if a cloud <b>had</b> bent over <b>it</b>. Then with a rush <b>it</b> leaped across <b>the</b> fissure. The flames roared up <b>to</b> greet <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> wreathed about <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> a black smoke swirled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Its streaming mane kindled, <b>and</b> blazed behind <b>it</b>. In its right hand <b>was</b> a blade like a stabbing tongue <b>of</b> fire; <b>in</b> its left <b>it</b> held a whip <b>of</b> many thongs.
<br>   “Ai! ai! “wailed Legolas. “A Balrog! A Balrog <b>is</b> come!”
<br>   Gimli stared with wide eyes. “Durin's Bane! “he cried, <b>and</b> letting his axe fall he covered his face.
<br>   “A Balrog,” muttered Gandalf. “Now <b>I</b> understand.” He faltered <b>and</b> leaned heavily <b>on</b> his staff. “What an evil fortune! And <b>I</b> am already weary.”
<br>   The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled <b>and</b> poured over <b>the</b> stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn <b>and</b> blew. Loud <b>the</b> challenge rang <b>and</b> bellowed, like <b>the</b> shout <b>of</b> many throats under <b>the</b> cavernous roof. For a moment <b>the</b> orcs quailed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fiery shadow halted. Then <b>the</b> echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out <b>by</b> a dark wind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enemy advanced again.
<br>   “Over <b>the</b> bridge!” cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. “Fly! This <b>is</b> a foe beyond any <b>of</b> you. <b>I</b> must hold <b>the</b> narrow way. Fly! “Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir did not heed <b>the</b> command, <b>but</b> still held their ground, side <b>by</b> side, behind Gandalf at <b>the</b> far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The others halted just within <b>the</b> doorway at <b>the</b> hall's end, <b>and</b> turned, unable <b>to</b> leave their leader <b>to</b> face <b>the</b> enemy alone.
<br>   The Balrog reached <b>the</b> bridge. Gandalf stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> span, leaning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff <b>in</b> his left hand, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold <b>and</b> white. His enemy halted again, facing him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow about <b>it</b> reached out like two vast wings. It raised <b>the</b> whip, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thongs whined <b>and</b> cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.
<br>   “You cannot pass,” he said. The orcs stood still, <b>and</b> a dead silence fell. “<b>I</b> am a servant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Secret Fire, wielder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flame <b>of</b> Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame <b>of</b> Ud?n. Go back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shadow! You cannot pass.”
<br>   The Balrog made <b>no</b> answer. The fire <b>in</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> die, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>it</b> drew itself up <b>to</b> a great height, <b>and</b> its wings were spread from wall <b>to</b> wall; <b>but</b> still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom; he seemed small, <b>and</b> altogether alone: grey <b>and</b> bent, like a wizened tree before <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> a storm.
<br>   From out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow a red sword leaped flaming.
<br>   Glamdring glittered white <b>in</b> answer.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a ringing clash <b>and</b> a stab <b>of</b> white fire. The Balrog fell back <b>and</b> its sword flew up <b>in</b> molten fragments. The wizard swayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge, stepped back a pace, <b>and</b> then again stood still.
<br>   “You cannot pass! “he said.
<br>   With a bound <b>the</b> Balrog leaped full upon <b>the</b> bridge. Its whip whirled <b>and</b> hissed.
<br>   “He cannot stand alone! “cried Aragorn suddenly <b>and</b> ran back along <b>the</b> bridge. “Elendil!” he shouted. “<b>I</b> am with you, Gandalf!”
<br>   “Gondor! “cried Boromir <b>and</b> leaped after him.
<br>   At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, <b>and</b> crying aloud he smote <b>the</b> bridge before him. The staff broke asunder <b>and</b> fell from his hand. A blinding sheet <b>of</b> white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at <b>the</b> Balrog's feet <b>it</b> broke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> stone upon which <b>it</b> stood crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gulf, while <b>the</b> rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue <b>of</b> rock thrust out <b>into</b> emptiness.
<br>   With a terrible cry <b>the</b> Balrog fell forward, <b>and</b> its shadow plunged down <b>and</b> vanished. But even as <b>it</b> fell <b>it</b> swung its whip, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thongs lashed <b>and</b> curled about <b>the</b> wizard's knees, dragging him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brink. He staggered <b>and</b> fell, grasped vainly at <b>the</b> stone, <b>and</b> slid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> abyss. “Fly, you fools! “he cried, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> gone.
<br>   The fires went out, <b>and</b> blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit. Even as Aragorn <b>and</b> Boromir came flying back, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge cracked <b>and</b> fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.
<br>   “Come! <b>I</b> will lead you now! “he called. “We must obey his last command. Follow me!”
<br>   They stumbled wildly up <b>the</b> great stairs beyond <b>the</b> door. Aragorn leading, Boromir at <b>the</b> rear. At <b>the</b> top <b>was</b> a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, <b>and</b> then he found that he himself <b>was</b> weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom <b>the</b> drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now <b>and</b> slow; doom!
<br>   They ran <b>on</b>. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced <b>the</b> roof. They ran swifter. They passed <b>into</b> a hall, bright with daylight from its high windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east. They fled across <b>it</b>. Through its huge broken doors they passed, <b>and</b> suddenly before them <b>the</b> Great Gates opened, an arch <b>of</b> blazing light.
<br>   There <b>was</b> a guard <b>of</b> orcs crouching <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows behind <b>the</b> great door posts towering <b>on</b> either side, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> gates were shattered <b>and</b> cast down. Aragorn smote <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> captain that stood <b>in</b> his path, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest fled <b>in</b> terror <b>of</b> his wrath. The Company swept past them <b>and</b> took <b>no</b> heed <b>of</b> them. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates they ran <b>and</b> sprang down <b>the</b> huge <b>and</b> age-worn steps, <b>the</b> threshold <b>of</b> Moria.
<br>   Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under <b>the</b> sky <b>and</b> felt <b>the</b> wind <b>on</b> their faces.
<br>   They did not halt until they were out <b>of</b> bowshot from <b>the</b> walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains lay upon <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> eastwards there <b>was</b> a golden light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land. It <b>was</b> <b>but</b> one hour after noon. The sun <b>was</b> shining; <b>the</b> clouds were white <b>and</b> high.
<br>   They looked back. Dark yawned <b>the</b> archway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates under <b>the</b> mountain-shadow. Faint <b>and</b> far beneath <b>the</b> earth rolled <b>the</b> slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be seen; <b>the</b> dale all around <b>was</b> empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, <b>and</b> they wept long: some standing <b>and</b> silent, some cast upon <b>the</b> ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded.
<br>

<br><b>Chapter</b> 6
<br>LOTHL?RIEN
<br>
<br>   “Alas! <b>I</b> Fear we cannot stay here longer,” said Aragorn. He looked towards <b>the</b> mountains <b>and</b> held up his sword. “Farewell, Gandalf! “he cried. “Did <b>I</b> not say <b>to</b> you: if you pass <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> Moria, beware? Alas that <b>I</b> spoke true! What hope have we <b>without</b> you?”
<br>   He turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company. “We must <b>do</b> <b>without</b> hope,” he said. “At least we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves <b>and</b> weep <b>no</b> more! Come! We have a long road, <b>and</b> much <b>to</b> <b>do</b>.”
<br>   They rose <b>and</b> looked about them. Northward <b>the</b> dale ran up <b>into</b> a glen <b>of</b> shadows between two great arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. <b>the</b> Mountains <b>of</b> Moria. At <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder <b>of</b> short falls, <b>and</b> a mist <b>of</b> foam hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air about <b>the</b> mountains” feet.
<br>   “Yonder <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair,” said Aragorn, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> falls. “Down <b>the</b> deep-cloven way that climbs beside <b>the</b> torrent we should have come, if fortune <b>had</b> been kinder.”
<br>   “Or Caradhras less cruel,” said Gimli. “There he stands smiling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun! “He shook his fist at <b>the</b> furthest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow-capped peaks <b>and</b> turned away.
<br>   To <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> outflung arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains marched <b>to</b> a sudden end, <b>and</b> far lands could be descried beyond them, wide <b>and</b> vague. To <b>the</b> south <b>the</b> Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, <b>and</b> a little below them, for they still stood high up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale, there lay a mere. It <b>was</b> long <b>and</b> oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> northern glen; <b>but</b> its southern end <b>was</b> beyond <b>the</b> shadows under <b>the</b> sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face <b>was</b> still <b>and</b> unruffled. About <b>it</b> lay a smooth sward, shelving down <b>on</b> all sides <b>to</b> its bare unbroken rim.
<br>   “There lies <b>the</b> Mirrormere, deep Kheled-z?ram! “said Gimli sadly. “<b>I</b> remember that he said: “May you have joy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight! But we cannot linger there.” Now long shall <b>I</b> journey ere <b>I</b> have joy again. It <b>is</b> <b>I</b> that must hasten away, <b>and</b> he that must remain.”
<br>   The Company now went down <b>the</b> road from <b>the</b> Gates. It <b>was</b> rough <b>and</b> broken, fading <b>to</b> a winding track between heather <b>and</b> whin that thrust amid <b>the</b> cracking stones. But still <b>it</b> could be seen that <b>once</b> long ago a great paved way <b>had</b> wound upwards from <b>the</b> lowlands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works <b>of</b> stone beside <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> mounds <b>of</b> green topped with slender birches, <b>or</b> fir-trees sighing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. An eastward bend led them hard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sward <b>of</b> Mirrormere, <b>and</b> there not far from <b>the</b> roadside stood a single column broken at <b>the</b> top.
<br>   “That <b>is</b> Durin's Stone! “cried Gimli. “<b>I</b> cannot pass <b>without</b> turning aside for a moment <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> wonder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale!”
<br>   “Be swift then! “said Aragorn, looking back towards <b>the</b> Gates. “The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, <b>but</b> we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon <b>is</b> almost spent, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will be dark tonight.”
<br>   “Come with me, Frodo! “cried <b>the</b> dwarf, springing from <b>the</b> road. “<b>I</b> would not have you go <b>without</b> seeing Kheled-z?ram.” He ran down <b>the</b> long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> still blue water <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> hurt <b>and</b> weariness; Sam came up behind.
<br>   Beside <b>the</b> standing stone Gimli halted <b>and</b> looked up. It <b>was</b> cracked <b>and</b> weather-worn, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> faint runes upon its side could not be read. “This pillar marks <b>the</b> spot where Durin first looked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mirrormere,” said <b>the</b> dwarf. “Let us look ourselves <b>once</b>, ere we go!”
<br>   They stooped over <b>the</b> dark water. At first they could see <b>nothing</b>. Then slowly they saw <b>the</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling mountains mirrored <b>in</b> a profound blue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> peaks were like plumes <b>of</b> white flame above them; beyond there <b>was</b> a space <b>of</b> sky. There like jewels sunk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky above. Of their own stooping forms <b>no</b> shadow could be seen.
<br>   “O Kheled-z?ram fair <b>and</b> wonderful! “said Gimli. “There lies <b>the</b> Crown <b>of</b> Durin till he wakes. Farewell! “He bowed, <b>and</b> turned away, <b>and</b> hastened back up <b>the</b> green-sward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road again.
<br>   “What did you see? “said Pippin <b>to</b> Sam, <b>but</b> Sam <b>was</b> too deep <b>in</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> answer.
<br>   The road now turned south <b>and</b> went quickly downwards, running out from between <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dale. Some way below <b>the</b> mere they came <b>on</b> a deep well <b>of</b> water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip <b>and</b> ran glistening <b>and</b> gurgling down a steep rocky channel.
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> spring from which <b>the</b> Silverlode rises.” said Gimli. “Do not drink <b>of</b> <b>it</b>! It <b>is</b> icy cold.”
<br>   “Soon <b>it</b> becomes a swift river, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> gathers water from many other mountain-streams,” said Aragorn. “Our road leads beside <b>it</b> for many miles. For <b>I</b> shall take you <b>by</b> <b>the</b> road that Gandalf chose, <b>and</b> first <b>I</b> hope <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods where <b>the</b> Silverlode flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Great River-out yonder.” They looked as he pointed, <b>and</b> before them they could see <b>the</b> stream leaping down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trough <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley, <b>and</b> then running <b>on</b> <b>and</b> away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower lands, until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lost <b>in</b> a golden haze.
<br>   “There lie <b>the</b> woods <b>of</b> Lothl?rien! “said Legolas. “That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fairest <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> dwellings <b>of</b> my people. There are <b>no</b> trees like <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> that land. For <b>in</b> <b>the</b> autumn their leaves fall not, <b>but</b> turn <b>to</b> gold. Not till <b>the</b> spring comes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new green opens <b>do</b> they fall, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> boughs are laden with yellow flowers; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>is</b> golden, <b>and</b> golden <b>is</b> <b>the</b> roof, <b>and</b> its pillars are <b>of</b> silver, for <b>the</b> bark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>is</b> smooth <b>and</b> grey. So still our songs <b>in</b> Mirkwood say. My heart would be glad if <b>I</b> were beneath <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> that wood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> were springtime!”
<br>   “My heart will be glad, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter,” said Aragorn. “But <b>it</b> lies many miles away. Let us hasten!”
<br>   For some time Frodo <b>and</b> Sam managed <b>to</b> keep up with <b>the</b> others; <b>but</b> Aragorn <b>was</b> leading them at a great pace, <b>and</b> after a while they lagged behind. They <b>had</b> eaten <b>nothing</b> since <b>the</b> early morning. Sam's cut <b>was</b> burning like fire, <b>and</b> his head felt light. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shining sun <b>the</b> wind seemed chill after <b>the</b> warm darkness <b>of</b> Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful <b>and</b> he gasped for breath.
<br>   At last Legolas turned, <b>and</b> seeing them now far behind, he spoke <b>to</b> Aragorn. The others halted, <b>and</b> Aragorn ran back, calling <b>to</b> Boromir <b>to</b> come with him.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am sorry, Frodo! “he cried, full <b>of</b> concern. “So much has happened this day <b>and</b> we have such need <b>of</b> haste, that <b>I</b> have forgotten that you were hurt; <b>and</b> Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> ease you, as we ought, though all <b>the</b> orcs <b>of</b> Moria were after us. Come now! A little further <b>on</b> there <b>is</b> a place where we can rest for a little. There <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.”
<br>   Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from <b>the</b> west, <b>and</b> joined its bubbling water with <b>the</b> hurrying Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall <b>of</b> green-hued stone, <b>and</b> foamed down <b>into</b> a dell. About <b>it</b> stood fir-trees, short <b>and</b> bent, <b>and</b> its sides were steep <b>and</b> clothed with harts-tongue <b>and</b> shrubs <b>of</b> whortle-berry. At <b>the</b> bottom there <b>was</b> a level space through which <b>the</b> stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It <b>was</b> now nearly three hours after noon, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> come only a few miles from <b>the</b> Gates. Already <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> westering.
<br>   While Gimli <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two younger hobbits kindled a fire <b>of</b> brush- <b>and</b> fir-wood, <b>and</b> drew water, Aragorn tended Sam <b>and</b> Frodo. Sam's wound <b>was</b> not deep, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> looked ugly, <b>and</b> Aragorn's face <b>was</b> grave as he examined <b>it</b>. After a moment he looked up with relief.
<br>   “Good luck, Sam! “he said. “Many have received worse than this <b>in</b> payment for <b>the</b> slaying <b>of</b> their first orc. The cut <b>is</b> not poisoned, as <b>the</b> wounds <b>of</b> orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when <b>I</b> have tended <b>it</b>. Bathe <b>it</b> when Gimli has heated water.”
<br>   He opened his pouch <b>and</b> drew out some withered leaves. “They are dry <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> their virtue has one, he said, <b>but</b> here <b>I</b> have still some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> athelas that <b>I</b> gathered near Weathertop. Crush one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> wash <b>the</b> wound clean, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will bind <b>it</b>. Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> your turn. Frodo!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am all right,” said Frodo, reluctant <b>to</b> have his garments touched. “All <b>I</b> needed <b>was</b> some food <b>and</b> a little rest.”
<br>   “No! “said Aragorn. “We must have a look <b>and</b> see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hammer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> anvil have done <b>to</b> you. <b>I</b> still marvel that you are alive at all.” Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket <b>and</b> worn tunic, <b>and</b> gave a gasp <b>of</b> wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like <b>the</b> light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took <b>it</b> off <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> up, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gems <b>on</b> <b>it</b> glittered like stars. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shaken rings <b>was</b> like <b>the</b> tinkle <b>of</b> rain <b>in</b> a pool.
<br>   “Look, my friends!” he called. “Here's a pretty hobbit-skin <b>to</b> wrap an elven-princeling <b>in</b>! If <b>it</b> were known that hobbits <b>had</b> such hides, all <b>the</b> hunters <b>of</b> Middle-earth would be riding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire.”
<br>   “And all <b>the</b> arrows <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> hunters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world would be <b>in</b> vain,” said Gimli, gazing at <b>the</b> mail <b>in</b> wonder. “It <b>is</b> a mithril-coat. Mithril! <b>I</b> have never seen <b>or</b> heard tell <b>of</b> one so fair. Is this <b>the</b> coat that Gandalf spoke <b>of</b>? Then he undervalued <b>it</b>. But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> well given!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have often wondered <b>what</b> you <b>and</b> Bilbo were doing, so close <b>in</b> his little room,” said Merry. “Bless <b>the</b> old hobbit! <b>I</b> love him more than ever. <b>I</b> hope we <b>get</b> a chance <b>of</b> telling him about <b>it</b>!”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a dark <b>and</b> blackened bruise <b>on</b> Frodo's right side <b>and</b> breast. Under <b>the</b> mail there <b>was</b> a shirt <b>of</b> soft leather, <b>but</b> at one point <b>the</b> rings <b>had</b> been driven through <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flesh. Frodo's left side also <b>was</b> scored <b>and</b> bruised where he <b>had</b> been hurled against <b>the</b> wall. While <b>the</b> others set <b>the</b> food ready. Aragorn bathed <b>the</b> hurts with water <b>in</b> which athelas <b>was</b> steeped. The pungent fragrance filled <b>the</b> dell, <b>and</b> all those who stooped over <b>the</b> steaming water felt refreshed <b>and</b> strengthened. Soon Frodo felt <b>the</b> pain leave him, <b>and</b> his breath grew easy: though he <b>was</b> stiff <b>and</b> sore <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads <b>of</b> cloth at his side.
<br>   “The mail <b>is</b> marvellously light,” he said. “Put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> again, if you can bear <b>it</b>. My heart <b>is</b> glad <b>to</b> know that you have such a coat. Do not lay <b>it</b> aside, even <b>in</b> sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while; <b>and</b> that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.”
<br>   When they <b>had</b> eaten, <b>the</b> Company got ready <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. They put out <b>the</b> fire <b>and</b> hid all traces <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Then climbing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dell they took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road again. They <b>had</b> not gone far before <b>the</b> sun sank behind <b>the</b> westward heights <b>and</b> great shadows crept down <b>the</b> mountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, <b>and</b> mist rose <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollows. Away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> evening light lay pale upon <b>the</b> dim lands <b>of</b> distant plain <b>and</b> wood. Sam <b>and</b> Frodo now feeling eased <b>and</b> greatly refreshed were able <b>to</b> go at a fair pace, <b>and</b> with only one brief halt Aragorn led <b>the</b> Company <b>on</b> for nearly three more hours.
<br>   It <b>was</b> dark. Deep night <b>had</b> fallen. There were many clear stars, hut <b>the</b> fast-waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli <b>and</b> Frodo were at <b>the</b> rear, walking softly <b>and</b> not speaking, listening for any sound upon <b>the</b> road behind. At length Gimli broke <b>the</b> silence.
<br>   “Not a sound <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wind,” he said. “There are <b>no</b> goblins near, <b>or</b> my ears are made <b>of</b> wood. It <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be hoped that <b>the</b> Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe that <b>was</b> all their purpose, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with us-with <b>the</b> Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> plain, if they have a fallen captain <b>to</b> avenge.”
<br>   Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blade <b>was</b> dull. Yet he <b>had</b> heard something, <b>or</b> <b>thought</b> he <b>had</b>. As soon as <b>the</b> shadows <b>had</b> fallen about them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road behind <b>was</b> dim, he <b>had</b> heard again <b>the</b> quick patter <b>of</b> feet. Even now he heard <b>it</b>. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams <b>of</b> light behind, <b>or</b> for a moment he <b>thought</b> he saw them, <b>but</b> at <b>once</b> they slipped aside <b>and</b> vanished.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>? “said <b>the</b> dwarf.
<br>   “<b>I</b> don't know.” answered Frodo. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> heard feet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> saw a light-like eyes. <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> so often, since we first entered Moria.”
<br>   Gimli halted <b>and</b> stooped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. “<b>I</b> hear <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> night-speech <b>of</b> plant <b>and</b> stone,” he said. “Come! Let us hurry! The others are out <b>of</b> sight.”
<br>   The night-wind blew chill up <b>the</b> valley <b>to</b> meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow loomed, <b>and</b> they heard an endless rustle <b>of</b> leaves like poplars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breeze.
<br>   “Lothl?rien! “cried Legolas. “Lothl?rien! We have come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Golden Wood. Alas that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> winter!”
<br>   Under <b>the</b> night <b>the</b> trees stood tall before them, arched over <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In <b>the</b> dim light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars their stems were grey, <b>and</b> their quivering leaves a hint <b>of</b> fallow gold.
<br>   “Lothl?rien! “said Aragorn. “Glad <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> hear again <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees! We are still little more than five leagues from <b>the</b> Gates, <b>but</b> we can go <b>no</b> further. Here let us hope that <b>the</b> virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves will keep us tonight from <b>the</b> peril that comes behind.”
<br>   “If Elves indeed still dwell here <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkening world,” said Gimli.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> long since any <b>of</b> my own folk journeyed hither back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land whence we wandered <b>in</b> ages long ago,” said Legolas, “<b>but</b> we hear that L?rien <b>is</b> not yet deserted, for there <b>is</b> a secret power here that holds evil from <b>the</b> land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, <b>and</b> maybe they dwell now deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods <b>and</b> far from <b>the</b> northern border.”
<br>   “Indeed deep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood they dwell,” said Aragorn, <b>and</b> sighed as if some memory stirred <b>in</b> him. “We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go forward a short way, until <b>the</b> trees are all about us, <b>and</b> then we will turn aside from <b>the</b> path <b>and</b> seek a place <b>to</b> rest <b>in</b>.”
<br>   He stepped forward; <b>but</b> Boromir stood irresolute <b>and</b> did not follow. “Is there <b>no</b> other way? “he said.
<br>   “What other fairer way would you desire? “said Aragorn.
<br>   “A plain road, though <b>it</b> led through a hedge <b>of</b> swords,” said Boromir. “By strange paths has this Company been led, <b>and</b> so far <b>to</b> evil fortune. Against my will we passed under <b>the</b> shades <b>of</b> Moria, <b>to</b> our loss. And now we must enter <b>the</b> Golden Wood, you say. But <b>of</b> that perilous land we have heard <b>in</b> Gondor, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said that few come out who <b>once</b> go <b>in</b>; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> that few none have escaped unscathed.”
<br>   “Say not unscathed, <b>but</b> if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak <b>the</b> truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes <b>in</b> Gondor, Boromir, if <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> those who <b>once</b> were wise they now speak evil <b>of</b> Lothl?rien. Believe <b>what</b> you will, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other way for us—unless you would go back <b>to</b> Moria-gate, <b>or</b> scale <b>the</b> pathless mountains, <b>or</b> swim <b>the</b> Great River all alone.”
<br>   “Then lead <b>on</b>! “said Boromir. “But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perilous.”
<br>   “Perilous indeed,” said Aragorn, “fair <b>and</b> perilous; <b>but</b> only evil need fear <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!”
<br>   They <b>had</b> gone little more than a mile <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from <b>the</b> tree-clad slopes that climbed back westward towards <b>the</b> mountains. They heard <b>it</b> splashing over a fall away among <b>the</b> shadows <b>on</b> their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across <b>the</b> path before them, <b>and</b> joined <b>the</b> Silverlode <b>in</b> a swirl <b>of</b> dim pools among <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees.
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> Nimrodel! “said Legolas. “Of this stream <b>the</b> Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, <b>and</b> still we sing them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North, remembering <b>the</b> rainbow <b>on</b> its falls, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> golden flowers that floated <b>in</b> its foam. All <b>is</b> dark now <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bridge <b>of</b> Nimrodel <b>is</b> broken down. <b>I</b> will bathe my feet, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said that <b>the</b> water <b>is</b> healing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> weary.” He went forward <b>and</b> climbed down <b>the</b> deep-cloven <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream.
<br>   “Follow me!” he cried. “The water <b>is</b> not deep. Let us wade across! On <b>the</b> further <b>bank</b> we can rest. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falling water may bring us sleep <b>and</b> forgetfulness <b>of</b> grief.”
<br>   One <b>by</b> one they climbed down <b>and</b> followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near <b>the</b> brink <b>and</b> let <b>the</b> water flow over his <b>tired</b> feet. It <b>was</b> cold <b>but</b> its touch <b>was</b> clean, <b>and</b> as he went <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> mounted <b>to</b> his knees, he felt that <b>the</b> stain <b>of</b> travel <b>and</b> all weariness <b>was</b> washed from his limbs.
<br>   When all <b>the</b> Company <b>had</b> crossed, they sat <b>and</b> rested <b>and</b> ate a little food; <b>and</b> Legolas told them tales <b>of</b> Lothl?rien that <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Mirkwood still kept <b>in</b> their hearts, <b>of</b> sunlight <b>and</b> starlight upon <b>the</b> meadows <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Great River before <b>the</b> world <b>was</b> grey.
<br>   At length a silence fell, <b>and</b> they heard <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waterfall running sweetly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing, mingled with <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “Do you hear <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Nimrodel? “asked Legolas. “<b>I</b> will sing you a song <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maiden Nimrodel, who bore <b>the</b> same name as <b>the</b> stream beside which <b>she</b> lived lung ago. It <b>is</b> a fair song <b>in</b> our woodland tongue; <b>but</b> this <b>is</b> how <b>it</b> runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Westron Speech, as some <b>in</b> Rivendell now sing <b>it</b>.” In a soft voice hardly <b>to</b> be heard amid <b>the</b> rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves above them he began:
<br>   
<br>An Elven-maid there <b>was</b> <b>of</b> old,
<br>A shining star <b>by</b> day:
<br>Her mantle white <b>was</b> hemmed with gold,
<br>Her shoes <b>of</b> silver-grey.
<br>
<br>A star <b>was</b> bound upon <b>her</b> brows,
<br>A light <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hair
<br>As sun upon <b>the</b> golden boughs
<br>In L?rien <b>the</b> fair.
<br>
<br>Her hair <b>was</b> long, <b>her</b> limbs were white,
<br>And fair <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> free;
<br>And <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>she</b> went as light
<br>As leaf <b>of</b> linden-tree.
<br>
<br>Beside <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel,
<br>By water clear <b>and</b> cool,
<br>Her voice as falling silver fell
<br>Into <b>the</b> shining pool.
<br>
<br>Where now <b>she</b> wanders none can tell,
<br>In sunlight <b>or</b> <b>in</b> shade;
<br>For lost <b>of</b> yore <b>was</b> Nimrodel
<br>And <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains strayed.
<br>
<br>The elven-ship <b>in</b> haven grey
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> mountain-lee
<br>Awaited <b>her</b> for many a day
<br>Beside <b>the</b> roaring sea.
<br>
<br>A wind <b>by</b> night <b>in</b> Northern lands
<br>Arose, <b>and</b> loud <b>it</b> cried,
<br>And drove <b>the</b> ship from elven-strands
<br>Across <b>the</b> streaming tide.
<br>
<br>When dawn came dim <b>the</b> land <b>was</b> lost,
<br>The mountains sinking grey
<br>Beyond <b>the</b> heaving waves that tossed
<br>Their plumes <b>of</b> blinding spray.
<br>
<br>Amroth beheld <b>the</b> fading shore
<br>Now low beyond <b>the</b> swell,
<br>And cursed <b>the</b> faithless ship that bore
<br>Him far from Nimrodel.
<br>
<br>Of old he <b>was</b> an Elven-king,
<br>A lord <b>of</b> tree <b>and</b> glen,
<br>When golden were <b>the</b> boughs <b>in</b> spring
<br>In fair Lothl?rien.
<br>
<br>From helm <b>to</b> sea they saw him leap,
<br>As arrow from <b>the</b> string,
<br>And dive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water deep,
<br>As mew upon <b>the</b> wing.
<br>
<br>The wind <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his flowing hair,
<br>The foam about him shone;
<br>Afar they saw him strong <b>and</b> fair
<br>Go riding like a swan.
<br>
<br>But from <b>the</b> West has come <b>no</b> word,
<br>And <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hither Shore
<br>No tidings Elven-folk have heard
<br>Of Amroth evermore.
<br>   
<br>   The voice <b>of</b> Legolas faltered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song ceased. “<b>I</b> cannot sing any more,” he said. “That <b>is</b> <b>but</b> a part, for <b>I</b> have forgotten much. It <b>is</b> long <b>and</b> sad, for <b>it</b> tells how sorrow came upon Lothl?rien, L?rien <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blossom, when <b>the</b> Dwarves awakened evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Dwarves did not make <b>the</b> evil,” said Gimli.
<br>   “<b>I</b> said not so; yet evil came,” answered Legolas sadly. “Then many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings <b>and</b> departed <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> lost far <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> came not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship where Amroth <b>her</b> lover waited for <b>her</b>. But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring when <b>the</b> wind <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new leaves <b>the</b> echo <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice may still be heard <b>by</b> <b>the</b> falls that bear <b>her</b> name. And when <b>the</b> wind <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> Amroth comes up from <b>the</b> sea; for Nimrodel flows <b>into</b> Silverlode, that Elves call Celebrant, <b>and</b> Celebrant <b>into</b> Anduin <b>the</b> Great. <b>and</b> Anduin flows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Belfalas whence <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien set sail. But neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back.
<br>   “It <b>is</b> told that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a house built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> a tree that grew near <b>the</b> falls; for that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> custom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien, <b>to</b> dwell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> maybe <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so still. Therefore they were called <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>the</b> Tree-people. Deep <b>in</b> their forest <b>the</b> trees are <b>very</b> great. The people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woods did not delve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground like Dwarves, nor build strong places <b>of</b> stone before <b>the</b> Shadow came.”
<br>   “And even <b>in</b> these latter days dwelling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees might be <b>thought</b> safer than <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground,” said Gimli. He looked across <b>the</b> stream <b>to</b> <b>the</b> road that led back <b>to</b> Dimrill Dale, <b>and</b> then up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> dark boughs above.
<br>   “Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,” said Aragorn. “We cannot build a house, <b>but</b> tonight we will <b>do</b> as <b>the</b> Galadhrim <b>and</b> seek refuge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside <b>the</b> road already longer than <b>was</b> wise.”
<br>   The Company now turned aside from <b>the</b> path, <b>and</b> went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeper woods, westward along <b>the</b> mountain-stream away from Silverlode. Not far from <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel they found a cluster <b>of</b> trees, some <b>of</b> which overhung <b>the</b> stream. Their great grey trunks were <b>of</b> mighty girth, <b>but</b> their height could not be guessed.
<br>   “<b>I</b> will climb up,” said Legolas. “<b>I</b> am at home among trees, <b>by</b> root <b>or</b> bough, though these trees are <b>of</b> a kind strange <b>to</b> me, save as a name <b>in</b> song. Mellyrn they are called, <b>and</b> are those that bear <b>the</b> yellow blossom, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have never climbed <b>in</b> one. <b>I</b> will see now <b>what</b> <b>is</b> their shape <b>and</b> way <b>of</b> growth.”
<br>   “Whatever <b>it</b> may be,” said Pippin, “they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except <b>to</b> birds. <b>I</b> cannot sleep <b>on</b> a perch!”
<br>   “Then dig a hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground,” said Legolas, “if that <b>is</b> more after <b>the</b> fashion <b>of</b> your kind. But you must dig swift <b>and</b> deep, if you wish <b>to</b> hide from Orcs.” He sprang lightly up from <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> caught a branch that grew from <b>the</b> trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from <b>the</b> tree-shadows above him.
<br>   “Daro!” <b>it</b> said <b>in</b> commanding tone, <b>and</b> Legolas dropped back <b>to</b> earth <b>in</b> surprise <b>and</b> fear. He shrank against <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree.
<br>   “Stand still! “he whispered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others. “Do not move <b>or</b> speak!”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a sound <b>of</b> soft laughter over their heads, <b>and</b> then another clear voice spoke <b>in</b> an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said, for <b>the</b> speech that <b>the</b> Silvan folk east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains used among themselves <b>was</b> unlike that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. Legolas looked up <b>and</b> answered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same language.*
<br>   “Who are they, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> they say? “asked Merry.
<br>   “They're Elves,” said Sam. “Can't you hear their voices?”
<br>   “Yes, they are Elves,” said Legolas; “<b>and</b> they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark.” Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth. “But they say also that you need have <b>no</b> fear. They have been aware <b>of</b> us for a long while. They heard my voice across <b>the</b> Nimrodel, <b>and</b> knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> one <b>of</b> their Northern kindred, <b>and</b> therefore they did not hinder our crossing; <b>and</b> afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem <b>to</b> have <b>had</b> some tidings <b>of</b> him <b>and</b> <b>of</b> our journey. The others they ask <b>to</b> wait a little <b>and</b> <b>to</b> keep watch at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, until they have decided <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be done.”
<br>   Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadows a ladder <b>was</b> let down: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made <b>of</b> rope, silver-grey <b>and</b> glimmering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>and</b> though <b>it</b> looked slender <b>it</b> proved strong enough <b>to</b> bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, <b>and</b> Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not <b>to</b> breathe loudly. The branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from <b>the</b> trunk, <b>and</b> then swept upward; <b>but</b> near <b>the</b> top <b>the</b> main stem divided <b>into</b> a crown <b>of</b> many boughs, <b>and</b> among these they found that there <b>had</b> been built a wooden platform, <b>or</b> flet as such things were called <b>in</b> those days: <b>the</b> Elves called <b>it</b> a talan. It <b>was</b> reached <b>by</b> a round hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre through which <b>the</b> ladder passed.
<br>   When Frodo came at last up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They were clad <b>in</b> shadowy-grey, <b>and</b> could not be seen among <b>the</b> tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, <b>and</b> one <b>of</b> them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held <b>it</b> up, looking at Frodo's face, <b>and</b> Sam's. Then he shut off <b>the</b> light again, <b>and</b> spoke words <b>of</b> welcome <b>in</b> his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly <b>in</b> return.
<br>   “Welcome!” <b>the</b> Elf then said again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Common Language, speaking slowly. “We seldom <b>use</b> any tongue <b>but</b> our own; for we dwell now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even our own kindred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North are sundered from us. But there are some <b>of</b> us still who go abroad for <b>the</b> gathering <b>of</b> news <b>and</b> <b>the</b> watching <b>of</b> our enemies, <b>and</b> they speak <b>the</b> languages <b>of</b> other lands. <b>I</b> am one. Haldir <b>is</b> my name. My brothers, R?mil <b>and</b> Orophin, speak little <b>of</b> your tongue.
<br>   “But we have heard rumours <b>of</b> your coming, for <b>the</b> messengers <b>of</b> Elrond passed <b>by</b> L?rien <b>on</b> their way home up <b>the</b> Dimrill Stair. We <b>had</b> not heard <b>of</b> hobbits, <b>or</b> halflings, for many a long year, <b>and</b> did not know that any yet dwelt <b>in</b> Middle-earth. You <b>do</b> not look evil! And since you come with an Elf <b>of</b> our kindred, we are willing <b>to</b> befriend you, as Elrond asked; though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not our custom <b>to</b> lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight. How many are you?”
<br>   “Eight,” said Legolas. “Myself, four hobbits; <b>and</b> two men, one <b>of</b> whom, Aragorn, <b>is</b> an Elf-friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> folk <b>of</b> Westernesse.”
<br>   “The name <b>of</b> Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn <b>is</b> known <b>in</b> L?rien,” said Haldir, “<b>and</b> he has <b>the</b> favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady. All then <b>is</b> well. But you have yet spoken only <b>of</b> seven.”
<br>   “The eighth <b>is</b> a dwarf,” said Legolas.
<br>   “A dwarf! “said Haldir. “That <b>is</b> not well. We have not <b>had</b> dealings with <b>the</b> Dwarves since <b>the</b> Dark Days. They are not permitted <b>in</b> our land. <b>I</b> cannot allow him <b>to</b> pass.”
<br>   “But he <b>is</b> from <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain, one <b>of</b> D?<b>in</b>'s trusty people, <b>and</b> friendly <b>to</b> Elrond,” said Frodo. “Elrond himself chose him <b>to</b> be one <b>of</b> our companions, <b>and</b> he has been brave <b>and</b> faithful.”
<br>   The Elves spoke together <b>in</b> soft voices, <b>and</b> questioned Legolas <b>in</b> their own tongue. “Very good,” said Haldir at last. “We will <b>do</b> this, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> against our liking. If Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas will guard him, <b>and</b> answer for him, he shall pass; <b>but</b> he must go blindfold through Lothl?rien.
<br>   “But now we must debate <b>no</b> longer. Your folk must not remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. We have been keeping watch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rivers, ever since we saw a great troop <b>of</b> Orcs going north toward Moria, along <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains, many days ago. Wolves are howling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood's borders. If you have indeed come from Moria, <b>the</b> peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go <b>on</b>.
<br>   “The four hobbits shall climb up here <b>and</b> stay with us-we <b>do</b> not fear them! There <b>is</b> another talan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next tree. There <b>the</b> others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer <b>to</b> us for them. Call us, if anything <b>is</b> amiss! And have an eye <b>on</b> that dwarf!”
<br>   Legolas at <b>once</b> went down <b>the</b> ladder <b>to</b> take Haldir's message; <b>and</b> soon afterwards Merry <b>and</b> Pippin clambered up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high flet. They were out <b>of</b> breath <b>and</b> seemed rather scared.
<br>   “There!” said Merry panting. “We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own. Strider has hidden all <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baggage <b>in</b> a deep drift <b>of</b> leaves.”
<br>   “You <b>had</b> <b>no</b> need <b>of</b> your burdens,” said Haldir. “It <b>is</b> cold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree-tops <b>in</b> winter, though <b>the</b> wind tonight <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South; <b>but</b> we have food <b>and</b> drink <b>to</b> give you that will drive away <b>the</b> night-chill, <b>and</b> we have skins <b>and</b> cloaks <b>to</b> spare.”
<br>   The hobbits accepted this second (<b>and</b> far better) supper <b>very</b> gladly. Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fur-cloaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> their own blankets as well, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found that easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b>. Hobbits <b>do</b> not like heights, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet <b>was</b> not at all <b>to</b> their liking as a bedroom. It <b>had</b> <b>no</b> walls. not even a rail; only <b>on</b> one side <b>was</b> there a light plaited screen, which could be moved <b>and</b> fixed <b>in</b> different places according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   Pippin went <b>on</b> talking for a while. “<b>I</b> hope, if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> go <b>to</b> sleep <b>in</b> this bed-loft, that <b>I</b> shan't roll off,” he said.
<br>   “Once <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> sleep,” said Sam, “i shall go <b>on</b> sleeping, whether <b>I</b> roll off <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. And <b>the</b> less said, <b>the</b> sooner <b>I</b>'ll drop off, if you take my meaning.”
<br>   Frodo lay for some time awake, <b>and</b> looked up at <b>the</b> stars glinting through <b>the</b> pale roof <b>of</b> quivering leaves. Sam <b>was</b> snoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see <b>the</b> grey forms <b>of</b> two elves <b>sitting</b> motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking <b>in</b> whispers. The other <b>had</b> gone down <b>to</b> take up his watch <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower branches. At last lulled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boughs above, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sweet murmur <b>of</b> <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> Legolas running <b>in</b> his mind.
<br>   Late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves were gone. The sickle Moon <b>was</b> gleaming dimly among <b>the</b> leaves. The wind <b>was</b> still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tread <b>of</b> many feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground below. There <b>was</b> a ring <b>of</b> metal. The sounds died slowly away, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> go southward, <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood.
<br>   A head appeared suddenly through <b>the</b> hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flet. Frodo sat up <b>in</b> alarm <b>and</b> saw that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards <b>the</b> hobbits.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>? “said Frodo.
<br>   “Yrch!” said <b>the</b> Elf <b>in</b> a hissing whisper, <b>and</b> cast <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet <b>the</b> rope-ladder rolled up.
<br>   “Orcs! “said Frodo. “What are they doing? “But <b>the</b> Elf <b>had</b> gone.
<br>   There were <b>no</b> more sounds. Even <b>the</b> leaves were silent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> falls seemed <b>to</b> be hushed. Frodo sat <b>and</b> shivered <b>in</b> his wraps. He <b>was</b> thankful that they <b>had</b> not been caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground; <b>but</b> he felt that <b>the</b> trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds <b>on</b> a scent, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said, <b>but</b> they could also climb. He drew out Sting: <b>it</b> flashed <b>and</b> glittered like a blue flame <b>and</b> then slowly faded again <b>and</b> grew dull. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fading <b>of</b> his sword <b>the</b> feeling <b>of</b> immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather <b>it</b> grew stronger. He got up <b>and</b> crawled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opening <b>and</b> peered down. He <b>was</b> almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at <b>the</b> tree's foot far below.
<br>   Not Elves; for <b>the</b> woodland folk were altogether noiseless <b>in</b> their movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: <b>and</b> something seemed <b>to</b> be scrabbling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bark <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree-trunk. He stared down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark, holding his breath.
<br>   Something <b>was</b> now climbing slowly, <b>and</b> its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped <b>and</b> gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, <b>and</b> a shadowy figure slipped round <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> vanished.
<br>   Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through <b>the</b> branches. “There <b>was</b> something <b>in</b> this tree that <b>I</b> have never seen before,” he said. “It <b>was</b> not an orc. It fled as soon as <b>I</b> touched <b>the</b> tree-stem. It seemed <b>to</b> be wary, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have some skill <b>in</b> trees, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> might have <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one <b>of</b> you hobbits.
<br>   “<b>I</b> did not shoot, for <b>I</b> dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle. A strong company <b>of</b> Orcs has passed. They crossed <b>the</b> Nimrodel-curse their foul feet <b>in</b> its clean water!-<b>and</b> went <b>on</b> down <b>the</b> old road beside <b>the</b> river. They seemed <b>to</b> pick up some scent, <b>and</b> they searched <b>the</b> ground for a while near <b>the</b> place where you halted. The three <b>of</b> us could not challenge a hundred, so we went ahead <b>and</b> spoke with feigned voices, leading them <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood.
<br>   “Orophin has now gone <b>in</b> haste back <b>to</b> our dwellings <b>to</b> warn our people. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcs will ever return out <b>of</b> L?rien. And there will be many Elves hidden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northern border before another night falls. But you must take <b>the</b> road south as soon as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fully light.”
<br>   Day came pale from <b>the</b> East. As <b>the</b> light grew <b>it</b> filtered through <b>the</b> yellow leaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mallorn, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits that <b>the</b> early sun <b>of</b> a cool summer's morning <b>was</b> shining. Pale-blue sky <b>peeped</b> among <b>the</b> moving branches. Looking through an opening <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flet Frodo saw all <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode lying like a sea <b>of</b> fallow gold tossing gently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> breeze.
<br>   The morning <b>was</b> still young <b>and</b> cold when <b>the</b> Company set out again, guided now <b>by</b> Haldir <b>and</b> his brother R?mil. “Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! “cried Legolas. Frodo looked back <b>and</b> caught a gleam <b>of</b> white foam among <b>the</b> grey tree-stems. “Farewell,” he said. It seemed <b>to</b> him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes <b>in</b> an endless changeful music.
<br>   They went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> path that still went <b>on</b> along <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, <b>and</b> for some way they followed <b>it</b> southward. There were <b>the</b> prints <b>of</b> orc-feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth. But soon Haldir turned aside <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> halted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river under their shadows.
<br>   “There <b>is</b> one <b>of</b> my people yonder across <b>the</b> stream,” he said “though you may not see him.” He gave a call like <b>the</b> low whistle <b>of</b> a bird, <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> a thicket <b>of</b> young trees an Elf stepped, clad <b>in</b> grey, <b>but</b> with his hood thrown back; his hair glinted like gold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over <b>the</b> stream a coil <b>of</b> grey rope, <b>and</b> he caught <b>it</b> <b>and</b> bound <b>the</b> end about a tree near <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>.
<br>   “Celebrant <b>is</b> already a strong stream here, as you see,” said Haldir “<b>and</b> <b>it</b> runs both swift <b>and</b> deep, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> cold. We <b>do</b> not set foot <b>in</b> <b>it</b> so far north, unless we must. But <b>in</b> these days <b>of</b> watchfulness we <b>do</b> not make bridges. This <b>is</b> how we cross! Follow me!” He made his end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rope fast about another tree, <b>and</b> then ran lightly along <b>it</b>, over <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> back again, as if he were <b>on</b> a road.
<br>   “<b>I</b> can walk this path,” said Legolas; “<b>but</b> <b>the</b> others have not this skill. Must they swim?”
<br>   “No!” said Haldir. “We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above <b>the</b> other, one shoulder-high, <b>and</b> another half-high, <b>and</b> holding these <b>the</b> strangers should be able <b>to</b> cross with care.”
<br>   When this slender bridge <b>had</b> been made, <b>the</b> Company passed over, some cautiously <b>and</b> slowly, others more easily. Of <b>the</b> hobbits Pippin proved <b>the</b> best for he <b>was</b> sure-footed, <b>and</b> he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; <b>but</b> he kept his eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> ahead <b>and</b> did not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, <b>and</b> looking down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale eddying water as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a chasm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains.
<br>   He breathed with relief when he <b>was</b> safely across. “Live <b>and</b> learn! as my gaffer used <b>to</b> say. Though he <b>was</b> thinking <b>of</b> gardening, not <b>of</b> roosting like a bird, nor <b>of</b> trying <b>to</b> walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!”
<br>   When at length all <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, <b>the</b> Elves untied <b>the</b> ropes <b>and</b> coiled two <b>of</b> them. R?mil, who <b>had</b> remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, drew back <b>the</b> last one, slung <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder, <b>and</b> with a wave <b>of</b> his hand went away, back <b>to</b> Nimrodel <b>to</b> keep watch.
<br>   “Now, friends,” said Haldir, “you have entered <b>the</b> Naith <b>of</b> L?rien <b>or</b> <b>the</b> Gore, as you would say, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> land that lies like a spear-head between <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> Silverlode <b>and</b> Anduin <b>the</b> Great. We allow <b>no</b> strangers <b>to</b> spy out <b>the</b> secrets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naith. Few indeed are permitted even <b>to</b> set foot there.
<br>   “As <b>was</b> agreed, <b>I</b> shall here blindfold <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> Gimli <b>the</b> Dwarf. The other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer <b>to</b> our dwellings, down <b>in</b> Egladil, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Angle between <b>the</b> waters.”
<br>   This <b>was</b> not at all <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liking <b>of</b> Gimli. “The agreement <b>was</b> made <b>without</b> my consent,” he said. “<b>I</b> will not walk blindfold, like a beggar <b>or</b> a prisoner. And <b>I</b> am <b>no</b> spy. My folk have never <b>had</b> dealings with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> servants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Neither have we done harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Elves. <b>I</b> am <b>no</b> more likely <b>to</b> betray you than Legolas, <b>or</b> any other <b>of</b> my companions.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt you,” said Haldir. “Yet this <b>is</b> our law. <b>I</b> am not <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, <b>and</b> cannot set <b>it</b> aside. <b>I</b> have done much <b>in</b> letting you set foot over Celebrant.”
<br>   Gimli <b>was</b> obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, <b>and</b> laid his hand upon <b>the</b> haft <b>of</b> his axe. “<b>I</b> will go forward free,” he said, “<b>or</b> <b>I</b> will go back <b>and</b> seek my own land, where <b>I</b> am known <b>to</b> be true <b>of</b> word, though <b>I</b> perish alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness.”
<br>   “You cannot go back,” said Haldir sternly. “Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady. They shall judge you, <b>to</b> hold you <b>or</b> <b>to</b> give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross <b>the</b> rivers again, <b>and</b> behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.”
<br>   Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir <b>and</b> his companion bent their bows. “A plague <b>on</b> Dwarves <b>and</b> their stiff necks! “said Legolas.
<br>   “Come!” said Aragorn. “If <b>I</b> am still <b>to</b> lead this Company, you must <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> bid. It <b>is</b> hard upon <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>to</b> be thus singled out. We will all be blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though <b>it</b> will make <b>the</b> journey slow <b>and</b> dull.”
<br>   Gimli laughed suddenly. “A merry troop <b>of</b> fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all <b>on</b> a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But <b>I</b> will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am an Elf <b>and</b> a kinsman here,” said Legolas, becoming angry <b>in</b> his turn.
<br>   “Now let us cry: “a plague <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stiff necks <b>of</b> Elves!” said Aragorn. “But <b>the</b> Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> shall claim full amends for every fall <b>and</b> stubbed toe, if you <b>do</b> not lead us well,” said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.
<br>   “You will have <b>no</b> claim,” said Haldir. “<b>I</b> shall lead you well, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> paths are smooth <b>and</b> straight.”
<br>   “Alas for <b>the</b> folly <b>of</b> these days! “said Legolas. “Here all are enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one Enemy, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> must walk blind, while <b>the</b> sun <b>is</b> merry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woodland under leaves <b>of</b> gold!”
<br>   “Folly <b>it</b> may seem,” said Haldir. “Indeed <b>in</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord more clearly shown than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> estrangement that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith <b>and</b> trust <b>do</b> we find now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world beyond Lothl?rien, unless maybe <b>in</b> Rivendell, that we dare not <b>by</b> our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many perils, <b>and</b> our hands are more often upon <b>the</b> bowstring than upon <b>the</b> harp.
<br>   “The rivers long defended us, <b>but</b> they are a sure guard <b>no</b> more for <b>the</b> Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak <b>of</b> departing, yet for that <b>it</b> already seems too late. The mountains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west are growing evil; <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> lands are waste, <b>and</b> full <b>of</b> Sauron's creatures; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mouths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River are watched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Even if we could come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, we should find <b>no</b> longer any shelter there. It <b>is</b> said that there are still havens <b>of</b>. <b>the</b> High Elves, <b>but</b> they are far north <b>and</b> west, beyond <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Halflings. But where that may be, though <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady may know, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not.”
<br>   “You ought at least <b>to</b> guess, since you have seen us,” said Merry. “There are Elf-havens west <b>of</b> my land, <b>the</b> Shire where Hobbits live.”
<br>   “Happy folk are Hobbits <b>to</b> dwell near <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea! “said Haldir. “It <b>is</b> long indeed since any <b>of</b> my folk have looked <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, yet still we remember <b>it</b> <b>in</b> song. Tell me <b>of</b> these havens as we walk.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> cannot,” said Merry. “<b>I</b> have never seen them. <b>I</b> have never been out <b>of</b> my own land before. And if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> known <b>what</b> <b>the</b> world outside <b>was</b> like. <b>I</b> don't think <b>I</b> should have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Not even <b>to</b> see fair Lothl?rien? “said Haldir. “The world <b>is</b> indeed full <b>of</b> peril, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> there are many dark places; <b>but</b> still there <b>is</b> much that <b>is</b> fair, <b>and</b> though <b>in</b> all lands love <b>is</b> now mingled with grief, <b>it</b> grows perhaps <b>the</b> greater.
<br>   “Some there are among us who sing that <b>the</b> Shadow will draw back <b>and</b> peace shall come again. Yet <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that <b>the</b> world about us will ever again be as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>of</b> old, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> aforetime. For <b>the</b> Elves, <b>I</b> fear, <b>it</b> will prove at best a truce, <b>in</b> which they may pass <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sea unhindered <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> Middle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothl?rien that <b>I</b> love! It would be a poor life <b>in</b> a land where <b>no</b> mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond <b>the</b> Great Sea, none have reported <b>it</b>.”
<br>   As they spoke thus, <b>the</b> Company filed slowly along <b>the</b> paths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood, led <b>by</b> Haldir, while <b>the</b> other Elf walked behind. They felt <b>the</b> ground beneath their feet smooth <b>and</b> soft, <b>and</b> after a while they walked more freely, <b>without</b> fear <b>of</b> hurt <b>or</b> fall. Being deprived <b>of</b> sight, Frodo found his hearing <b>and</b> other senses sharpened. He could smell <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trodden grass. He could hear many different notes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves overhead, <b>the</b> river murmuring away <b>on</b> his right, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> thin clear voices <b>of</b> birds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky. He felt <b>the</b> sun upon his face <b>and</b> hands when they passed through an open glade.
<br>   As soon as he set foot upon <b>the</b> far <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> Silverlode a strange feeling <b>had</b> come upon him, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> deepened as he walked <b>on</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Naith: <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he <b>had</b> stepped over a bridge <b>of</b> time <b>into</b> a corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> -now walking <b>in</b> a world that <b>was</b> <b>no</b> more. In Rivendell there <b>was</b> memory <b>of</b> ancient things; <b>in</b> L?rien <b>the</b> ancient things still lived <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waking world. Evil <b>had</b> been seen <b>and</b> heard there, sorrow <b>had</b> been known; <b>the</b> Elves feared <b>and</b> distrusted <b>the</b> world outside: wolves were howling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood's borders: <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien <b>no</b> shadow lay.
<br>   All that day <b>the</b> Company marched <b>on</b>, until they felt <b>the</b> cool evening come <b>and</b> heard <b>the</b> early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then they rested <b>and</b> slept <b>without</b> fear upon <b>the</b> ground; for their guides would not permit them <b>to</b> unbind their eyes, <b>and</b> they could not climb. In <b>the</b> morning they went <b>on</b> again, walking <b>without</b> haste. At noon they halted, <b>and</b> Frodo <b>was</b> aware that they <b>had</b> passed out under <b>the</b> shining Sun. Suddenly he heard <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> many voices all around him.
<br>   A marching host <b>of</b> Elves <b>had</b> come up silently: they were hastening toward <b>the</b> northern borders <b>to</b> guard against any attack from Moria; <b>and</b> they brought news, some <b>of</b> which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs <b>had</b> been waylaid <b>and</b> almost all destroyed; <b>the</b> remnant <b>had</b> fled westward towards <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> were being pursued. A strange creature also <b>had</b> been seen, running with bent back <b>and</b> with hands near <b>the</b> ground, like a beast <b>and</b> yet not <b>of</b> beast-shape. It <b>had</b> eluded capture, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> not shot <b>it</b>, not knowing whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good <b>or</b> ill, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> vanished down <b>the</b> Silverlode southward.
<br>   “Also,” said Haldir, “they bring me a message from <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim. You are all <b>to</b> walk free, even <b>the</b> dwarf Gimli. It seems that <b>the</b> Lady knows who <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> each member <b>of</b> your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.”
<br>   He removed <b>the</b> bandage first from Gimli's eyes. “Your pardon! “he said, bowing low. “Look <b>on</b> us now with friendly eyes! Look <b>and</b> be glad, for you are <b>the</b> first dwarf <b>to</b> behold <b>the</b> trees <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naith <b>of</b> L?rien since Durin's Day!”
<br>   When his eyes were <b>in</b> turn uncovered, Frodo looked up <b>and</b> caught his breath. They were standing <b>in</b> an open space. To <b>the</b> left stood a great mound, covered with a sward <b>of</b> grass as green as Spring-time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elder Days. Upon <b>it</b>, as a double crown, grew two circles <b>of</b> trees: <b>the</b> outer <b>had</b> bark <b>of</b> snowy white, <b>and</b> were leafless <b>but</b> beautiful <b>in</b> their shapely nakedness; <b>the</b> inner were mallorn-trees <b>of</b> great height, still arrayed <b>in</b> pale gold. High amid <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> a towering tree that stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> all there gleamed a white flet. At <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees, <b>and</b> all about <b>the</b> green hillsides <b>the</b> grass <b>was</b> studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding <b>on</b> slender stalks, were other flowers, white <b>and</b> palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid <b>the</b> rich hue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grass. Over all <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> blue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun <b>of</b> afternoon glowed upon <b>the</b> hill <b>and</b> cast long green shadows beneath <b>the</b> trees.
<br>   “Behold! You are come <b>to</b> Cerin Amroth,” said Haldir. “For this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient realm as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> long ago, <b>and</b> here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mound <b>of</b> Amroth, where <b>in</b> happier days his high house <b>was</b> built. Here ever bloom <b>the</b> winter flowers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unfading grass: <b>the</b> yellow elanor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pale niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim at dusk.”
<br>   The others cast themselves down upon <b>the</b> fragrant grass, <b>but</b> Frodo stood awhile still lost <b>in</b> wonder. It seemed <b>to</b> him that he <b>had</b> stepped through a high window that looked <b>on</b> a vanished world. A light <b>was</b> upon <b>it</b> for which his language <b>had</b> <b>no</b> name. All that he saw <b>was</b> shapely, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> shapes seemed at <b>once</b> clear cut, as if they <b>had</b> been first conceived <b>and</b> drawn at <b>the</b> uncovering <b>of</b> his eyes, <b>and</b> ancient as if they <b>had</b> endured for ever. He saw <b>no</b> colour <b>but</b> those he knew, gold <b>and</b> white <b>and</b> blue <b>and</b> green, <b>but</b> they were fresh <b>and</b> poignant, as if he <b>had</b> at that moment first perceived them <b>and</b> made for them names new <b>and</b> wonderful. In winter here <b>no</b> heart could mourn for summer <b>or</b> for spring. No blemish <b>or</b> sickness <b>or</b> deformity could be seen <b>in</b> anything that grew upon <b>the</b> earth. On <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> stain.
<br>   He turned <b>and</b> saw that Sam <b>was</b> now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, <b>and</b> rubbing his eyes as if he <b>was</b> not sure that he <b>was</b> awake. “It's sunlight <b>and</b> bright day, right enough,” he said. “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that Elves were all for moon <b>and</b> stars: <b>but</b> this <b>is</b> more elvish than anything <b>I</b> ever heard tell <b>of</b>. <b>I</b> feel as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> inside a song. if you take my meaning.”
<br>   Haldir looked at them, <b>and</b> he seemed indeed <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> both <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> word. He smiled. “You feel <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim,” he said. “Would <b>it</b> please you <b>to</b> climb with me up Cerin Amroth?”
<br>   They followed him as he stepped lightly up <b>the</b> grass-clad slopes. Though he walked <b>and</b> breathed, <b>and</b> about him living leaves <b>and</b> flowers were stirred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a timeless land that did not fade <b>or</b> change <b>or</b> fall <b>into</b> forgetfulness. When he <b>had</b> gone <b>and</b> passed again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer world, still Frodo <b>the</b> wanderer from <b>the</b> Shire would walk there, upon <b>the</b> grass among elanor <b>and</b> niphredil <b>in</b> fair Lothl?rien.
<br>   They entered <b>the</b> circle <b>of</b> white trees. As they did so <b>the</b> South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth <b>and</b> sighed among <b>the</b> branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that <b>had</b> long ago been washed away, <b>and</b> sea-birds crying whose race <b>had</b> perished from <b>the</b> earth.
<br>   Haldir <b>had</b> gone <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>was</b> now climbing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high flet. As Frodo prepared <b>to</b> follow him, he laid his hand upon <b>the</b> tree beside <b>the</b> ladder: never before <b>had</b> he been so suddenly <b>and</b> so keenly aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feel <b>and</b> texture <b>of</b> a tree's skin <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> life within <b>it</b>. He felt a delight <b>in</b> wood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> touch <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, neither as forester nor as carpenter; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> delight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living tree itself.
<br>   As he stepped out at last upon <b>the</b> lofty platform, Haldir took his hand <b>and</b> turned him toward <b>the</b> South. “Look this way first! “he said.
<br>   Frodo looked <b>and</b> saw, still at some distance, a hill <b>of</b> many mighty trees, <b>or</b> a city <b>of</b> green towers: which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> he could not tell. Out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that <b>the</b> power <b>and</b> light came that held all <b>the</b> land <b>in</b> sway. He longed suddenly <b>to</b> fly like a bird <b>to</b> rest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> green city. Then he looked eastward <b>and</b> saw all <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien running down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pale gleam <b>of</b> Anduin, <b>the</b> Great River. He lifted his eyes across <b>the</b> river <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> light went out, <b>and</b> he <b>was</b> back again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world he knew. Beyond <b>the</b> river <b>the</b> land appeared flat <b>and</b> empty, formless <b>and</b> vague, until far away <b>it</b> rose again like a wall, dark <b>and</b> drear. The sun that lay <b>on</b> Lothl?rien <b>had</b> <b>no</b> power <b>to</b> enlighten <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> that distant height.
<br>   “There lies <b>the</b> fastness <b>of</b> Southern Mirkwood,” said Haldir. “It <b>is</b> clad <b>in</b> a forest <b>of</b> dark fir, where <b>the</b> trees strive one against another <b>and</b> their branches rot <b>and</b> wither. In <b>the</b> midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long <b>the</b> hidden Enemy <b>had</b> his dwelling. We fear that now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> inhabited again, <b>and</b> with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over <b>it</b> <b>of</b> late. In this high place you may see <b>the</b> two powers that are opposed one <b>to</b> another; <b>and</b> ever they strive now <b>in</b> <b>thought</b>, <b>but</b> whereas <b>the</b> light perceives <b>the</b> <b>very</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet.” He turned <b>and</b> climbed swiftly down, <b>and</b> they followed him.
<br>   At <b>the</b> hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still <b>and</b> silent as a tree; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> his hand <b>was</b> a small golden bloom <b>of</b> elanor, <b>and</b> a light <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes. He <b>was</b> wrapped <b>in</b> some fair memory: <b>and</b> as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they <b>once</b> <b>had</b> been <b>in</b> this same place. For <b>the</b> grim years were removed from <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> Aragorn, <b>and</b> he seemed clothed <b>in</b> white, a young lord tall <b>and</b> fair; <b>and</b> he spoke words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elvish tongue <b>to</b> one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nam?ri?! he said, <b>and</b> then he drew a breath, <b>and</b> returning out <b>of</b> his <b>thought</b> he looked at Frodo <b>and</b> smiled.
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> Elvendom <b>on</b> earth,” he said, “<b>and</b> here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond <b>the</b> dark roads that we still must tread, you <b>and</b> <b>I</b>. Come with me! “And taking Frodo's hand <b>in</b> his, he left <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Cerin Amroth <b>and</b> came there never again as living man.

<br><b>Chapter</b> 7
<br><b>THE</b> MIRROR OF GALADRIEL
<br>   
<br>   The sun <b>was</b> sinking behind <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows were deepening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods, when they went <b>on</b> again. Their paths now went <b>into</b> thickets where <b>the</b> dusk <b>had</b> already gathered. Night came beneath <b>the</b> trees as they walked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elves uncovered their silver lamps.
<br>   Suddenly they came out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open again <b>and</b> found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked <b>by</b> a few early stars. There <b>was</b> a wide treeless space before them, running <b>in</b> a great circle <b>and</b> bending away <b>on</b> either hand. Beyond <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a deep fosse lost <b>in</b> soft shadow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> grass upon its brink <b>was</b> green, as if <b>it</b> glowed still <b>in</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun that <b>had</b> gone. Upon <b>the</b> further side there rose <b>to</b> a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they <b>had</b> yet seen <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> land. Their height could not be guessed, <b>but</b> they stood up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twilight like living towers. In their, many-tiered branches <b>and</b> amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green <b>and</b> gold <b>and</b> silver. Haldir turned towards <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Welcome <b>to</b> Caras Galadhon! “he said. “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim where dwell <b>the</b> Lord Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> L?rien. But we cannot enter here, for <b>the</b> gates <b>do</b> not look northward. We must go round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way <b>is</b> not short, for <b>the</b> city <b>is</b> great.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a road paved with white stone running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outer brink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fosse. Along this they went westward, with <b>the</b> city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> night deepened more lights sprang forth, until all <b>the</b> hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last <b>to</b> a white bridge, <b>and</b> crossing found <b>the</b> great gates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city: they faced south-west, set between <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> encircling wall that here overlapped, <b>and</b> they were tall <b>and</b> strong, <b>and</b> hung with many lamps.
<br>   Haldir knocked <b>and</b> spoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gates opened soundlessly; <b>but</b> <b>of</b> guards Frodo could see <b>no</b> sign. The travellers passed within, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gates shut behind them. They were <b>in</b> a deep lane between <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, <b>and</b> passing quickly through <b>it</b> they entered <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Trees. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon <b>the</b> paths; <b>but</b> there were many voices, about them, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air above. Far away up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill they could hear <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> singing falling from <b>on</b> high like soft rain upon leaves.
<br>   They went along many paths <b>and</b> climbed many stairs, until they came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high places <b>and</b> saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. It <b>was</b> lit <b>by</b> silver lamps that swung from <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> fell <b>into</b> a basin <b>of</b> silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawn there stood <b>the</b> mightiest <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, <b>and</b> up <b>it</b> towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds <b>of</b> leaves. Beside <b>it</b> a broad white ladder stood, <b>and</b> at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as <b>the</b> travellers approached, <b>and</b> Frodo saw that they were tall <b>and</b> clad <b>in</b> grey mail, <b>and</b> from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.
<br>   “Here dwell Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel,” said Haldir. “It <b>is</b> their wish that you should ascend <b>and</b> speak with them.”
<br>   One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elf-wardens then blew a clear note <b>on</b> a small horn, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> answered three times from far above. “<b>I</b> will go first,” said Haldir. “Let Frodo come next <b>and</b> with him Legolas. The others may follow as they wish. It <b>is</b> a long climb for those that are not accustomed <b>to</b> such stairs, <b>but</b> you may rest upon <b>the</b> way.”
<br>   As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some <b>on</b> one side, some <b>on</b> another, <b>and</b> some set about <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree, so that <b>the</b> ladder passed through them. At a great height above <b>the</b> ground he came <b>to</b> a wide talan, like <b>the</b> deck <b>of</b> a great ship. On <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built a house, so large that almost <b>it</b> would have served for a hall <b>of</b> Men upon <b>the</b> earth. He entered behind Haldir, <b>and</b> found that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a chamber <b>of</b> oval shape, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> which grew <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, <b>and</b> yet making still a pillar <b>of</b> wide girth.
<br>   The chamber <b>was</b> filled with a soft light; its walls were green <b>and</b> silver <b>and</b> its roof <b>of</b> gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs beneath <b>the</b> bole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tree <b>and</b> canopied <b>by</b> a living bough there sat, side <b>by</b> side, Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel. They stood up <b>to</b> greet their guests, after <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>no</b> less tall than <b>the</b> Lord; <b>and</b> they were grave <b>and</b> beautiful. They were clad wholly <b>in</b> white; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>was</b> <b>of</b> deep gold, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord Celeborn <b>was</b> <b>of</b> silver long <b>and</b> bright; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> age <b>was</b> upon them, unless <b>it</b> were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> depths <b>of</b> their eyes; for these were keen as lances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starlight, <b>and</b> yet profound, <b>the</b> wells <b>of</b> deep memory.
<br>   Haldir led Frodo before them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lord welcomed him <b>in</b> his own tongue. The Lady Galadriel said <b>no</b> word <b>but</b> looked long upon his face.
<br>   “Sit now beside my chair, Frodo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shire! “said Celeborn. “When all have come we will speak together.”
<br>   Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> companions he greeted courteously <b>by</b> name as they entered. “Welcome Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn! “he said. “It <b>is</b> eight <b>and</b> thirty years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world outside since you came <b>to</b> this land; <b>and</b> those years lie heavy <b>on</b> you. But <b>the</b> end <b>is</b> near, for good <b>or</b> ill. Here lay aside your burden for a while!”
<br>   “Welcome son <b>of</b> Thranduil! Too seldom <b>do</b> my kindred journey hither from <b>the</b> North.”
<br>   “Welcome Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>! It <b>is</b> long indeed since we saw one <b>of</b> Durin's folk <b>in</b> Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May <b>it</b> be a sign that though <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> now dark better days are at hand, <b>and</b> that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.” Gimli bowed low.
<br>   When all <b>the</b> guests were seated before his chair <b>the</b> Lord looked at them again. “Here there are eight,” he said. “Nine were <b>to</b> set out: so said <b>the</b> messages. But maybe there has been some change <b>of</b> counsel that we have not heard. Elrond <b>is</b> far away, <b>and</b> darkness gathers between us, <b>and</b> all this year <b>the</b> shadows have grown longer.”
<br>   “Nay, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> change <b>of</b> counsel,” said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel speaking for <b>the</b> first time. Her voice <b>was</b> clear <b>and</b> musical, <b>but</b> deeper than woman's wont. “Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey set out with <b>the</b> Company, <b>but</b> he did not pass <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> this land. Now tell us where he <b>is</b>; for <b>I</b> much desired <b>to</b> speak with him again. But <b>I</b> cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> Lothl?rien: a grey mist <b>is</b> about him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> his feet <b>and</b> <b>of</b> his mind are hidden from me.”
<br>   “Alas! “said Aragorn. “Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey fell <b>into</b> shadow. He remained <b>in</b> Moria <b>and</b> did not escape.”
<br>   At these words all <b>the</b> Elves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hall cried aloud <b>in</b> grief <b>and</b> amazement. “These are evil tidings,” said Celeborn, “<b>the</b> most evil that have been spoken here <b>in</b> long years full <b>of</b> grievous deeds.” He turned <b>to</b> Haldir. “Why has <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> this been told <b>to</b> me before? “he asked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elven-tongue.
<br>   “We have not spoken <b>to</b> Haldir <b>of</b> our deeds <b>or</b> our purpose,” said Legolas. “At first we were weary <b>and</b> danger <b>was</b> too close behind <b>and</b> afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked <b>in</b> gladness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fair paths <b>of</b> L?rien.”
<br>   “Yet our grief <b>is</b> great <b>and</b> our loss cannot be mended,” said Frodo. “Gandalf <b>was</b> our guide, <b>and</b> he led us through Moria; <b>and</b> when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, <b>and</b> he fell.”
<br>   “Tell us now <b>the</b> full tale! “said Celeborn:
<br>   Then Aragorn recounted all that <b>had</b> happened upon <b>the</b> pass <b>of</b> Caradhras, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days that followed; <b>and</b> he spoke <b>of</b> Balin <b>and</b> his <b>book</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chamber <b>of</b> Mazarbul, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> narrow bridge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Terror. “An evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancient World <b>it</b> seemed, such as <b>I</b> have never seen before,” said Aragorn. “It <b>was</b> both a shadow <b>and</b> a flame, strong <b>and</b> terrible.”
<br>   “It <b>was</b> a Balrog <b>of</b> Morgoth,” said Legolas; “<b>of</b> all elf-banes <b>the</b> most deadly, save <b>the</b> One who sits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower.”
<br>   “Indeed <b>I</b> saw upon <b>the</b> bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams l saw Durin's Bane,” said Gimli <b>in</b> a low voice, <b>and</b> dread <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.
<br>   “Alas! “said Celeborn. “We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept. But <b>had</b> <b>I</b> known that <b>the</b> Dwarves <b>had</b> stirred up this evil <b>in</b> Moria again, l would have forbidden you <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> northern borders, you <b>and</b> all that went with you. And if <b>it</b> were possible, one would say that at <b>the</b> last Gandalf fell from wisdom <b>into</b> folly, going needlessly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net <b>of</b> Moria.”
<br>   “He would be rash indeed that said that thing,” said Galadriel gravely. “Needless were none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeds <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>in</b> life. Those that followed him knew not his mind <b>and</b> cannot report his full purpose. But however <b>it</b> may be with <b>the</b> guide, <b>the</b> followers are blameless. Do not repent <b>of</b> your welcome <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dwarf. If our folk <b>had</b> been exiled long <b>and</b> far from Lothl?rien, who <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim, even Celeborn <b>the</b> Wise, would pass nigh <b>and</b> would not wish <b>to</b> look upon their ancient home, though <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become an abode <b>of</b> dragons?
<br>   “Dark <b>is</b> <b>the</b> water <b>of</b> Kheled-z?ram, <b>and</b> cold are <b>the</b> springs <b>of</b> Kibil-n?la, <b>and</b> fair were <b>the</b> many-pillared halls <b>of</b> Khazad-d?m <b>in</b> Elder Days before <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> mighty kings beneath <b>the</b> stone.” She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering <b>and</b> sad, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> smiled. And <b>the</b> Dwarf, hearing <b>the</b> names given <b>in</b> his own ancient tongue, looked up <b>and</b> met <b>her</b> eyes; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he looked suddenly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> an enemy <b>and</b> saw there love <b>and</b> understanding. Wonder came <b>into</b> his face, <b>and</b> then he smiled <b>in</b> answer.
<br>   He rose clumsily <b>and</b> bowed <b>in</b> dwarf-fashion, saying: “Yet more fair <b>is</b> <b>the</b> living land <b>of</b> L?rien, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel <b>is</b> above all <b>the</b> jewels that lie beneath <b>the</b> earth!”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. “<b>I</b> did not know that your plight <b>was</b> so evil,” he said. “Let Gimli forget my harsh words: <b>I</b> spoke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> my heart. <b>I</b> will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>to</b> aid you, each according <b>to</b> his wish <b>and</b> need, <b>but</b> especially that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little folk who bears <b>the</b> burden.”
<br>   “Your quest <b>is</b> known <b>to</b> us,” said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. “But we will not here speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b> more openly. Yet not <b>in</b> vain will <b>it</b> prove, maybe, that you came <b>to</b> this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For <b>the</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim <b>is</b> accounted <b>the</b> wisest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> Middle-earth, <b>and</b> a giver <b>of</b> gifts beyond <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> kings. He has dwelt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West since <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> dawn, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> Nargothrond <b>or</b> Gondolin <b>I</b> passed over <b>the</b> mountains, <b>and</b> together through ages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world we have fought <b>the</b> long defeat.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> who first summoned <b>the</b> White Council. And if my designs <b>had</b> not gone amiss, <b>it</b> would have been governed <b>by</b> Gandalf <b>the</b> Grey, <b>and</b> then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there <b>is</b> hope left. <b>I</b> will not give you counsel, saying <b>do</b> this, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> that. For not <b>in</b> doing <b>or</b> contriving, nor <b>in</b> choosing between this course <b>and</b> another, can <b>I</b> avail; <b>but</b> only <b>in</b> knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b>, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> part also <b>what</b> shall be. But this <b>I</b> will say <b>to</b> you: your Quest stands upon <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> a knife. Stray <b>but</b> a little <b>and</b> <b>it</b> will fail, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ruin <b>of</b> all. Yet hope remains while all <b>the</b> Company <b>is</b> true.”
<br>   And with that word <b>she</b> held them with <b>her</b> eyes, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> silence looked searchingly at each <b>of</b> them <b>in</b> turn. None save Legolas <b>and</b> Aragorn could long endure <b>her</b> glance. Sam quickly blushed <b>and</b> hung his head.
<br>   At length <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel released them from <b>her</b> eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> smiled. “Do not let your hearts be troubled,” <b>she</b> said. “Tonight you shall sleep <b>in</b> peace.” Then they sighed <b>and</b> felt suddenly weary, as those who have been questioned long <b>and</b> deeply, though <b>no</b> words <b>had</b> been spoken openly.
<br>   “Go now! “said Celeborn. “You are worn with sorrow <b>and</b> much toil. Even if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge <b>in</b> this City, until you were healed <b>and</b> refreshed. Now you shall rest, <b>and</b> we will not speak <b>of</b> your further road for a while.”
<br>   That night <b>the</b> Company slept upon <b>the</b> ground, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among <b>the</b> trees near <b>the</b> fountain, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> they laid soft couches; then speaking words <b>of</b> peace with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while <b>the</b> travellers talked <b>of</b> their night before <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tree-tops, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> their day's journey, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady; for they <b>had</b> not yet <b>the</b> heart <b>to</b> look further back.
<br>   “What did you blush for, Sam? “said Pippin. “You soon broke down. Anyone would have <b>thought</b> you <b>had</b> a guilty conscience. <b>I</b> hope <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> worse than a wicked plot <b>to</b> steal one <b>of</b> my blankets.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>no</b> such thing,” answered Sam, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> mood for jest. “If you want <b>to</b> know, <b>I</b> felt as if <b>I</b> hadn't got <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't like <b>it</b>. She seemed <b>to</b> be looking inside me <b>and</b> asking me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would <b>do</b> if <b>she</b> gave me <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> flying back home <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>to</b> a nice little hole with-with a bit <b>of</b> garden <b>of</b> my own.”
<br>   “That's funny,” said Merry. “Almost exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> felt myself; only, only well, <b>I</b> don't think <b>I</b>'ll say any more,” he ended lamely.
<br>   All <b>of</b> them, <b>it</b> seemed, <b>had</b> fared alike: each <b>had</b> felt that he <b>was</b> offered a choice between a shadow full <b>of</b> fear that lay ahead, <b>and</b> something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind <b>it</b> lay, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> he <b>had</b> only <b>to</b> turn aside from <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> Quest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> war against Sauron <b>to</b> others.
<br>   “And <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> me, too,” said Gimli, “that my choice would remain secret <b>and</b> known only <b>to</b> myself.”
<br>   “To me <b>it</b> seemed exceedingly strange,” said Boromir. “Maybe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a test, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> read our thoughts for <b>her</b> own good purpose; <b>but</b> almost <b>I</b> should have said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tempting us, <b>and</b> offering <b>what</b> <b>she</b> pretended <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> power <b>to</b> give. It need not be said that <b>I</b> refused <b>to</b> listen. The Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith are true <b>to</b> their word.” But <b>what</b> he <b>thought</b> that <b>the</b> Lady <b>had</b> offered him Boromir did not tell.
<br>   And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions. “She held you long <b>in</b> <b>her</b> gaze, Ring-bearer,” he said.
<br>   “Yes,” said Frodo; “<b>but</b> whatever came <b>into</b> my mind then <b>I</b> will keep there.”
<br>   “Well, have a care! “said Boromir. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel too sure <b>of</b> this Elvish Lady <b>and</b> <b>her</b> purposes.”
<br>   “Speak <b>no</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel! “said Aragorn sternly. “You know not <b>what</b> you say. There <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>in</b> this land <b>no</b> evil, unless a man bring <b>it</b> hither himself. Then let him beware! But tonight <b>I</b> shall sleep <b>without</b> fear for <b>the</b> first time since <b>I</b> left Rivendell. And may <b>I</b> sleep deep, <b>and</b> forget for a while my grief! <b>I</b> am weary <b>in</b> body <b>and</b> <b>in</b> heart.” He cast himself down upon his couch <b>and</b> fell at <b>once</b> <b>into</b> a long sleep.
<br>   The others soon did <b>the</b> same, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> sound <b>or</b> dream disturbed their slumber. When they woke they found that <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> day <b>was</b> broad upon <b>the</b> lawn before <b>the</b> pavilion. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fountain rose <b>and</b> fell glittering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun.
<br>   They remained some days <b>in</b> Lothl?rien, so far as they could tell <b>or</b> remember. All <b>the</b> while that they dwelt there <b>the</b> sun shone clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at times, <b>and</b> passed away leaving all things fresh <b>and</b> clean. The air <b>was</b> cool <b>and</b> soft, as if <b>it</b> were early spring, yet they felt about them <b>the</b> deep <b>and</b> thoughtful quiet <b>of</b> winter. It seemed <b>to</b> them that they did little <b>but</b> eat <b>and</b> drink <b>and</b> rest, <b>and</b> walk among <b>the</b> trees; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> enough.
<br>   They <b>had</b> not seen <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady again, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> little speech with <b>the</b> Elven-folk; for few <b>of</b> these knew <b>or</b> would <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Westron tongue. Haldir <b>had</b> bidden them farewell <b>and</b> gone back again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, where great watch <b>was</b> now kept since <b>the</b> tidings <b>of</b> Moria that <b>the</b> Company <b>had</b> brought. Legolas <b>was</b> away much among <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>and</b> after <b>the</b> first night he did not sleep with <b>the</b> other companions, though he returned <b>to</b> eat <b>and</b> talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others wondered at this change.
<br>   Now as <b>the</b> companions sat <b>or</b> walked together they spoke <b>of</b> Gandalf, <b>and</b> all that each <b>had</b> known <b>and</b> seen <b>of</b> him came clear before their minds. As they were healed <b>of</b> hurt <b>and</b> weariness <b>of</b> body <b>the</b> grief <b>of</b> their loss grew more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, <b>and</b> knew that they were making songs <b>of</b> lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among <b>the</b> sweet sad words that they could not understand.
<br>   Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang <b>the</b> Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they loved <b>to</b> call him. But if Legolas <b>was</b> with <b>the</b> Company, he would not interpret <b>the</b> songs for them, saying that he <b>had</b> not <b>the</b> skill, <b>and</b> that for him <b>the</b> grief <b>was</b> still too near, a matter for tears <b>and</b> not yet for song.
<br>   It <b>was</b> Frodo who first put something <b>of</b> his sorrow <b>into</b> halting words. He <b>was</b> seldom moved <b>to</b> make song <b>or</b> rhyme; even <b>in</b> Rivendell he <b>had</b> listened <b>and</b> <b>had</b> not sung himself, though his memory <b>was</b> stored with many things that others <b>had</b> made before him. But now as he sat beside <b>the</b> fountain <b>in</b> L?rien <b>and</b> heard about him <b>the</b> voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, his <b>thought</b> took shape <b>in</b> a song that seemed fair <b>to</b> him; yet when he tried <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Sam only snatches remained, faded as a handful <b>of</b> withered leaves.
<br>   
<br>When evening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>was</b> grey
<br>his footsteps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hill were heard;
<br>before <b>the</b> dawn he went away
<br><b>on</b> journey long <b>without</b> a word.
<br>
<br>From Wilderland <b>to</b> Western shore,
<br>from northern waste <b>to</b> southern hill,
<br>through dragon-lair <b>and</b> hidden door
<br><b>and</b> darkling woods he walked at will.
<br>
<br>With Dwarf <b>and</b> Hobbit, Elves <b>and</b> Men,
<br>with mortal <b>and</b> immortal folk,
<br>with bird <b>on</b> bough <b>and</b> beast <b>in</b> den,
<br><b>in</b> their own secret tongues he spoke.
<br>
<br>A deadly sword, a healing hand,
<br>a back that bent beneath its load;
<br>a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,
<br>a weary pilgrim <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road.
<br>
<br>A lord <b>of</b> wisdom throned he sat,
<br>swift <b>in</b> anger, quick <b>to</b> laugh;
<br>an old man <b>in</b> a battered hat
<br>who leaned upon a thorny staff.
<br>
<br>He stood upon <b>the</b> bridge alone
<br><b>and</b> Fire <b>and</b> Shadow both defied;
<br>his staff <b>was</b> broken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone,
<br><b>in</b> Khazad-d?m his wisdom died.
<br>   
<br>   “Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! “said Sam.
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> am afraid not,” said Frodo. “But that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> yet.”
<br>   “Well, Mr. Frodo, if you <b>do</b> have another go, <b>I</b> hope you'll say a word about his fireworks,” said Sam. “Something like this:
<br>   
<br>The finest rockets ever seen:
<br>they burst <b>in</b> stars <b>of</b> blue <b>and</b> green,
<br><b>or</b> after thunder golden showers
<br>came falling like a rain <b>of</b> flowers.
<br>   
<br>   Though that doesn't <b>do</b> them justice <b>by</b> a long road.”
<br>   “No, <b>I</b>'ll leave that <b>to</b> you, Sam. Or perhaps <b>to</b> Bilbo. But-well. <b>I</b> can't talk <b>of</b> <b>it</b> any more. <b>I</b> can't bear <b>to</b> think <b>of</b> bringing <b>the</b> news <b>to</b> him.”
<br>   One evening Frodo <b>and</b> Sam were walking together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cool twilight. Both <b>of</b> them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> parting <b>had</b> fallen: he knew somehow that <b>the</b> time <b>was</b> <b>very</b> near when he must leave Lothl?rien.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you think <b>of</b> Elves now, Sam? “he said. “<b>I</b> asked you <b>the</b> same question <b>once</b> before-<b>it</b> seems a <b>very</b> long while ago; <b>but</b> you have seen more <b>of</b> them since then.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> have indeed! “said Sam. “And <b>I</b> reckon there's Elves <b>and</b> Elves. They're all elvish enough, <b>but</b> they're not all <b>the</b> same. Now these folk aren't wanderers <b>or</b> homeless, <b>and</b> seem a bit nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> likes <b>of</b> us: they seem <b>to</b> belong here, more even than Hobbits <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Whether they've made <b>the</b> land, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> land's made them, <b>it</b>'s hard <b>to</b> say, if you take my meaning. It's wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems <b>to</b> be going <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> nobody seems <b>to</b> want <b>it</b> <b>to</b>. If there's any magic about, <b>it</b>'s right down deep, where <b>I</b> can't lay my hands <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>in</b> a manner <b>of</b> speaking.”
<br>   “You can see <b>and</b> feel <b>it</b> everywhere,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Well,” said Sam, “you can't see nobody working <b>it</b>. No fireworks like poor Gandalf used <b>to</b> show. <b>I</b> wonder we don't see <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady <b>in</b> all these days. <b>I</b> fancy now that <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> some wonderful things, if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a mind. <b>I</b>'d dearly love <b>to</b> see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> wouldn't,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> am content. And <b>I</b> don't miss Gandalf's fireworks, <b>but</b> his bushy eyebrows, <b>and</b> his quick temper, <b>and</b> his voice.”
<br>   “You're right,” said Sam. “And don't think <b>I</b>'m finding fault. <b>I</b>'ve often wanted <b>to</b> see a bit <b>of</b> magic like <b>what</b> <b>it</b> tells <b>of</b> <b>in</b> old tales, <b>but</b> <b>I</b>'ve never heard <b>of</b> a better land than this. It's like being at home <b>and</b> <b>on</b> a holiday at <b>the</b> same time, if you understand me. <b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> leave. All <b>the</b> same, <b>I</b>'m <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel that if we've got <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>, then we'd best <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over.
<br>   “It's <b>the</b> job that's never started as takes longest <b>to</b> finish, as my old gaffer used <b>to</b> say. And <b>I</b> don't reckon that these folk can <b>do</b> much more <b>to</b> help us, magic <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, <b>I</b>'m thinking.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> am afraid that's only too true, Sam,” said Frodo. “Yet <b>I</b> hope <b>very</b> much that before we leave we shall see <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves again.”
<br>   Even as he spoke, they saw, as if <b>she</b> came <b>in</b> answer <b>to</b> their words, <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall <b>and</b> white <b>and</b> fair <b>she</b> walked beneath <b>the</b> trees. She spoke <b>no</b> word, <b>but</b> beckoned <b>to</b> them.
<br>   Turning aside, <b>she</b> led them toward <b>the</b> southern slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>of</b> Caras Galadhon, <b>and</b> passing through a high green hedge they came <b>into</b> an enclosed garden. No trees grew there, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> lay open <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky. The evening star <b>had</b> risen <b>and</b> <b>was</b> shining with white fire above <b>the</b> western woods. Down a long flight <b>of</b> steps <b>the</b> Lady went <b>into</b> a deep green hollow, through which ran murmuring <b>the</b> silver stream that issued from <b>the</b> fountain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill. At <b>the</b> bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree, stood a basin <b>of</b> silver. wide <b>and</b> shallow, <b>and</b> beside <b>it</b> stood a silver ewer.
<br>   With water from <b>the</b> stream Galadriel filled <b>the</b> basin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> brim, <b>and</b> breathed <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> water <b>was</b> still again <b>she</b> spoke. “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mirror <b>of</b> Galadriel,” <b>she</b> said. “<b>I</b> have brought you here so that you may look <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, if you will.”
<br>   The air <b>was</b> <b>very</b> still, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dell <b>was</b> dark, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Elf-lady beside him <b>was</b> tall <b>and</b> pale. “What shall we look for, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> shall we see? “asked Frodo, filled with awe.
<br>   “Many things <b>I</b> can command <b>the</b> Mirror <b>to</b> reveal,” <b>she</b> answered, “<b>and</b> <b>to</b> some <b>I</b> can show <b>what</b> they desire <b>to</b> see. But <b>the</b> Mirror will also show things unbidden, <b>and</b> those are often stranger <b>and</b> more profitable than things which we wish <b>to</b> behold. What you will see, if you leave <b>the</b> Mirror free <b>to</b> work, <b>I</b> cannot tell. For <b>it</b> shows things that were, <b>and</b> things that are, things that yet may be. But which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that he sees, even <b>the</b> wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish <b>to</b> look?”
<br>   Frodo did not answer.
<br>   “And you? “<b>she</b> said, turning <b>to</b> Sam. “For this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> your folk would call magic. <b>I</b> believe; though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand clearly <b>what</b> they mean; <b>and</b> they seem also <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same word <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. But this, if you will, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> magic <b>of</b> Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished <b>to</b> see Elf-magic?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> did,” said Sam, trembling a little between fear <b>and</b> curiosity. “<b>I</b>'ll have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.”
<br>   “And <b>I</b>'d not mind a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>what</b>'s going <b>on</b> at home,” he said <b>in</b> an aside <b>to</b> Frodo. “It seems a terrible long time that <b>I</b>'ve been away. But there, like as not <b>I</b>'ll only see <b>the</b> stars, <b>or</b> something that <b>I</b> won't understand.”
<br>   “Like as not,” said <b>the</b> Lady with a gentle laugh. “But come, you shall look <b>and</b> see <b>what</b> you may. Do not touch <b>the</b> water!”
<br>   Sam climbed up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pedestal <b>and</b> leaned over <b>the</b> basin. The water looked hard <b>and</b> dark. Stars were reflected <b>in</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>   “There's only stars, as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b>,” he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for <b>the</b> stars went out. As if a dark veil <b>had</b> been withdrawn, <b>the</b> Mirror grew grey, <b>and</b> then clear. There <b>was</b> sun shining, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> trees were waving <b>and</b> tossing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. But before Sam could make up his mind <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that he saw, <b>the</b> light faded; <b>and</b> now he <b>thought</b> he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed <b>to</b> see himself going along a dim passage, <b>and</b> climbing an endless winding stair. It came <b>to</b> him suddenly that he <b>was</b> looking urgently for something, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> he did not know. Like a dream <b>the</b> vision shifted <b>and</b> went back, <b>and</b> he saw <b>the</b> trees again. But this time they were not so close, <b>and</b> he could see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going <b>on</b>: they were not waving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, they were falling, crashing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.
<br>   “Hi!” cried Sam <b>in</b> an outraged voice. “There's that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought <b>to</b> be felled: <b>it</b>'s that avenue beyond <b>the</b> Mill that shades <b>the</b> road <b>to</b> Bywater. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> at Ted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'d fell him!”
<br>   But now Sam noticed that <b>the</b> Old Mill <b>had</b> vanished, <b>and</b> a large red-brick building <b>was</b> being put up where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> stood. Lots <b>of</b> folk were busily at work. There <b>was</b> a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed <b>to</b> cloud <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirror.
<br>   “There's some devilry at work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire,” he said. “Elrond knew <b>what</b> he <b>was</b> about when he wanted <b>to</b> send Mr. Merry back.” Then suddenly Sam gave a cry <b>and</b> sprang away. “<b>I</b> can't stay here,” he said wildly. “<b>I</b> must go home. They've dug up Bagshot Row, <b>and</b> there's <b>the</b> poor old gaffer going down <b>the</b> Hill with his bits <b>of</b> things <b>on</b> a barrow. <b>I</b> must go home!”
<br>   “You cannot go home alone,” said <b>the</b> Lady. “You did not wish <b>to</b> go home <b>without</b> your master before you looked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mirror, <b>and</b> yet you knew that evil things might well be happening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire. Remember that <b>the</b> Mirror shows many things, <b>and</b> not all have yet come <b>to</b> pass. Some never come <b>to</b> be, unless those that behold <b>the</b> visions turn aside from their path <b>to</b> prevent them. The Mirror <b>is</b> dangerous as a guide <b>of</b> deeds.”
<br>   Sam sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>and</b> put his head <b>in</b> his hands. “<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never come here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> see <b>no</b> more magic,” he said <b>and</b> fell silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. “No, <b>I</b>'ll go home <b>by</b> <b>the</b> long road with Mr. Frodo, <b>or</b> not at all,” he said. “But <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> back some day. If <b>what</b> <b>I</b>'ve seen turns out true, somebody's going <b>to</b> catch <b>it</b> hot!”
<br>   “Do you now wish <b>to</b> look, Frodo? “said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel. “You did not wish <b>to</b> see Elf-magic <b>and</b> were content.”
<br>   “Do you advise me <b>to</b> look? “asked Frodo.
<br>   “No,” <b>she</b> said. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not counsel you one way <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. <b>I</b> am not a counsellor. You may learn something, <b>and</b> whether <b>what</b> you see be fair <b>or</b> evil, that may be profitable, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> may not. Seeing <b>is</b> both good <b>and</b> perilous. Yet <b>I</b> think, Frodo, that you have courage <b>and</b> wisdom enough for <b>the</b> venture, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> would not have brought you here. Do as you will!”
<br>   “<b>I</b> will look,” said Frodo, <b>and</b> he climbed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pedestal <b>and</b> bent over <b>the</b> dark water. At <b>once</b> <b>the</b> Mirror cleared <b>and</b> he saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out <b>of</b> sight. Far away a figure came slowly down <b>the</b> road, faint <b>and</b> small at first, <b>but</b> growing larger <b>and</b> clearer as <b>it</b> approached. Suddenly Frodo realized that <b>it</b> reminded him <b>of</b> Gandalf. He almost called aloud <b>the</b> wizard's name, <b>and</b> then he saw that <b>the</b> figure <b>was</b> clothed not <b>in</b> grey <b>but</b> <b>in</b> white, <b>in</b> a white that shone faintly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dusk; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> its hand there <b>was</b> a white staff. The head <b>was</b> so bowed that he could see <b>no</b> face, <b>and</b> presently <b>the</b> figure turned aside round a bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road <b>and</b> went out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mirror's view. Doubt came <b>into</b> Frodo's mind: <b>was</b> this a vision <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> his many lonely journeys long ago, <b>or</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> Saruman?
<br>   The vision now changed. Brief <b>and</b> small <b>but</b> <b>very</b> vivid he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table <b>was</b> littered with disordered papers; rain <b>was</b> beating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> windows.
<br>   Then there <b>was</b> a pause, <b>and</b> after <b>it</b> many swift scenes followed that Frodo <b>in</b> some way knew <b>to</b> be parts <b>of</b> a great history <b>in</b> which he <b>had</b> become involved. The mist cleared <b>and</b> he saw a sight which he <b>had</b> never seen before <b>but</b> knew at <b>once</b>: <b>the</b> Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose <b>and</b> raged <b>in</b> a great storm. Then he saw against <b>the</b> Sun, sinking blood-red <b>into</b> a wrack <b>of</b> clouds, <b>the</b> black outline <b>of</b> a tall ship with torn sails riding up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, <b>but</b> now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> morning again, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water rippled with light, <b>and</b> a banner bearing <b>the</b> emblem <b>of</b> a white tree shone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. A smoke as <b>of</b> fire <b>and</b> battle arose, <b>and</b> again <b>the</b> sun went down <b>in</b> a burning red that faded <b>into</b> a grey mist; <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, <b>and</b> Frodo sighed <b>and</b> prepared <b>to</b> draw away.
<br>   But suddenly <b>the</b> Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole <b>had</b> opened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> sight, <b>and</b> Frodo looked <b>into</b> emptiness. In <b>the</b> black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew. until <b>it</b> filled nearly all <b>the</b> Mirror. So terrible <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that Frodo stood rooted, unable <b>to</b> cry out <b>or</b> <b>to</b> withdraw his gaze. The Eye <b>was</b> rimmed with fire, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful <b>and</b> intent, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black slit <b>of</b> its pupil opened <b>on</b> a pit, a window <b>into</b> <b>nothing</b>.
<br>   Then <b>the</b> Eye began <b>to</b> rove, searching this way <b>and</b> that; <b>and</b> Frodo knew with certainty <b>and</b> horror that among <b>the</b> many things that <b>it</b> sought he himself <b>was</b> one. But he also knew that <b>it</b> could not see him-not yet, not unless he willed <b>it</b>. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, <b>and</b> his head <b>was</b> dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed <b>to</b> be growing hot <b>and</b> curls <b>of</b> steam were rising from <b>the</b> water. He <b>was</b> slipping forward.
<br>   “Do not touch <b>the</b> water!” said <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, <b>and</b> Frodo found that he <b>was</b> looking at <b>the</b> cool stars twinkling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over <b>and</b> looked at <b>the</b> Lady.
<br>   “<b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that you last saw,” <b>she</b> said; “for that <b>is</b> also <b>in</b> my mind. Do not be afraid! But <b>do</b> not think that only <b>by</b> singing amid <b>the</b> trees, nor even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> slender arrows <b>of</b> elven-bows, <b>is</b> this land <b>of</b> Lothl?rien maintained <b>and</b> defended against its Enemy. <b>I</b> say <b>to</b> you, Frodo, that even as <b>I</b> speak <b>to</b> you, <b>I</b> perceive <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>and</b> know his mind, <b>or</b> all <b>of</b> his mind that concerns <b>the</b> Elves. And he gropes ever <b>to</b> see me <b>and</b> my <b>thought</b>. But still <b>the</b> door <b>is</b> closed!”
<br>   She lifted up <b>her</b> white arms, <b>and</b> spread out <b>her</b> hands towards <b>the</b> East <b>in</b> a gesture <b>of</b> rejection <b>and</b> denial. E?rendil, <b>the</b> Evening Star, most beloved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves, shone clear above. So bright <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elven-lady cast a dim shadow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring about <b>her</b> finger; <b>it</b> glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver light, <b>and</b> a white stone <b>in</b> <b>it</b> twinkled as if <b>the</b> Even-star <b>had</b> come down <b>to</b> rest upon <b>her</b> hand. Frodo gazed at <b>the</b> ring with awe; for suddenly <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> him that he understood.
<br>   “Yes,” <b>she</b> said, divining his <b>thought</b>, “<b>it</b> <b>is</b> not permitted <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> Elrond could not <b>do</b> so. But <b>it</b> cannot be hidden from <b>the</b> Ring-bearer, <b>and</b> one who has seen <b>the</b> Eye. Verily <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> L?rien upon <b>the</b> finger <b>of</b> Galadriel that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three remains. This <b>is</b> Nenya, <b>the</b> Ring <b>of</b> Adamant, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am its keeper.
<br>   “He suspects, <b>but</b> he does not know—not yet. Do you not see now wherefore your coming <b>is</b> <b>to</b> us as <b>the</b> footstep <b>of</b> Doom? For if you fail, then we are laid bare <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power <b>is</b> diminished, <b>and</b> Lothl?rien will fade, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tides <b>of</b> Time will sweep <b>it</b> away. We must depart <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>or</b> dwindle <b>to</b> a rustic folk <b>of</b> dell <b>and</b> cave, slowly <b>to</b> forget <b>and</b> <b>to</b> be forgotten.”
<br>   Frodo bent his head. “And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you wish? “he said at last.
<br>   “That <b>what</b> should be shall be,” <b>she</b> answered. “The love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves for their land <b>and</b> their works <b>is</b> deeper than <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> their regret <b>is</b> undying <b>and</b> cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit <b>to</b> Sauron: for they know him now. For <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> Lothl?rien you are not answerable <b>but</b> only for <b>the</b> doing <b>of</b> your own task. Yet <b>I</b> could wish, were <b>it</b> <b>of</b> any avail, that <b>the</b> One Ring <b>had</b> never been wrought, <b>or</b> <b>had</b> remained for ever lost.”
<br>   “You are wise <b>and</b> fearless <b>and</b> fair, Lady Galadriel,” said Frodo. “<b>I</b> will give you <b>the</b> One Ring, if you ask for <b>it</b>. It <b>is</b> too great a matter for me.”
<br>   Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. “Wise <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel may be,” <b>she</b> said, “yet here <b>she</b> has met <b>her</b> match <b>in</b> courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my testing <b>of</b> your heart at our first meeting. You begin <b>to</b> see with a keen eye. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not deny that my heart has greatly desired <b>to</b> ask <b>what</b> you offer. For many long years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pondered <b>what</b> <b>I</b> might <b>do</b>, should <b>the</b> Great Ring come <b>into</b> my hands, <b>and</b> behold! <b>it</b> <b>was</b> brought within my grasp. The evil that <b>was</b> devised long ago works <b>on</b> <b>in</b> many ways, whether Sauron himself stands <b>or</b> falls. Would not that have been a noble deed <b>to</b> set <b>to</b> <b>the</b> credit <b>of</b> his Ring, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>it</b> <b>by</b> force <b>or</b> fear from my guest?
<br>   “And now at last <b>it</b> comes. You will give me <b>the</b> Ring freely! In place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And <b>I</b> shall not be dark, <b>but</b> beautiful <b>and</b> terrible as <b>the</b> Morning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Night! Fair as <b>the</b> Sea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Snow upon <b>the</b> Mountain! Dreadful as <b>the</b> Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Lightning! Stronger than <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. All shall love me <b>and</b> despair!”
<br>   She lifted up <b>her</b> hand <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> ring that <b>she</b> wore there issued a great light that illuminated <b>her</b> alone <b>and</b> left all else dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, <b>and</b> beautiful beyond enduring, terrible <b>and</b> worshipful. Then <b>she</b> let <b>her</b> hand fall, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light faded, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>she</b> laughed again, <b>and</b> lo! <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad <b>in</b> simple white, whose gentle voice <b>was</b> soft <b>and</b> sad.
<br>   “<b>I</b> pass <b>the</b> test,” <b>she</b> said. “<b>I</b> will diminish, <b>and</b> go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West <b>and</b> remain Galadriel.”
<br>   They stood for a long while <b>in</b> silence. At length <b>the</b> Lady spoke again. “Let us return! “<b>she</b> said. “In <b>the</b> morning you must depart for now we have chosen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tides <b>of</b> fate are flowing.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> would ask one thing before we go,” said Frodo, “a thing which <b>I</b> often meant <b>to</b> ask Gandalf <b>in</b> Rivendell. <b>I</b> am permitted <b>to</b> wear <b>the</b> One Ring: why cannot <b>I</b> see all <b>the</b> others <b>and</b> know <b>the</b> thoughts <b>of</b> those that wear them?”
<br>   “You have not tried,” <b>she</b> said. “Only thrice have you set <b>the</b> Ring upon your finger since you knew <b>what</b> you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf tell you that <b>the</b> rings give power according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> measure <b>of</b> each possessor? Before you could <b>use</b> that power you would need <b>to</b> become far stronger, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> train your will <b>to</b> <b>the</b> domination <b>of</b> others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer <b>and</b> as one that has borne <b>it</b> <b>on</b> finger <b>and</b> seen that which <b>is</b> hidden, your sight <b>is</b> grown keener. You have perceived my <b>thought</b> more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw <b>the</b> Eye <b>of</b> him that holds <b>the</b> Seven <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nine. And did you not see <b>and</b> recognize <b>the</b> ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring? “<b>she</b> asked turning again <b>to</b> Sam.
<br>   “No, Lady,” he answered. “To tell you <b>the</b> truth, <b>I</b> wondered <b>what</b> you were talking about. <b>I</b> saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon my speaking out, <b>I</b> think my master <b>was</b> right. <b>I</b> wish you'd take his Ring. You'd put things <b>to</b> rights. You'd stop them digging up <b>the</b> gaffer <b>and</b> turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> would,” <b>she</b> said. “That <b>is</b> how <b>it</b> would begin. But <b>it</b> would not stop with that, alas! We will not speak more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Let us go!”
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 8
<br>FAREWELL TO L?RIEN
<br>
<br>   That night <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> again summoned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>of</b> Celeborn, <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn spoke <b>of</b> their departure.
<br>   “Now <b>is</b> <b>the</b> time,” he said, “when those who wish <b>to</b> continue <b>the</b> Quest must harden their hearts <b>to</b> leave this land. Those who <b>no</b> longer wish <b>to</b> go forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay <b>or</b> go, none can be sure <b>of</b> peace. For we are come now <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> doom. Here those who wish may await <b>the</b> oncoming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hour till either <b>the</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world lie open again. <b>or</b> we summon them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last need <b>of</b> L?rien. Then they may return <b>to</b> their own lands, <b>or</b> else go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> long home <b>of</b> those that fall <b>in</b> battle.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a silence. “They all resolved <b>to</b> go forward,” said Galadriel looking <b>in</b> their eyes.
<br>   “As for me,” said Boromir, “my way home lies onward <b>and</b> not back.”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> true,” said Celeborn, “<b>but</b> <b>is</b> all this Company going with you <b>to</b> Minas Tirith?”
<br>   “We have not decided our course,” said Aragorn. “Beyond Lothl?rien <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> Gandalf intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b>. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that even he <b>had</b> any clear purpose.”
<br>   “Maybe not,” said Celeborn, “yet when you leave this land, you can <b>no</b> longer forget <b>the</b> Great River. As some <b>of</b> you know well, <b>it</b> cannot be crossed <b>by</b> travellers with baggage between L?rien <b>and</b> Gondor, save <b>by</b> boat. And are not <b>the</b> bridges <b>of</b> Osgiliath broken down <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> landings held now <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Enemy?
<br>   “On which side will you journey? The way <b>to</b> Minas Tirith lies upon this side, upon <b>the</b> west; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> straight road <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest lies east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, upon <b>the</b> darker shore. Which shore will you now take?”
<br>   “If my advice <b>is</b> heeded, <b>it</b> will be <b>the</b> western shore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> Minas Tirith,” answered Boromir. “But <b>I</b> am not <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company.” The others said <b>nothing</b>, <b>and</b> Aragorn looked doubtful <b>and</b> troubled.
<br>   “<b>I</b> see that you <b>do</b> not yet know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>,” said Celeborn. “It <b>is</b> not my part <b>to</b> choose for you; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> will help you as <b>I</b> may. There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know <b>the</b> swift Forest River; <b>and</b> Boromir <b>of</b> Gondor; <b>and</b> Aragorn <b>the</b> traveller.”
<br>   “And one Hobbit! “cried Merry. “Not all <b>of</b> us look <b>on</b> boats as wild horses. My people live <b>by</b> <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brandywine.”
<br>   “That <b>is</b> well,” said Celeborn. “Then <b>I</b> will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small <b>and</b> light, for if you go far <b>by</b> water, there are places where you will be forced <b>to</b> carry them. You will come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rapids <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir, <b>and</b> maybe at last <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great falls <b>of</b> Rauros where <b>the</b> River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; <b>and</b> there are other perils. Boats may make your journey less toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end you must leave them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> turn west-<b>or</b> east.”
<br>   Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift <b>of</b> boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be <b>no</b> need <b>to</b> decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, <b>it</b> seemed better <b>to</b> float down <b>the</b> broad tide <b>of</b> Anduin <b>to</b> meet them than <b>to</b> plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam <b>was</b> doubtful: he at any rate still <b>thought</b> boats as bad as wild horses, <b>or</b> worse, <b>and</b> not all <b>the</b> dangers that he <b>had</b> survived made him think better <b>of</b> them.
<br>   “All shall be prepared for you <b>and</b> await you at <b>the</b> haven before noon tomorrow,” said Celeborn. “<b>I</b> will send my people <b>to</b> you <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>to</b> help you make ready for <b>the</b> journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night <b>and</b> untroubled sleep.”
<br>   “Good night, my friends! “said Galadriel. “Sleep <b>in</b> peace! Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road tonight. Maybe <b>the</b> paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though you <b>do</b> not see them. Good night!”
<br>   The Company now took their leave <b>and</b> returned <b>to</b> their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for this <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be their last night <b>in</b> Lothl?rien, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words <b>of</b> Galadriel they wished <b>to</b> take counsel together.
<br>   For a long time they debated <b>what</b> they should <b>do</b>, <b>and</b> how <b>it</b> would be best <b>to</b> attempt <b>the</b> fulfilling <b>of</b> their purpose with <b>the</b> Ring: <b>but</b> they came <b>to</b> <b>no</b> decision. It <b>was</b> plain that most <b>of</b> them desired <b>to</b> go first <b>to</b> Minas Tirith, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> escape at least for a while from <b>the</b> terror <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy. They would have been willing <b>to</b> follow a leader over <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Mordor; <b>but</b> Frodo spoke <b>no</b> word, <b>and</b> Aragorn <b>was</b> still divided <b>in</b> his mind.
<br>   His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, <b>had</b> been <b>to</b> go with Boromir, <b>and</b> with his sword help <b>to</b> deliver Gondor. For he believed that <b>the</b> message <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dreams <b>was</b> a summons, <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> hour <b>had</b> come at last when <b>the</b> heir <b>of</b> Elendil should come forth <b>and</b> strive with Sauron for <b>the</b> mastery. But <b>in</b> Moria <b>the</b> burden <b>of</b> Gandalf <b>had</b> been laid <b>on</b> him; <b>and</b> he knew that he could not now forsake <b>the</b> Ring, if Frodo refused <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>to</b> go with Boromir. And yet <b>what</b> help could he <b>or</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company give <b>to</b> Frodo, save <b>to</b> walk blindly with him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness?
<br>   “<b>I</b> shall go <b>to</b> Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> my duty,” said Boromir; <b>and</b> after that he <b>was</b> silent for a while, <b>sitting</b> with his eyes fixed <b>on</b> Frodo, as if he <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> Halfling's thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly, as if he <b>was</b> debating with himself. “If you wish only <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> Ring,” he said, “then there <b>is</b> little <b>use</b> <b>in</b> war <b>and</b> weapons; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> armed might <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> folly <b>to</b> go <b>without</b> force <b>into</b> his domain; <b>and</b> folly <b>to</b> throw away.” He paused suddenly, as if he <b>had</b> become aware that he <b>was</b> speaking his thoughts aloud. “It would be folly <b>to</b> throw lives away, <b>I</b> mean,” he ended. “It <b>is</b> a choice between defending a strong place <b>and</b> walking openly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> arms <b>of</b> death. At least, that <b>is</b> how <b>I</b> see <b>it</b>.”
<br>   Frodo caught something new <b>and</b> strange <b>in</b> Boromir's glance, <b>and</b> he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> different from his final words. It would be folly <b>to</b> throw away: <b>what</b>? The Ring <b>of</b> Power? He <b>had</b> said something like this at <b>the</b> Council, <b>but</b> then he <b>had</b> accepted <b>the</b> correction <b>of</b> Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, <b>but</b> he seemed deep <b>in</b> his own <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> made <b>no</b> sign that he <b>had</b> heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate ended. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin were already asleep, <b>and</b> Sam <b>was</b> nodding. The night <b>was</b> growing old.
<br>   In <b>the</b> morning, as they were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came <b>to</b> them <b>and</b> brought them many gifts <b>of</b> food <b>and</b> clothing for <b>the</b> journey. The food <b>was</b> mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>very</b> thin cakes, made <b>of</b> a meal that <b>was</b> baked a light brown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside, <b>and</b> inside <b>was</b> <b>the</b> colour <b>of</b> cream. Gimli took up one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cakes <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> with a doubtful eye.
<br>   “Cram,” he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner <b>and</b> nibbled at <b>it</b>. His expression quickly changed, <b>and</b> he ate all <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake with relish.
<br>   “No more, <b>no</b> more!” cried <b>the</b> Elves laughing. “You have eaten enough already for a long day's march.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a kind <b>of</b> cram, such as <b>the</b> Dale-men make for journeys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild,” said <b>the</b> Dwarf.
<br>   “So <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” they answered. “But we call <b>it</b> lembas <b>or</b> waybread, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more strengthening than any food made <b>by</b> Men, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more pleasant than cram, <b>by</b> all accounts.”
<br>   “Indeed <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” said Gimli. “Why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better than <b>the</b> honey-cakes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beornings, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> great praise, for <b>the</b> Beornings are <b>the</b> best bakers that <b>I</b> know <b>of</b>; <b>but</b> they are none too willing <b>to</b> deal out their cakes <b>to</b> travellers <b>in</b> these days. You are kindly hosts!”
<br>   “All <b>the</b> same, we bid you spare <b>the</b> food,” they said. “Eat little at a time, <b>and</b> only at need. For these things are given <b>to</b> serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken <b>and</b> left <b>in</b> their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will keep a traveller <b>on</b> his feet for a day <b>of</b> long labour, even if he be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tall Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith.”
<br>   The Elves next unwrapped <b>and</b> gave <b>to</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>the</b> clothes they <b>had</b> brought. For each they <b>had</b> provided a hood <b>and</b> cloak, made according <b>to</b> his size, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light <b>but</b> warm silken stuff that <b>the</b> Galadhrim wove. It <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> colour they were: grey with <b>the</b> hue <b>of</b> twilight under <b>the</b> trees they seemed <b>to</b> be; <b>and</b> yet if they were moved, <b>or</b> set <b>in</b> another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, <b>or</b> brown as fallow fields <b>by</b> night, dusk-silver as water under <b>the</b> stars. Each cloak <b>was</b> fastened about <b>the</b> neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.
<br>   “Are these magic cloaks? “asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> you mean <b>by</b> that,” answered <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. “They are fair garments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> web <b>is</b> good, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made <b>in</b> this land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you mean. Leaf <b>and</b> branch, water <b>and</b> stone: they have <b>the</b> hue <b>and</b> beauty <b>of</b> all these things under <b>the</b> twilight <b>of</b> L?rien that we love; for we put <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> all that we love <b>into</b> all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, <b>and</b> they will not turn shaft <b>or</b> blade. But they should serve you well: they are light <b>to</b> wear, <b>and</b> warm enough <b>or</b> cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid <b>in</b> keeping out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sight <b>of</b> unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among <b>the</b> stones <b>or</b> <b>the</b> trees. You are indeed high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady! For <b>she</b> herself <b>and</b> <b>her</b> maidens wove this stuff; <b>and</b> never before have we clad strangers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garb <b>of</b> our own people.”
<br>   After their morning meal <b>the</b> Company said farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fair place, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become like home <b>to</b> them, though they could not count <b>the</b> days <b>and</b> nights that they <b>had</b> passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at <b>the</b> white water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over <b>the</b> green grass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have returned from <b>the</b> Northern Fences,” said <b>the</b> Elf, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sent now <b>to</b> be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale <b>is</b> full <b>of</b> vapour <b>and</b> clouds <b>of</b> smoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountains are troubled. There are noises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deeps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. If any <b>of</b> you <b>had</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> returning northwards <b>to</b> your homes, you would not have been able <b>to</b> pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.”
<br>   As they walked through Caras Galadhon <b>the</b> green ways were empty; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees above them many voices were murmuring <b>and</b> singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them down <b>the</b> southward slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> they came again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> great gate hung with lamps, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white bridge; <b>and</b> so they passed out <b>and</b> left <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves. Then they turned away from <b>the</b> paved road <b>and</b> took a path that went off <b>into</b> a deep thicket <b>of</b> mallorn-trees, <b>and</b> passed <b>on</b>, winding through rolling woodlands <b>of</b> silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards <b>and</b> eastwards, towards <b>the</b> shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River.
<br>   They <b>had</b> gone some ten miles <b>and</b> noon <b>was</b> at hand when they came <b>on</b> a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. Before them lay a long lawn <b>of</b> shining grass, studded with golden elanor that glinted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. The lawn ran out <b>into</b> a narrow tongue between bright margins: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right <b>and</b> west <b>the</b> Silverlode flowed glittering; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left <b>and</b> east <b>the</b> Great River rolled its broad waters, deep <b>and</b> dark. On <b>the</b> further shores <b>the</b> woodlands still marched <b>on</b> southwards as far as <b>the</b> eye could see, <b>but</b> all <b>the</b> banks were bleak <b>and</b> bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> L?rien.
<br>   On <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, at some distance up from <b>the</b> meeting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> streams, there <b>was</b> a hythe <b>of</b> white stones <b>and</b> white wood. By <b>it</b> were moored many boats <b>and</b> barges. Some were brightly painted, <b>and</b> shone with silver <b>and</b> gold <b>and</b> green, <b>but</b> most were either white <b>or</b> grey. Three small grey boats <b>had</b> been made ready for <b>the</b> travellers, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> these <b>the</b> Elves stowed their goods. And they added also coils <b>of</b> rope, three <b>to</b> each boat. Slender they looked, <b>but</b> strong, silken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> touch, grey <b>of</b> hue like <b>the</b> elven-cloaks.
<br>   “What are these? “asked Sam, handling one that lay upon <b>the</b> greensward.
<br>   “Ropes indeed! “answered an Elf from <b>the</b> boats. “Never travel far <b>without</b> a rope! And one that <b>is</b> long <b>and</b> strong <b>and</b> light. Such are these. They may be a help <b>in</b> many needs.”
<br>   “You don't need <b>to</b> tell me that! “said Sam. “<b>I</b> came <b>without</b> any <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ve been worried ever since. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wondering <b>what</b> these were made <b>of</b>, knowing a bit about rope-making: <b>it</b>'s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family as you might say.”
<br>   “They are made <b>of</b> hithlain,” said <b>the</b> Elf, “<b>but</b> there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> time now <b>to</b> instruct you <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art <b>of</b> their making. Had we known that this craft delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May <b>it</b> serve you well!”
<br>   “Come! “said Haldir. “All <b>is</b> now ready for you. Enter <b>the</b> boats! But take care at first!”
<br>   “Heed <b>the</b> words! “said <b>the</b> other Elves. “These boats are light-built, <b>and</b> they are crafty <b>and</b> unlike <b>the</b> boats <b>of</b> other folk. They will not sink, lade them as you will; <b>but</b> they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves <b>to</b> stepping <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out, here where there <b>is</b> a landing-place, before you set off downstream.”
<br>   The Company <b>was</b> arranged <b>in</b> this way: Aragorn, Frodo, <b>and</b> Sam were <b>in</b> one boat; Boromir, Merry, <b>and</b> Pippin <b>in</b> another; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third were Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli, who <b>had</b> now become fast friends. In this last boat most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goods <b>and</b> packs were stowed. The boats were moved <b>and</b> steered with short-handled paddles that <b>had</b> broad leaf-shaped blades. When all <b>was</b> ready Aragorn led them <b>on</b> a trial up <b>the</b> Silverlode. The current <b>was</b> swift <b>and</b> they went forward slowly. Sam sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bows, clutching <b>the</b> sides, <b>and</b> looking back wistfully <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore. The sunlight glittering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond <b>the</b> green field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue, <b>the</b> trees drew down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river's brink. Here <b>and</b> there golden leaves tossed <b>and</b> floated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rippling stream. The air <b>was</b> <b>very</b> bright <b>and</b> still, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a silence, except for <b>the</b> high distant song <b>of</b> larks.
<br>   They turned a sharp bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, <b>and</b> there, sailing proudly down <b>the</b> stream toward them, they saw a swan <b>of</b> great size. The water rippled <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, <b>and</b> its eyes glinted like jet set <b>in</b> yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down <b>the</b> river as <b>it</b> drew nearer; <b>and</b> suddenly they perceived that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a ship, wrought <b>and</b> carved with elven-skill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> a bird. Two elves clad <b>in</b> white steered <b>it</b> with black paddles. In <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel sat Celeborn, <b>and</b> behind him stood Galadriel, tall <b>and</b> white; a circlet <b>of</b> golden flowers <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hair, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hand <b>she</b> held a harp, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> sang. Sad <b>and</b> sweet <b>was</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cool clear air:
<br>   
<br><b>I</b> sang <b>of</b> leaves, <b>of</b> leaves <b>of</b> gold, <b>and</b> leaves <b>of</b> gold there grew:
<br>Of wind <b>I</b> sang, a wind there came <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branches blew.
<br>Beyond <b>the</b> Sun, beyond <b>the</b> Moon, <b>the</b> foam <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sea,
<br>And <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strand <b>of</b> Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.
<br>Beneath <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> Ever-eve <b>in</b> Eldamar <b>it</b> shone,
<br>In Eldamar beside <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> Elven Tirion.
<br>There long <b>the</b> golden leaves have grown upon <b>the</b> branching years,
<br>While here beyond <b>the</b> Sundering Seas now fall <b>the</b> Elven-tears.
<br>O L?rien! The Winter comes, <b>the</b> bare <b>and</b> leafless Day;
<br>The leaves are falling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stream, <b>the</b> River flows away.
<br>O L?rien! Too long <b>I</b> have dwelt upon this Hither Shore
<br>And <b>in</b> a fading crown have twined <b>the</b> golden elanor.
<br>But if <b>of</b> ships <b>I</b> now should sing, <b>what</b> ship would come <b>to</b> me,
<br>What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?
<br>   
<br>   Aragorn stayed his boat as <b>the</b> Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended <b>her</b> song <b>and</b> greeted them. “We have come <b>to</b> bid you our last farewell,” <b>she</b> said, “<b>and</b> <b>to</b> speed you with blessings from our land.”
<br>   “Though you have been our guests,” said Celeborn, “you have not yet eaten with us, <b>and</b> we bid you, therefore, <b>to</b> a parting feast, here between <b>the</b> flowing waters that will bear you far from L?rien.”
<br>   The Swan passed <b>on</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hythe, <b>and</b> they turned their boats <b>and</b> followed <b>it</b>. There <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last end <b>of</b> Egladil upon <b>the</b> green grass <b>the</b> parting feast <b>was</b> held; <b>but</b> Frodo ate <b>and</b> drank little, heeding only <b>the</b> beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>and</b> <b>her</b> voice. She seemed <b>no</b> longer perilous <b>or</b> terrible, nor filled with hidden power. Already <b>she</b> seemed <b>to</b> him, as <b>by</b> men <b>of</b> later days Elves still at times are seen: present <b>and</b> yet remote, a living vision <b>of</b> that which has already been left far behind <b>by</b> <b>the</b> flowing streams <b>of</b> Time.
<br>   After they <b>had</b> eaten <b>and</b> drunk, <b>sitting</b> upon <b>the</b> grass, Celeborn spoke <b>to</b> them again <b>of</b> their journey, <b>and</b> lifting his hand he pointed south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woods beyond <b>the</b> Tongue.
<br>   “As you go down <b>the</b> water,” he said, “you will find that <b>the</b> trees will fail, <b>and</b> you will come <b>to</b> a barren country. There <b>the</b> River flows <b>in</b> stony vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tall island <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There <b>it</b> casts its arms about <b>the</b> steep shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isle, <b>and</b> falls then with a great noise <b>and</b> smoke over <b>the</b> cataracts <b>of</b> Rauros down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Nindalf, <b>the</b> Wetwang as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> called <b>in</b> your tongue. That <b>is</b> a wide region <b>of</b> sluggish fen where <b>the</b> stream becomes tortuous <b>and</b> much divided. There <b>the</b> Entwash flows <b>in</b> <b>by</b> many mouths from <b>the</b> Forest <b>of</b> Fangorn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west. About that stream, <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, lies Rohan. On <b>the</b> further side are <b>the</b> bleak hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil. The wind blows from <b>the</b> East there, for they look out over <b>the</b> Dead Marshes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Noman-lands <b>to</b> Cirith Gorgor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black gates <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   “Boromir, <b>and</b> any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will <b>do</b> well <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> Great River above Rauros <b>and</b> cross <b>the</b> Entwash before <b>it</b> finds <b>the</b> marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk becoming entangled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Forest <b>of</b> Fangorn. That <b>is</b> a strange land, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> now little known. But Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn doubtless <b>do</b> not need this warning.”
<br>   “Indeed we have heard <b>of</b> Fangorn <b>in</b> Minas Tirith,” said Boromir. “But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have heard seems <b>to</b> me for <b>the</b> most part old wives” tales, such as we tell <b>to</b> our children. All that lies north <b>of</b> Rohan <b>is</b> now <b>to</b> us so far away that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> our realm; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now many lives <b>of</b> men since any <b>of</b> us visited <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> prove <b>or</b> disprove <b>the</b> legends that have come down from distant years.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have myself been at whiles <b>in</b> Rohan, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have never crossed <b>it</b> northwards. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent out as a messenger, <b>I</b> passed through <b>the</b> Gap <b>by</b> <b>the</b> skirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains, <b>and</b> crossed <b>the</b> Isen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood <b>into</b> Northerland. A long <b>and</b> wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues <b>I</b> reckoned <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> took me many months; for <b>I</b> lost my horse at Tharbad, at <b>the</b> fording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greyflood. After that journey, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> road <b>I</b> have trodden with this Company, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not much doubt that <b>I</b> shall find a way through Rohan, <b>and</b> Fangorn too, if need be.”
<br>   “Then <b>I</b> need say <b>no</b> more,” said Celeborn. “But <b>do</b> not despise <b>the</b> lore that has come down from distant years; for oft <b>it</b> may chance that old wives keep <b>in</b> memory word <b>of</b> things that <b>once</b> were needful for <b>the</b> wise <b>to</b> know.”
<br>   Now Galadriel rose from <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> taking a cup from one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> maidens <b>she</b> filled <b>it</b> with white mead <b>and</b> gave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Celeborn.
<br>   “Now <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time <b>to</b> drink <b>the</b> cup <b>of</b> farewell,” <b>she</b> said. “Drink, Lord <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon, <b>and</b> already our evening draweth nigh.”
<br>   Then <b>she</b> brought <b>the</b> cup <b>to</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>and</b> bade them drink <b>and</b> farewell. But when they <b>had</b> drunk <b>she</b> commanded them <b>to</b> sit again <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, <b>and</b> chairs were set for <b>her</b> <b>and</b> for Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent about <b>her</b>, <b>and</b> a while <b>she</b> looked upon <b>her</b> guests. At last <b>she</b> spoke again.
<br>   “We have drunk <b>the</b> cup <b>of</b> parting,” <b>she</b> said, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadows fall between us. But before you go, <b>I</b> have brought <b>in</b> my ship gifts which <b>the</b> Lord <b>and</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim now offer you <b>in</b> memory <b>of</b> Lothl?rien.” Then <b>she</b> called <b>to</b> each <b>in</b> turn.
<br>   “Here <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gift <b>of</b> Celeborn <b>and</b> Galadriel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> leader <b>of</b> your Company,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> Aragorn, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> gave him a sheath that <b>had</b> been made <b>to</b> fit his sword. It <b>was</b> overlaid with a tracery <b>of</b> flowers <b>and</b> leaves wrought <b>of</b> silver <b>and</b> gold, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> were set <b>in</b> elven runes formed <b>of</b> many gems <b>the</b> name And?ril <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lineage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword.
<br>   “The blade that <b>is</b> drawn from this sheath shall not be stained <b>or</b> broken even <b>in</b> defeat,” <b>she</b> said. “But <b>is</b> there aught else that you desire <b>of</b> me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may be that we shall not meet again, unless <b>it</b> be far hence upon a road that has <b>no</b> returning.”
<br>   And Aragorn answered: “Lady, you know all my desire, <b>and</b> long held <b>in</b> keeping <b>the</b> only treasure that <b>I</b> seek. Yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not yours <b>to</b> give me, even if you would; <b>and</b> only through darkness shall <b>I</b> come <b>to</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,” said Galadriel; “for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> left <b>in</b> my care <b>to</b> be given <b>to</b> you, should you pass through this land.” Then <b>she</b> lifted from <b>her</b> lap a great stone <b>of</b> a clear green, set <b>in</b> a silver brooch that <b>was</b> wrought <b>in</b> <b>the</b> likeness <b>of</b> an eagle with outspread wings; <b>and</b> as <b>she</b> held <b>it</b> up <b>the</b> gem flashed like <b>the</b> sun shining through <b>the</b> leaves <b>of</b> spring. “This stone <b>I</b> gave <b>to</b> Celebr?an my daughter, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>to</b> hers; <b>and</b> now <b>it</b> comes <b>to</b> you as a token <b>of</b> hope. In this hour take <b>the</b> name that <b>was</b> foretold for you, Elessar, <b>the</b> Elfstone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> Elendil!”
<br>   Then Aragorn took <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> pinned <b>the</b> brooch upon his breast, <b>and</b> those who saw him wondered; for they <b>had</b> not marked before how tall <b>and</b> kingly he stood, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them that many years <b>of</b> toil <b>had</b> fallen from his shoulders. “For <b>the</b> gifts that you have given me <b>I</b> thank you,” he said, “O Lady <b>of</b> L?rien <b>of</b> whom were sprung Celebr?an <b>and</b> Arwen Evenstar. What praise could <b>I</b> say more?”
<br>   The Lady bowed <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> turned then <b>to</b> Boromir, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> him <b>she</b> gave a belt <b>of</b> gold; <b>and</b> <b>to</b> Merry <b>and</b> Pippin <b>she</b> gave small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas <b>she</b> gave a bow such as <b>the</b> Galadhrim used, longer <b>and</b> stouter than <b>the</b> bows <b>of</b> Mirkwood, <b>and</b> strung with a string <b>of</b> elf-hair. With <b>it</b> went a quiver <b>of</b> arrows.
<br>   “For you little gardener <b>and</b> lover <b>of</b> trees,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> Sam, “<b>I</b> have only a small gift.” She put <b>into</b> his hand a little box <b>of</b> plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon <b>the</b> lid. “Here <b>is</b> set G for Galadriel,” <b>she</b> said; “<b>but</b> also <b>it</b> may stand for garden <b>in</b> your tongue. In this box there <b>is</b> earth from my orchard, <b>and</b> such blessing as Galadriel has still <b>to</b> bestow <b>is</b> upon <b>it</b>. It will not keep you <b>on</b> your road, nor defend you against any peril; <b>but</b> if you keep <b>it</b> <b>and</b> see your home again at last, then perhaps <b>it</b> may reward you. Though you should find all barren <b>and</b> laid waste, there will be few gardens <b>in</b> Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel, <b>and</b> catch a glimpse far off <b>of</b> L?rien, that you have seen only <b>in</b> our winter. For our spring <b>and</b> our summer are gone <b>by</b>, <b>and</b> they will never be seen <b>on</b> earth again save <b>in</b> memory.”
<br>   Sam went red <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ears <b>and</b> muttered something inaudible, as he clutched <b>the</b> box <b>and</b> bowed as well as he could.
<br>   “And <b>what</b> gift would a Dwarf ask <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves? “said Galadriel turning <b>to</b> Gimli.
<br>   “None, Lady,” answered Gimli. “It <b>is</b> enough for me <b>to</b> have seen <b>the</b> Lady <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galadhrim, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> have heard <b>her</b> gentle words.”
<br>   “Hear all ye Elves! “<b>she</b> cried <b>to</b> those about <b>her</b>. “Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping <b>and</b> ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>, you desire something that <b>I</b> could give? Name <b>it</b>, <b>I</b> bid you! You shall not be <b>the</b> only guest <b>without</b> a gift.”
<br>   “There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b>, Lady Galadriel,” said Gimli, bowing low <b>and</b> stammering. “Nothing, unless <b>it</b> might be—unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> permitted <b>to</b> ask, nay, <b>to</b> name a single strand <b>of</b> your hair, which surpasses <b>the</b> gold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth as <b>the</b> stars surpass <b>the</b> gems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mine. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me <b>to</b> name my desire.”
<br>   The Elves stirred <b>and</b> murmured with astonishment, <b>and</b> Celeborn gazed at <b>the</b> Dwarf <b>in</b> wonder, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Lady smiled. “It <b>is</b> said that <b>the</b> skill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dwarves <b>is</b> <b>in</b> their hands rather than <b>in</b> their tongues “<b>she</b> said; “yet that <b>is</b> not true <b>of</b> Gimli. For none have ever made <b>to</b> me a request so bold <b>and</b> yet so courteous. And how shall <b>I</b> refuse, since <b>I</b> commanded him <b>to</b> speak? But tell me, <b>what</b> would you <b>do</b> with such a gift?”
<br>   “Treasure <b>it</b>, Lady,” he answered, “<b>in</b> memory <b>of</b> your words <b>to</b> me at our first meeting. And if ever <b>I</b> return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smithies <b>of</b> my home, <b>it</b> shall be set <b>in</b> imperishable crystal <b>to</b> be an heirloom <b>of</b> my house, <b>and</b> a pledge <b>of</b> good will between <b>the</b> Mountain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wood until <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> days.”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> Lady unbraided one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> long tresses, <b>and</b> cut off three golden hairs, <b>and</b> laid them <b>in</b> Gimli's hand. “These words shall go with <b>the</b> gift,” <b>she</b> said. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not foretell, for all foretelling <b>is</b> now vain: <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one hand lies darkness, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then <b>I</b> say <b>to</b> you, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>, that your hands shall flow with gold, <b>and</b> yet over you gold shall have <b>no</b> dominion.
<br>   “And you, Ring-bearer,” <b>she</b> said, turning <b>to</b> Frodo. “<b>I</b> come <b>to</b> you last who are not last <b>in</b> my thoughts. For you <b>I</b> have prepared this.” She held up a small crystal phial: <b>it</b> glittered as <b>she</b> moved <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> rays <b>of</b> white light sprang from <b>her</b> hand. “In this phial,” <b>she</b> said, “<b>is</b> caught <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> E?rendil's star, set amid <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night <b>is</b> about you. May <b>it</b> be a light <b>to</b> you <b>in</b> dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel <b>and</b> <b>her</b> Mirror!”
<br>   Frodo took <b>the</b> phial, <b>and</b> for a moment as <b>it</b> shone between them, he saw <b>her</b> again standing like a queen, great <b>and</b> beautiful, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> longer terrible. He bowed, <b>but</b> found <b>no</b> words <b>to</b> say.
<br>   Now <b>the</b> Lady arose, <b>and</b> Celeborn led them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hythe. A yellow noon lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> water glittered with silver. All at last <b>was</b> made ready. The Company took their places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boats as before. Crying farewell, <b>the</b> Elves <b>of</b> L?rien with long grey poles thrust them out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flowing stream, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rippling waters bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still <b>without</b> moving <b>or</b> speaking. On <b>the</b> green <b>bank</b> near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tongue <b>the</b> Lady Galadriel stood alone <b>and</b> silent. As they passed <b>her</b> they turned <b>and</b> their eyes watched <b>her</b> slowly floating away from them. For so <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> them: L?rien <b>was</b> slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing <b>on</b> <b>to</b> forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon <b>the</b> margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>and</b> leafless world.
<br>   Even as they gazed, <b>the</b> Silverlode passed out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> currents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, <b>and</b> their boats turned <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> speed southwards. Soon <b>the</b> white form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>was</b> small <b>and</b> distant. She shone like a window <b>of</b> glass upon a far hill <b>in</b> <b>the</b> westering sun, <b>or</b> as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land. Then <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> Frodo that <b>she</b> lifted <b>her</b> arms <b>in</b> a final farewell, <b>and</b> far <b>but</b> piercing-clear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following wind came <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice singing. But now <b>she</b> sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient tongue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves beyond <b>the</b> Sea, <b>and</b> he did not understand <b>the</b> words: fair <b>was</b> <b>the</b> music, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not comfort him.
<br>   Yet as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> Elvish words, they remained graven <b>in</b> his memory, <b>and</b> long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: <b>the</b> language <b>was</b> that <b>of</b> Elven-song <b>and</b> spoke <b>of</b> things little known <b>on</b> Middle-earth.

<br>   “Ah! like gold fall <b>the</b> leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, long years numberless as <b>the</b> wings <b>of</b> trees! The long years have passed like swift draughts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweet mead <b>in</b> lofty halls beyond <b>the</b> West, beneath <b>the</b> blue vaults <b>of</b> Varda wherein <b>the</b> stars tremble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> song <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice, holy <b>and</b> queenly.

Farewell! “Varda <b>is</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> that Lady whom <b>the</b> Elves <b>in</b> these lands <b>of</b> exile name Elbereth.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> River swept round a bend, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> banks rose upon either side, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> L?rien <b>was</b> hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came again.
<br>   The travellers now turned their faces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> journey; <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> before them, <b>and</b> their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. Gimli wept openly.
<br>   “<b>I</b> have looked <b>the</b> last upon that which <b>was</b> fairest,” he said <b>to</b> Legolas his companion. “Henceforward <b>I</b> will call <b>nothing</b> fair, unless <b>it</b> be <b>her</b> gift.” He put his hand <b>to</b> his breast.
<br>   “Tell me, Legolas, why did <b>I</b> come <b>on</b> this Quest? Little did <b>I</b> know where <b>the</b> chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not foresee <b>what</b> we might meet upon our road. Torment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>was</b> <b>the</b> danger that <b>I</b> feared, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> did not hold me back. But <b>I</b> would not have come, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> known <b>the</b> danger <b>of</b> light <b>and</b> joy. Now <b>I</b> have taken my worst wound <b>in</b> this parting, even if <b>I</b> were <b>to</b> go this night straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>!”
<br>   “Nay! “said Legolas. “Alas for us all! And for all that walk <b>the</b> world <b>in</b> these after-days. For such <b>is</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: <b>to</b> find <b>and</b> lose, as <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> those whose boat <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> running stream. But <b>I</b> count you blessed, Gimli son <b>of</b> Gl?<b>in</b>: for your loss you suffer <b>of</b> your own free will, <b>and</b> you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> least reward that you shall have <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> Lothl?rien shall remain ever clear <b>and</b> unstained <b>in</b> your heart, <b>and</b> shall neither fade nor grow stale.”
<br>   “Maybe,” said Gimli; “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort <b>is</b> cold. Memory <b>is</b> not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> heart desires. That <b>is</b> only a mirror, be <b>it</b> clear as Kheled-z?ram. Or so says <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> Gimli <b>the</b> Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed <b>I</b> have heard that for them memory <b>is</b> more like <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waking world than <b>to</b> a dream. Not so for Dwarves.
<br>   “But let us talk <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>. Look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boat! She <b>is</b> too low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water with all this baggage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River <b>is</b> swift. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish <b>to</b> drown my grief <b>in</b> cold water.” He took up a paddle, <b>and</b> steered towards <b>the</b> western <b>bank</b>, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which <b>had</b> already moved out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle stream.
<br>   So <b>the</b> Company went <b>on</b> their long way, down <b>the</b> wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either <b>bank</b>, <b>and</b> they could not see any glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lands behind. The breeze died away <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River flowed <b>without</b> a sound. No voice <b>of</b> bird broke <b>the</b> silence. The sun grew misty as <b>the</b> day grew old, until <b>it</b> gleamed <b>in</b> a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then <b>it</b> faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> West, <b>and</b> dusk came early, followed <b>by</b> a grey <b>and</b> starless night. Far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark quiet hours they floated <b>on</b>, guiding their boats under <b>the</b> overhanging shadows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western woods. Great trees passed <b>by</b> like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through <b>the</b> mist down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water. It <b>was</b> dreary <b>and</b> cold. Frodo sat <b>and</b> listened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faint lap <b>and</b> gurgle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River fretting among <b>the</b> tree-roots <b>and</b> driftwood near <b>the</b> shore, until his head nodded <b>and</b> he fell <b>into</b> an uneasy sleep.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 9
<br><b>THE</b> GREAT RIVER
<br>
<br>   Frodo <b>was</b> roused <b>by</b> Sam. He found that he <b>was</b> lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees <b>in</b> a quiet corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woodlands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great River, Anduin. He <b>had</b> slept <b>the</b> night away, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey <b>of</b> morning <b>was</b> dim among <b>the</b> bare branches. Gimli <b>was</b> busy with a small fire near at hand.
<br>   They started again before <b>the</b> day <b>was</b> broad. Not that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company were eager <b>to</b> hurry southwards: they were content that <b>the</b> decision, which they must make at latest when they came <b>to</b> Rauros <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; <b>and</b> they let <b>the</b> River bear them <b>on</b> at its own pace, <b>having</b> <b>no</b> desire <b>to</b> hasten towards <b>the</b> perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end. Aragorn let them drift with <b>the</b> stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness <b>to</b> come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day <b>and</b> journey <b>on</b> far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> evening; for he felt <b>in</b> his heart that time <b>was</b> pressing, <b>and</b> he feared that <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>had</b> not been idle while they lingered <b>in</b> L?rien.
<br>   Nonetheless they saw <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> an enemy that day, nor <b>the</b> next. The dull grey hours passed <b>without</b> event. As <b>the</b> third day <b>of</b> their voyage wore <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lands changed slowly: <b>the</b> trees thinned <b>and</b> then failed altogether. On <b>the</b> eastern <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up <b>and</b> away toward <b>the</b> sky; brown <b>and</b> withered they looked, as if fire <b>had</b> passed over them, leaving <b>no</b> living blade <b>of</b> green: an unfriendly waste <b>without</b> even a broken tree <b>or</b> a bold stone <b>to</b> relieve <b>the</b> emptiness. They <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Brown Lands that lay, vast <b>and</b> desolate, between Southern Mirkwood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil. What pestilence <b>or</b> war <b>or</b> evil deed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy <b>had</b> so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.
<br>   Upon <b>the</b> west <b>to</b> their right <b>the</b> land <b>was</b> treeless also, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flat, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> many places green with wide plains <b>of</b> grass. On this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River they passed forests <b>of</b> great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, as <b>the</b> little boats went rustling <b>by</b> along their fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent <b>and</b> tossed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light cold airs, hissing softly <b>and</b> sadly. Here <b>and</b> there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses <b>of</b> rolling meads, <b>and</b> far beyond them hills <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunset, <b>and</b> away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> sight a dark line, where marched <b>the</b> southernmost ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains.
<br>   There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many: small fowl whistling <b>and</b> piping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reeds, <b>but</b> they were seldom seen. Once <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> travellers heard <b>the</b> rush <b>and</b> whine <b>of</b> swan-wings, <b>and</b> looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along <b>the</b> sky.
<br>   “Swans! “said Sam. “And mighty big ones too!”
<br>   “Yes,” said Aragorn, “<b>and</b> they are black swans.”
<br>   “How wide <b>and</b> empty <b>and</b> mournful all this country looks! “said Frodo. “<b>I</b> always imagined that as one journeyed south <b>it</b> got warmer <b>and</b> merrier, until winter <b>was</b> left behind for ever.”
<br>   “But we have not journeyed far south yet,” answered Aragorn. “It <b>is</b> still winter, <b>and</b> we are far from <b>the</b> sea. Here <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> cold until <b>the</b> sudden spring, <b>and</b> we may yet have snow again. Far away down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Belfalas, <b>to</b> which Anduin runs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> warm <b>and</b> merry, maybe, <b>or</b> would be <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, <b>I</b> guess, south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southfarthing away <b>in</b> your Shire, hundreds <b>of</b> long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across <b>the</b> north plains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Riddermark, Rohan <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Limlight that runs down from Fangorn <b>to</b> join <b>the</b> Great River. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> north boundary <b>of</b> Rohan; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> old all that lay between Limlight <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Mountains belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rohirrim. It <b>is</b> a rich <b>and</b> pleasant land, <b>and</b> its grass has <b>no</b> rival; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> these evil days folk <b>do</b> not dwell <b>by</b> <b>the</b> River <b>or</b> ride often <b>to</b> its shores. Anduin <b>is</b> wide, yet <b>the</b> orcs can shoot their arrows far across <b>the</b> stream; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> late, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said, they have dared <b>to</b> cross <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> raid <b>the</b> herds <b>and</b> studs <b>of</b> Rohan.”
<br>   Sam looked from <b>bank</b> <b>to</b> <b>bank</b> uneasily. The trees <b>had</b> seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes <b>and</b> lurking dangers; now he wished that <b>the</b> trees were still there. He felt that <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> too naked, afloat <b>in</b> little open boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> shelterless lands, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> a river that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> frontier <b>of</b> war.
<br>   In <b>the</b> next day <b>or</b> two, as they went <b>on</b>, borne steadily southwards, this feeling <b>of</b> insecurity grew <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> Company. For a whole day they took <b>to</b> their paddles <b>and</b> hastened forward. The banks slid <b>by</b>. Soon <b>the</b> River broadened <b>and</b> grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon <b>the</b> east, <b>and</b> there were gravel-shoals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, so that careful steering <b>was</b> needed. The Brown Lands rose <b>into</b> bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from <b>the</b> East. On <b>the</b> other side <b>the</b> meads <b>had</b> become rolling downs <b>of</b> withered grass amidst a land <b>of</b> fen <b>and</b> tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawns <b>and</b> fountains, <b>the</b> clear sun <b>and</b> gentle rains <b>of</b> Lothl?rien. There <b>was</b> little speech <b>and</b> <b>no</b> laughter <b>in</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boats. Each member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> busy with his own thoughts.
<br>   The heart <b>of</b> Legolas <b>was</b> running under <b>the</b> stars <b>of</b> a summer night <b>in</b> some northern glade amid <b>the</b> beech-woods; Gimli <b>was</b> fingering gold <b>in</b> his mind, <b>and</b> wondering if <b>it</b> were fit <b>to</b> be wrought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> housing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady's gift. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering <b>to</b> himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness <b>or</b> doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle <b>and</b> driving <b>the</b> boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bow looking back, caught a queer gleam <b>in</b> his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam <b>had</b> long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he <b>had</b> been brought up <b>to</b> believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he <b>had</b> imagined. He <b>was</b> cramped <b>and</b> miserable, <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>but</b> stare at <b>the</b> winter-lands crawling <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey water <b>on</b> either side <b>of</b> him. Even when <b>the</b> paddles were <b>in</b> <b>use</b> they did not trust Sam with one.
<br>   As dusk drew down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth day, he <b>was</b> looking back over <b>the</b> bowed heads <b>of</b> Frodo <b>and</b> Aragorn <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following boats; he <b>was</b> drowsy <b>and</b> longed for camp <b>and</b> <b>the</b> feel <b>of</b> earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at <b>it</b> listlessly, then he sat up <b>and</b> rubbed his eyes; <b>but</b> when he looked again he could not see <b>it</b> any more.
<br>   That night they camped <b>on</b> a small eyot close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western <b>bank</b>. Sam lay rolled <b>in</b> blankets beside Frodo. “<b>I</b> <b>had</b> a funny dream an hour <b>or</b> two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,” he said. “Or maybe <b>it</b> wasn't a dream. Funny <b>it</b> <b>was</b> anyway.”
<br>   “Well, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b>? “said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he <b>had</b> told his tale, whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b>. “<b>I</b> haven't seen <b>or</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> anything <b>to</b> make me smile since we left Lothl?rien.”
<br>   “It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It <b>was</b> queer. All wrong, if <b>it</b> wasn't a dream. And you <b>had</b> best hear <b>it</b>. It <b>was</b> like this: <b>I</b> saw a log with eyes!”
<br>   “The log's all right,” said Frodo. “There are many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> River. But leave out <b>the</b> eyes!”
<br>   “That <b>I</b> won't,” said Sam. “Twas <b>the</b> eyes as made me sit up, so <b>to</b> speak. <b>I</b> saw <b>what</b> <b>I</b> took <b>to</b> be a log floating along <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-light behind Gimli's boat; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't give much heed <b>to</b> <b>it</b>. Then <b>it</b> seemed as if <b>the</b> log <b>was</b> slowly catching us up. And that <b>was</b> peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stream together. Just then <b>I</b> saw <b>the</b> eyes: two pale sort <b>of</b> points, shiny-like, <b>on</b> a hump at <b>the</b> near end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> log. What's more, <b>it</b> wasn't a log, for <b>it</b> <b>had</b> paddle-feet, like a swan's almost, only they seemed bigger, <b>and</b> kept dipping <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “That's when <b>I</b> sat right up <b>and</b> rubbed my eyes, meaning <b>to</b> give a shout, if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> still there when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> rubbed <b>the</b> drowse out <b>of</b> my head. For <b>the</b> whatever-<b>it</b>-<b>was</b> <b>was</b> coming along fast now <b>and</b> getting close behind Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving <b>and</b> staring, <b>or</b> whether <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> my senses, <b>I</b> don't know. When <b>I</b> looked again, <b>it</b> wasn't there. Yet <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> caught a glimpse with <b>the</b> tail <b>of</b>-my eye, as <b>the</b> saying <b>is</b>, <b>of</b> something dark shooting under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. <b>I</b> couldn't see <b>no</b> more eyes though.
<br>   “<b>I</b> said <b>to</b> myself: “dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,” <b>I</b> said: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said <b>no</b> more just then. But <b>I</b>'ve been thinking since. <b>and</b> now <b>I</b>'m not so sure. What <b>do</b> you make <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, Mr. Frodo?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> should make <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> a log <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dusk <b>and</b> sleep <b>in</b> your eyes Sam, said Frodo, if this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time that those eyes <b>had</b> been seen. But <b>it</b> isn't. <b>I</b> saw them away back north before we reached L?rien. And <b>I</b> saw a strange creature with eyes climbing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flet that night. Haldir saw <b>it</b> too. And <b>do</b> you remember <b>the</b> report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves that went after <b>the</b> orc-band?”
<br>   “Ah,” said Sam. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b>; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> remember more too. <b>I</b> don't like my thoughts; <b>but</b> thinking <b>of</b> one thing <b>and</b> another, <b>and</b> Mr. Bilbo's stories <b>and</b> all, <b>I</b> fancy <b>I</b> could put a name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> creature, at a guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?”
<br>   “Yes, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have feared for some time,” said Frodo. “Ever since <b>the</b> night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flet. <b>I</b> suppose he <b>was</b> lurking <b>in</b> Moria, <b>and</b> picked up our trail then; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> hoped that our stay <b>in</b> L?rien would throw him off <b>the</b> scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Silverlode, watching us start off!”
<br>   “That's about <b>it</b>,” said Sam. “And we'd better be a bit more watchful ourselves, <b>or</b> we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one <b>of</b> these nights, if we ever wake up <b>to</b> feel anything. And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> leading up <b>to</b>. No need <b>to</b> trouble Strider <b>or</b> <b>the</b> others tonight. <b>I</b>'ll keep watch. <b>I</b> can sleep tomorrow, being <b>no</b> more than luggage <b>in</b> a boat, as you might say.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> might,” said Frodo, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> might say “luggage with eyes". You shall watch; <b>but</b> only if you promise <b>to</b> wake me halfway towards morning, if <b>nothing</b> happens before then.”
<br>   In <b>the</b> dead hours Frodo came out <b>of</b> a deep dark sleep <b>to</b> find Sam shaking him. “It's a shame <b>to</b> wake you,” whispered Sam, “<b>but</b> that's <b>what</b> you said. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> tell, <b>or</b> not much. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> heard some soft plashing <b>and</b> a sniffing noise, a while back; <b>but</b> you hear a lot <b>of</b> such queer sounds <b>by</b> a river at night.”
<br>   He lay down, <b>and</b> Frodo sat up, huddled <b>in</b> his blankets, <b>and</b> fought off his sleep. Minutes <b>or</b> hours passed slowly, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> happened. Frodo <b>was</b> just yielding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> temptation <b>to</b> lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as <b>it</b> shot out <b>and</b> grabbed <b>the</b> gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, <b>and</b> then they lifted <b>and</b> gazed up at Frodo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eyot. They were not more than a yard <b>or</b> two away, <b>and</b> Frodo heard <b>the</b> soft hiss <b>of</b> intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, <b>and</b> faced <b>the</b> eyes. Immediately their light <b>was</b> shut off. There <b>was</b> another hiss <b>and</b> a splash, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> dark log-shape shot away downstream <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night. Aragorn stirred <b>in</b> his sleep, turned over, <b>and</b> sat up`
<br>   “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>? “he whispered, springing up <b>and</b> coming <b>to</b> Frodo. “<b>I</b> felt something <b>in</b> my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword?”
<br>   “Gollum,” answered Frodo. “Or at least, so <b>I</b> guess.”
<br>   “Ah! “said Aragorn. “So you know about our little footpad, <b>do</b> you? He padded after us all through Moria <b>and</b> right down <b>to</b> Nimrodel. Since we took <b>to</b> boats, he has been lying <b>on</b> a log <b>and</b> paddling with hands <b>and</b> feet. <b>I</b> have tried <b>to</b> catch him <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> at night; <b>but</b> he <b>is</b> slier than a fox, <b>and</b> as slippery as a fish. <b>I</b> hoped <b>the</b> river-voyage would beat him, <b>but</b> he <b>is</b> too clever a waterman.
<br>   “We shall have <b>to</b> try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will keep watch for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could lay my hands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wretch. We might make him useful. But if <b>I</b> cannot, we shall have <b>to</b> try <b>and</b> lose him. He <b>is</b> <b>very</b> dangerous. Quite apart from murder <b>by</b> night <b>on</b> his own account, he may put any enemy that <b>is</b> about <b>on</b> our track.”
<br>   The night passed <b>without</b> Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. After that <b>the</b> Company kept a sharp look-out, <b>but</b> they saw <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> Gollum while <b>the</b> voyage lasted. If he <b>was</b> still following, he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> wary <b>and</b> cunning. At Aragorn's bidding they paddled now for long spells, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> banks went swiftly <b>by</b>. But they saw little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, for they journeyed mostly <b>by</b> night <b>and</b> twilight, resting <b>by</b> day, <b>and</b> lying as hidden as <b>the</b> land allowed. In this way <b>the</b> time passed <b>without</b> event until <b>the</b> seventh day.
<br>   The weather <b>was</b> still grey <b>and</b> overcast, with wind from <b>the</b> East, <b>but</b> as evening drew <b>into</b> night <b>the</b> sky away westward cleared, <b>and</b> pools <b>of</b> faint light, yellow <b>and</b> pale green, opened under <b>the</b> grey shores <b>of</b> cloud. There <b>the</b> white rind <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Moon could be seen glimmering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remote lakes. Sam looked at <b>it</b> <b>and</b> puckered his brows.
<br>   The next day <b>the</b> country <b>on</b> either side began <b>to</b> change rapidly. The banks began <b>to</b> rise <b>and</b> grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> both shores there were steep slopes buried <b>in</b> deep brakes <b>of</b> thorn <b>and</b> sloe, tangled with brambles <b>and</b> creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, <b>and</b> chimneys <b>of</b> grey weathered stone dark with ivy; <b>and</b> beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grey hill-country <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil, <b>the</b> southern march <b>of</b> Wilderland.
<br>   There were many birds about <b>the</b> cliffs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rock-chimneys, <b>and</b> all day high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air flocks <b>of</b> birds <b>had</b> been circling, black against <b>the</b> pale sky. As they lay <b>in</b> their camp that day Aragorn watched <b>the</b> flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum <b>had</b> been doing some mischief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> news <b>of</b> their voyage <b>was</b> now moving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. Later as <b>the</b> sun <b>was</b> setting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Company <b>was</b> stirring <b>and</b> getting ready <b>to</b> start again, he descried a dark spot against <b>the</b> fading light: a great bird high <b>and</b> far off, now wheeling, now flying <b>on</b> slowly southwards.
<br>   “What <b>is</b> that, Legolas? “he asked, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern sky. “Is <b>it</b>, as <b>I</b> think. an eagle?”
<br>   “Yes.” said Legolas. “It <b>is</b> an eagle, a hunting eagle. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> that forebodes. It <b>is</b> far from <b>the</b> mountains.”
<br>   “We will not start until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fully dark,” said Aragorn.
<br>   The eighth night <b>of</b> their journey came. It <b>was</b> silent <b>and</b> windless; <b>the</b> grey east wind <b>had</b> passed away. The thin crescent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon <b>had</b> fallen early <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pale sunset, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> clear above, <b>and</b> though far away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South there were great ranges <b>of</b> cloud that still shone faintly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West stars glinted bright.
<br>   “Come! “said Aragorn. “We will venture one more journey <b>by</b> night. We are coming <b>to</b> reaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know well: for <b>I</b> have never journeyed <b>by</b> water <b>in</b> these parts before, not between here <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rapids <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir. But if <b>I</b> am right <b>in</b> my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks <b>and</b> stony eyots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stream. We must keep a sharp watch <b>and</b> not try <b>to</b> paddle swiftly.”
<br>   To Sam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leading boat <b>was</b> given <b>the</b> task <b>of</b> watchman. He lay forward peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom. The night grew dark, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> stars above were strangely bright, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> a glimmer On <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. It <b>was</b> close <b>on</b> midnight, <b>and</b> they <b>had</b> been drifting for some while. hardly using <b>the</b> paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stream <b>and</b> he heard <b>the</b> swirl <b>of</b> racing water. There <b>was</b> a swift current which swung left, towards <b>the</b> eastern shore where <b>the</b> channel <b>was</b> clear. As they were swept aside <b>the</b> travellers could see, now <b>very</b> close, <b>the</b> pale foam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream like a ridge <b>of</b> teeth. The boats were all huddled together.
<br>   “Hoy there, Aragorn! “shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> leader. “This <b>is</b> madness! We cannot dare <b>the</b> Rapids <b>by</b> night! But <b>no</b> boat can live <b>in</b> Sarn Gebir, be <b>it</b> night <b>or</b> day.”
<br>   “Back, back! “cried Aragorn. “Turn! Turn if you can! “He drove his paddle <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, trying <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> boat <b>and</b> bring <b>it</b> round.
<br>   “<b>I</b> am out <b>of</b> my reckoning,” he said <b>to</b> Frodo. “<b>I</b> did not know that we <b>had</b> come so far: Anduin flows faster than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b>. Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.”
<br>   With great efforts they checked <b>the</b> boats <b>and</b> slowly brought them about; <b>but</b> at first they could make only small headway against <b>the</b> current, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> time they were carried nearer <b>and</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>bank</b>. Now dark <b>and</b> ominous <b>it</b> loomed up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night.
<br>   “All together, paddle! “shouted Boromir. “Paddle! Or we shall be driven <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoals.” Even as he spoke Frodo felt <b>the</b> keel beneath him grate upon stone.
<br>   At that moment there <b>was</b> a twang <b>of</b> bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, <b>and</b> some fell among them. One smote Frodo between <b>the</b> shoulders <b>and</b> he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> arrow fell back. foiled <b>by</b> his hidden coat <b>of</b> mail. Another passed through Aragorn's hood; <b>and</b> a third stood fast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gunwale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second boat, close <b>by</b> Merry's hand. Sam <b>thought</b> he could glimpse black figures running <b>to</b> <b>and</b> fro upon <b>the</b> long shingle-banks that lay under <b>the</b> eastern shore. They seemed <b>very</b> near.
<br>   “Yrch!” said Legolas, falling <b>into</b> his own tongue.
<br>   “Orcs! “cried Gimli.
<br>   “Gollum's doing, <b>I</b>'ll be bound.” said Sam <b>to</b> Frodo. “And a nice place <b>to</b> choose, too. The River seems set <b>on</b> taking us right <b>into</b> their arms!”
<br>   They all leaned forward straining at <b>the</b> paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they expected <b>to</b> feel <b>the</b> bite <b>of</b> black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead <b>or</b> struck <b>the</b> water nearby; <b>but</b> there were <b>no</b> more hits. It <b>was</b> dark, <b>but</b> not too dark for <b>the</b> night-eyes <b>of</b> Orcs, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> grey cloaks Of L?rien <b>and</b> <b>the</b> grey timber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elf-wrought boats defeated <b>the</b> malice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archers <b>of</b> Mordor.
<br>   Stroke <b>by</b> stroke they laboured <b>on</b>. In <b>the</b> darkness <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hard <b>to</b> be sure that they were indeed moving at all; <b>but</b> slowly <b>the</b> swirl <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water grew less, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern <b>bank</b> faded back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night. At last, as far as they could judge, they <b>had</b> reached <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream again <b>and</b> <b>had</b> driven their boats back some distance above <b>the</b> jutting rocks. Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards <b>the</b> western shore. Under <b>the</b> shadow Of bushes leaning out over <b>the</b> water they halted <b>and</b> drew breath.
<br>   Legolas laid down his paddle <b>and</b> took up <b>the</b> bow that he <b>had</b> brought from L?rien. Then he sprang ashore <b>and</b> climbed a few paces up <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. Stringing <b>the</b> bow <b>and</b> fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over <b>the</b> River <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness. Across <b>the</b> water there were shrill cries, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> could be seen.
<br>   Frodo looked up at <b>the</b> Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night, seeking a mark <b>to</b> shoot at. His head <b>was</b> dark, crowned with sharp white stars that glittered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> black pools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky behind. But now rising <b>and</b> sailing up from <b>the</b> South <b>the</b> great clouds advanced, sending out dark outriders <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starry fields. A sudden dread fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “Elbereth Gilthoniel!” sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud <b>and</b> yet not a cloud, for <b>it</b> moved far more swiftly, came out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blackness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South, <b>and</b> sped towards <b>the</b> Company, blotting out all light as <b>it</b> approached. Soon <b>it</b> appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than <b>the</b> pits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. Fierce voices rose up <b>to</b> greet <b>it</b> from across <b>the</b> water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him <b>and</b> clutching at his heart; there <b>was</b> a deadly cold, like <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> an old wound, <b>in</b> his shoulder. He crouched down, as if <b>to</b> hide.
<br>   Suddenly <b>the</b> great bow <b>of</b> L?rien sang. Shrill went <b>the</b> arrow from <b>the</b> elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him <b>the</b> winged shape swerved. There <b>was</b> a harsh croaking scream, as <b>it</b> fell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air, vanishing down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore. The sky <b>was</b> clean again. There <b>was</b> a tumult <b>of</b> many voices far away, cursing <b>and</b> wailing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness, <b>and</b> then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from <b>the</b> east that night.
<br>   After a while Aragorn led <b>the</b> boats back upstream. They felt their way along <b>the</b> water's edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> behind them rose a steep rocky <b>bank</b>. Here <b>the</b> Company decided <b>to</b> stay <b>and</b> await <b>the</b> dawn: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> useless <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> move further <b>by</b> night. They made <b>no</b> camp <b>and</b> lit <b>no</b> fire, <b>but</b> lay huddled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boats, moored close together.
<br>   “Praised be <b>the</b> bow <b>of</b> Galadriel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>and</b> eye <b>of</b> Legolas! “said Gimli, as he munched a wafer <b>of</b> lembas. “That <b>was</b> a mighty shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, my friend!”
<br>   “But who can say <b>what</b> <b>it</b> hit?” said Legolas.
<br>   “<b>I</b> cannot,” said Gimli. “But <b>I</b> am glad that <b>the</b> shadow came <b>no</b> nearer. <b>I</b> liked <b>it</b> not at all. Too much <b>it</b> reminded me <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shadow <b>in</b> Moria—<b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Balrog,” he ended <b>in</b> a whisper.
<br>   “It <b>was</b> not a Balrog,” said Frodo, still shivering with <b>the</b> chill that <b>had</b> come upon him. “It <b>was</b> something colder. <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> –” Then he paused <b>and</b> fell silent.
<br>   “What <b>do</b> you think? “asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> catch a glimpse <b>of</b> Frodo's face.
<br>   “<b>I</b> think—No, <b>I</b> will not say,” answered Frodo. “Whatever <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, its fall has dismayed our enemies.”
<br>   “So <b>it</b> seems,” said Aragorn. “Yet where they are, <b>and</b> how many, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they will <b>do</b> next, we <b>do</b> not know. This night we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But <b>what</b> <b>the</b> day will show who can tell? Have your weapons close <b>to</b> hand!”
<br>   Sam sat tapping <b>the</b> hilt <b>of</b> his sword as if he were counting <b>on</b> his fingers, <b>and</b> looking up at <b>the</b> sky. “It's <b>very</b> strange,” he murmured. “The Moon's <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>and</b> <b>in</b> Wilderland, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be. But either <b>it</b>'s out <b>of</b> its running, <b>or</b> <b>I</b>'m all wrong <b>in</b> my reckoning. You'll remember, Mr. Frodo, <b>the</b> Moon <b>was</b> waning as we lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flet up <b>in</b> that tree: a week from <b>the</b> full, <b>I</b> reckon. And we'd been a week <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we <b>had</b> never stayed <b>no</b> time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elvish country.
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> can remember three nights there for certain, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> seem <b>to</b> remember several more, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> would take my oath <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never a whole month. Anyone would think that time did not count <b>in</b> there!”
<br>   “And perhaps that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>it</b>,” said Frodo. “In that land, maybe, we were <b>in</b> a time that has elsewhere long gone <b>by</b>. It <b>was</b> not, <b>I</b> think, until Silverlode bore us back <b>to</b> Anduin that we returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time that flows through mortal lands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Sea. And <b>I</b> don't remember any moon, either new <b>or</b> old, <b>in</b> Caras Galadhon: only stars <b>by</b> night <b>and</b> sun <b>by</b> day.”
<br>   Legolas stirred <b>in</b> his boat. “Nay, time does not tarry ever,” he said; “<b>but</b> change <b>and</b> growth <b>is</b> not <b>in</b> all things <b>and</b> places alike. For <b>the</b> Elves <b>the</b> world moves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> moves both <b>very</b> swift <b>and</b> <b>very</b> slow. Swift, because they themselves change little, <b>and</b> all else fleets <b>by</b>: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a grief <b>to</b> them. Slow, because they <b>do</b> not count <b>the</b> running years, not for themselves. The passing seasons are <b>but</b> ripples ever repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long long stream. Yet beneath <b>the</b> Sun all things must wear <b>to</b> an end at last.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> wearing <b>is</b> slow <b>in</b> L?rien,” said Frodo. “The power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b>. Rich are <b>the</b> hours, though short they seem, <b>in</b> Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields <b>the</b> Elven-ring.”
<br>   “That should not have been said outside L?rien, not even <b>to</b> me,” said Aragorn. “Speak <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b>! But so <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, Sam: <b>in</b> that land you lost your count. There time flowed swiftly <b>by</b> us, as for <b>the</b> Elves. The old moon passed, <b>and</b> a new moon waxed <b>and</b> waned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world outside, while we tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter <b>is</b> nearly gone. Time flows <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a spring <b>of</b> little hope.”
<br>   The night passed silently. No voice <b>or</b> call <b>was</b> heard again across <b>the</b> water. The travellers huddled <b>in</b> their boats felt <b>the</b> changing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weather. The air grew warm <b>and</b> <b>very</b> still under <b>the</b> great moist clouds that <b>had</b> floated up from <b>the</b> South <b>and</b> <b>the</b> distant seas. The rushing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River over <b>the</b> rocks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapids seemed <b>to</b> grow louder <b>and</b> closer. The twigs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees above them began <b>to</b> drip.
<br>   When <b>the</b> day came <b>the</b> mood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world about them <b>had</b> become soft <b>and</b> sad. Slowly <b>the</b> dawn grew <b>to</b> a pale light, diffused <b>and</b> shadowless. There <b>was</b> mist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> white fog swathed <b>the</b> shore; <b>the</b> far <b>bank</b> could not be seen.
<br>   “<b>I</b> can't abide fog,” said Sam; “<b>but</b> this seems <b>to</b> be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can <b>get</b> away <b>without</b> those cursed goblins seeing us.”
<br>   “Perhaps so,” said Aragorn. “But <b>it</b> will be hard <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> path unless <b>the</b> fog lifts a little later <b>on</b>. And we must find <b>the</b> path, if we are <b>to</b> pass Sarn Gebir <b>and</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see why we should pass <b>the</b> Rapids <b>or</b> follow <b>the</b> River any further,” said Boromir. “If <b>the</b> Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon these cockle-boats, <b>and</b> strike westward <b>and</b> southward, until we come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Entwash <b>and</b> cross <b>into</b> my own land.”
<br>   “We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,” said Aragorn, “<b>but</b> that <b>is</b> not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than <b>it</b> sounds. The vale <b>of</b> Entwash <b>is</b> flat <b>and</b> fenny, <b>and</b> fog <b>is</b> a deadly peril there for those <b>on</b> foot <b>and</b> laden. <b>I</b> would not abandon our boats until we must. The River <b>is</b> at least a path that cannot be missed.”
<br>   “But <b>the</b> Enemy holds <b>the</b> eastern <b>bank</b>,” objected Boromir. “And even if you pass <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Argonath <b>and</b> come unmolested <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tindrock, <b>what</b> will you <b>do</b> then? Leap down <b>the</b> Falls <b>and</b> land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marshes?”
<br>   “No! “answered Aragorn. “Say rather that we will bear our boats <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ancient way <b>to</b> Rauros-foot, <b>and</b> there take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water again. Do you not know, Boromir, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> you choose <b>to</b> forget <b>the</b> North Stair, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great kings? <b>I</b> at least have a mind <b>to</b> stand <b>in</b> that high place again, before <b>I</b> decide my further course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.”
<br>   Boromir held out long against this choice; <b>but</b> when <b>it</b> became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave <b>in</b>. “It <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Minas Tirith <b>to</b> desert their friends at need,” he said, “<b>and</b> you will need my strength, if ever you are <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> Tindrock. To <b>the</b> tall isle <b>I</b> will go, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> further. There <b>I</b> shall turn <b>to</b> my home, alone if my help has not earned <b>the</b> reward <b>of</b> any companionship.”
<br>   The day <b>was</b> now growing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fog <b>had</b> lifted a little. It <b>was</b> decided that Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas should at <b>once</b> go forward along <b>the</b> shore, while <b>the</b> others remained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> boats. Aragorn hoped <b>to</b> find some way <b>by</b> which they could carry both their boats <b>and</b> their baggage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> smoother water beyond <b>the</b> Rapids.
<br>   “Boats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves would not sink, maybe,” he said, “<b>but</b> that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so yet. No road <b>was</b> made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> Gondor <b>in</b> this region, for even <b>in</b> their great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond <b>the</b> Emyn Muil; <b>but</b> there <b>is</b> a portage-way somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western shore, if <b>I</b> can find <b>it</b>. It cannot yet have perished; for light boats used <b>to</b> journey out <b>of</b> Wilderland down <b>to</b> Osgiliath, <b>and</b> still did so until a few years ago, when <b>the</b> Orcs <b>of</b> Mordor began <b>to</b> multiply.”
<br>   “Seldom <b>in</b> my life has any boat come out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Orcs prowl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east-shore,” said Boromir. “If you go forward, peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path.”
<br>   “Peril lies ahead <b>on</b> every southward road,” answered Aragorn. “Wait for us one day. If we <b>do</b> not return <b>in</b> that time, you will know that evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader <b>and</b> follow him as best you can.”
<br>   It <b>was</b> with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn <b>and</b> Legolas climb <b>the</b> steep <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> vanish <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mists; <b>but</b> his fears proved groundless. Only two <b>or</b> three hours <b>had</b> passed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> barely mid-day, when <b>the</b> shadowy shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explorers appeared again.
<br>   “All <b>is</b> well,” said Aragorn, as he clambered down <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. “There <b>is</b> a track, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> leads <b>to</b> a good landing that <b>is</b> still serviceable. The distance <b>is</b> not great: <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rapids <b>is</b> <b>but</b> half a mile below us, <b>and</b> they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them <b>the</b> stream becomes clear <b>and</b> smooth again, though <b>it</b> runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our boats <b>and</b> baggage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old portage-way. We have found <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> lies well back from <b>the</b> water-side here, <b>and</b> runs under <b>the</b> lee <b>of</b> a rock-wall, a furlong <b>or</b> more from <b>the</b> shore. We did not find where <b>the</b> northward landing lies. If <b>it</b> still remains, we must have passed <b>it</b> yesterday night. We might labour far upstream <b>and</b> yet miss <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fog. <b>I</b> fear we must leave <b>the</b> River now, <b>and</b> make for <b>the</b> portage-way as best we can from here.”
<br>   “That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,” said Boromir.
<br>   “Yet such as we are we will try <b>it</b>,” said Aragorn.
<br>   “Aye, we will,” said Gimli. “The legs <b>of</b> Men will lag <b>on</b> a rough road, while a Dwarf goes <b>on</b>, be <b>the</b> burden <b>twice</b> his own weight, Master Boromir!”
<br>   The task proved hard indeed, yet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done. The goods were taken out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boats <b>and</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, where there <b>was</b> a level space. Then <b>the</b> boats were drawn out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water <b>and</b> carried up. They were far less heavy than any <b>had</b> expected. Of <b>what</b> tree growing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>was</b> tough <b>and</b> yet strangely light. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along <b>the</b> flat. Nonetheless <b>it</b> needed <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Men <b>to</b> lift <b>and</b> haul them over <b>the</b> ground that <b>the</b> Company now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cross. It sloped up away from <b>the</b> River, a tumbled waste <b>of</b> grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds <b>and</b> bushes; there were thickets <b>of</b> brambles, <b>and</b> sheer dells; <b>and</b> here <b>and</b> there boggy pools fed <b>by</b> waters trickling from <b>the</b> terraces further inland.
<br>   One <b>by</b> one Boromir <b>and</b> Aragorn carried <b>the</b> boats, while <b>the</b> others toiled <b>and</b> scrambled after them with <b>the</b> baggage. At last all <b>was</b> removed <b>and</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars <b>and</b> many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung <b>in</b> veils upon <b>the</b> crumbling rock-wall, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> their left mist shrouded <b>the</b> River: they could hear <b>it</b> rushing <b>and</b> foaming over <b>the</b> sharp shelves <b>and</b> stony teeth <b>of</b> Sarn Gebir, <b>but</b> they could not see <b>it</b>. Twice they made <b>the</b> journey, before all <b>was</b> brought safe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern landing.
<br>   There <b>the</b> portage-way, turning back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water-side, ran gently down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shallow edge <b>of</b> a little pool. It seemed <b>to</b> have been scooped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river-side, not <b>by</b> hand, <b>but</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier <b>of</b> rock that jutted out some way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stream. Beyond <b>it</b> <b>the</b> shore rose sheer <b>into</b> a grey cliff, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> further passage for those <b>on</b> foot.
<br>   Already <b>the</b> short afternoon <b>was</b> past, <b>and</b> a dim cloudy dusk <b>was</b> closing <b>in</b>. They sat beside <b>the</b> water listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confused rush <b>and</b> roar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rapids hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mist; they were <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> sleepy, <b>and</b> their hearts were as gloomy as <b>the</b> dying day.
<br>   “Well, here we are, <b>and</b> here we must pass another night,” said Boromir. “We need sleep, <b>and</b> even if Aragorn <b>had</b> a mind <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> Gates <b>of</b> Argonath <b>by</b> night, we are all too <b>tired</b>-except, <b>no</b> doubt, our sturdy dwarf.”
<br>   Gimli made <b>no</b> reply: he <b>was</b> nodding as he sat.
<br>   “Let us rest as much as we can now,” said Aragorn. “Tomorrow we must journey <b>by</b> day again. Unless <b>the</b> weather changes <b>once</b> more <b>and</b> cheats us, we shall have a good chance <b>of</b> slipping through, unseen <b>by</b> any eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together <b>in</b> turns: three hours off <b>and</b> one <b>on</b> guard.”
<br>   Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle <b>of</b> rain an hour before dawn. As soon as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fully light they started. Already <b>the</b> fog <b>was</b> thinning. They kept as close as they could <b>to</b> <b>the</b> western side, <b>and</b> they could see <b>the</b> dim shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hurrying river. In <b>the</b> mid-morning <b>the</b> clouds drew down lower, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> began <b>to</b> rain heavily. They drew <b>the</b> skin-covers over their boats <b>to</b> prevent them from being flooded, <b>and</b> drifted <b>on</b>: little could be seen before them <b>or</b> about them through <b>the</b> grey falling curtains.
<br>   The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly <b>the</b> sky above grew lighter, <b>and</b> then suddenly <b>the</b> clouds broke, <b>and</b> their draggled fringes trailed away northward up <b>the</b> River. The fogs <b>and</b> mists were gone. Before <b>the</b> travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides <b>to</b> which clung, upon shelves <b>and</b> <b>in</b> narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope <b>of</b> stopping <b>or</b> turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them <b>was</b> a lane <b>of</b> pale-blue sky, around them <b>the</b> dark overshadowed River, <b>and</b> before them black, shutting out <b>the</b> sun, <b>the</b> hills <b>of</b> Emyn Muil, <b>in</b> which <b>no</b> opening could be seen.
<br>   Frodo peering forward saw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles <b>or</b> pillars <b>of</b> stone they seemed. Tall <b>and</b> sheer <b>and</b> ominous they stood upon either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream. A narrow gap appeared between them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River swept <b>the</b> boats towards <b>it</b>.
<br>   “Behold <b>the</b> Argonath, <b>the</b> Pillars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kings! “cried Aragorn. “We shall pass them soon. Keep <b>the</b> boats <b>in</b> line, <b>and</b> as far apart as you can! Hold <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stream!”
<br>   As Frodo <b>was</b> borne towards them <b>the</b> great pillars rose like towers <b>to</b> meet him. Giants they seemed <b>to</b> him, vast grey figures silent <b>but</b> threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped <b>and</b> fashioned: <b>the</b> craft <b>and</b> power <b>of</b> old <b>had</b> wrought upon them, <b>and</b> still they preserved through <b>the</b> suns <b>and</b> rains <b>of</b> forgotten years <b>the</b> mighty likenesses <b>in</b> which they <b>had</b> been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deep waters stood two great kings <b>of</b> stone: still with blurred eyes <b>and</b> crannied brows they frowned upon <b>the</b> North. The left hand <b>of</b> each <b>was</b> raised palm outwards <b>in</b> gesture <b>of</b> warning; <b>in</b> each right hand there <b>was</b> an axe; upon each head there <b>was</b> a crumbling helm <b>and</b> crown. Great power <b>and</b> majesty they still wore, <b>the</b> silent wardens <b>of</b> a long-vanished kingdom. Awe <b>and</b> fear fell upon Frodo, <b>and</b> he cowered down, shutting his eyes <b>and</b> not daring <b>to</b> look up as <b>the</b> boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as <b>the</b> boats whirled <b>by</b>. frail <b>and</b> fleeting as little leaves, under <b>the</b> enduring shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentinels <b>of</b> N?menor. So they passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark chasm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gates.
<br>   Sheer rose <b>the</b> dreadful cliffs <b>to</b> unguessed heights <b>on</b> either side. Far off <b>was</b> <b>the</b> dim sky. The black waters roared <b>and</b> echoed, <b>and</b> a wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam <b>in</b> front muttering <b>and</b> groaning: “What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> this boat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ll never wet my toes <b>in</b> a puddle again, let alone a river!”
<br>   “Fear not! “said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned <b>and</b> saw Strider, <b>and</b> yet not Strider; for <b>the</b> weatherworn Ranger <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer there. In <b>the</b> stern sat Aragorn son <b>of</b> Arathorn, proud <b>and</b> erect, guiding <b>the</b> boat with skilful strokes; his hood <b>was</b> cast back, <b>and</b> his dark hair <b>was</b> blowing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, a light <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes: a king returning from exile <b>to</b> his own land.
<br>   “Fear not! “he said. “Long have <b>I</b> desired <b>to</b> look upon <b>the</b> likenesses <b>of</b> Isildur <b>and</b> An?rion, my sires <b>of</b> old. Under their shadow Elessar, <b>the</b> Elfstone son <b>of</b> Arathorn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Valandil Isildur's son heir <b>of</b> Elendil, has nought <b>to</b> dread!”
<br>   Then <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> his eyes faded, <b>and</b> he spoke <b>to</b> himself: “Would that Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> my own city! But whither now shall <b>I</b> go?”
<br>   The chasm <b>was</b> long <b>and</b> dark, <b>and</b> filled with <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> wind <b>and</b> rushing water <b>and</b> echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards <b>the</b> west so that at first all <b>was</b> dark ahead; <b>but</b> soon Frodo saw a tall gap <b>of</b> light before him, ever growing. Swiftly <b>it</b> drew near, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>the</b> boats shot through, out <b>into</b> a wide clear light.
<br>   The sun, already long fallen from <b>the</b> noon, <b>was</b> shining <b>in</b> a windy sky. The pent waters spread out <b>into</b> a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced <b>by</b> steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, <b>but</b> their heads were bare, cold-gleaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. At <b>the</b> far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from <b>the</b> others <b>and</b> sundered from them, an island <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters, about which <b>the</b> flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant <b>but</b> deep there came up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wind a roaring sound like <b>the</b> roll <b>of</b> thunder heard far away.
<br>   “Behold Tol Brandir! “said Aragorn, pointing south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tall peak. “Upon <b>the</b> left stands Amon Lhaw, <b>and</b> upon <b>the</b> right <b>is</b> Amon Hen <b>the</b> Hills <b>of</b> Hearing <b>and</b> <b>of</b> Sight. In <b>the</b> days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great kings there were high seats upon them, <b>and</b> watch <b>was</b> kept there. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> said that <b>no</b> foot <b>of</b> man <b>or</b> beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere <b>the</b> shade <b>of</b> night falls we shall come <b>to</b> them. <b>I</b> hear <b>the</b> endless voice <b>of</b> Rauros calling.”
<br>   The Company rested now for a while, drifting south <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current that flowed through <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. They ate some food, <b>and</b> then they took <b>to</b> their paddles <b>and</b> hastened <b>on</b> their way. The sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> westward hills fell <b>into</b> shadow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sun grew round <b>and</b> red. Here <b>and</b> there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twilight. Rauros <b>was</b> roaring with a great voice. Already night <b>was</b> laid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flowing waters when <b>the</b> travellers came at last under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills.
<br>   The tenth day <b>of</b> their journey <b>was</b> over. Wilderland <b>was</b> behind them. They could go <b>no</b> further <b>without</b> choice between <b>the</b> east-way <b>and</b> <b>the</b> west. The last stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest <b>was</b> before them.
<br>   
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> 10
<br><b>THE</b> BREAKING OF <b>THE</b> FELLOWSHIP
<br>   
<br>   Aragorn led them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. Here upon its western side under <b>the</b> shadow <b>of</b> Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water from <b>the</b> feet <b>of</b> Amon Hen. Behind <b>it</b> rose <b>the</b> first gentle slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill clad with trees, <b>and</b> trees marched away westward along <b>the</b> curving shores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. A little spring fell tumbling down <b>and</b> fed <b>the</b> grass.
<br>   “Here we will rest tonight,” said Aragorn. “This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lawn <b>of</b> Parth Galen: a fair place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer days <b>of</b> old. Let us hope that <b>no</b> evil has yet come here.”
<br>   They drew up their boats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green banks, <b>and</b> beside them they made their camp. They set a watch, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> sight nor sound <b>of</b> their enemies. If Gollum <b>had</b> contrived <b>to</b> follow them, he remained unseen <b>and</b> unheard. Nonetheless as <b>the</b> night wore <b>on</b> Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often <b>in</b> his sleep <b>and</b> waking. In <b>the</b> small hours he got up <b>and</b> came <b>to</b> Frodo, whose turn <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> watch.
<br>   “Why are you waking? “asked Frodo. “It <b>is</b> not your watch.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know,” answered Aragorn; “<b>but</b> a shadow <b>and</b> a threat has been growing <b>in</b> my sleep. It would be well <b>to</b> draw your sword.”
<br>   “Why? “said Frodo. “Are enemies at hand?”
<br>   “Let us see <b>what</b> Sting may show,” answered Aragorn.
<br>   Frodo then drew <b>the</b> elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay <b>the</b> edges gleamed dimly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night. “Orcs! “he said. “Not <b>very</b> near, <b>and</b> yet too near, <b>it</b> seems.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> feared as much,” said Aragorn. “But maybe they are not <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River. The light <b>of</b> Sting <b>is</b> faint, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> may point <b>to</b> <b>no</b> more than spies <b>of</b> Mordor roaming <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> Amon Lhaw. <b>I</b> have never heard before <b>of</b> Orcs upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows <b>what</b> may happen <b>in</b> these evil days, now that Minas Tirith <b>no</b> longer holds secure <b>the</b> passages <b>of</b> Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.”
<br>   The day came like fire <b>and</b> smoke. Low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East there were black bars <b>of</b> cloud like <b>the</b> fumes <b>of</b> a great burning. The rising sun lit them from beneath with flames <b>of</b> murky red; <b>but</b> soon <b>it</b> climbed above them <b>into</b> a clear sky. The summit <b>of</b> Tol Brandir <b>was</b> tipped with gold. Frodo looked out eastward <b>and</b> gazed at <b>the</b> tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> running water. High up above <b>the</b> tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above another; <b>and</b> above them again were grey faces <b>of</b> inaccessible rock, crowned <b>by</b> a great spire <b>of</b> stone. Many birds were circling about <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> sign <b>of</b> other living things could be seen.
<br>   When they <b>had</b> eaten, Aragorn called <b>the</b> Company together. “The day has come at last,” he said: “<b>the</b> day <b>of</b> choice which we have long delayed. What shall now become <b>of</b> our Company that has travelled so far <b>in</b> fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir <b>and</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wars <b>of</b> Gondor; <b>or</b> turn east <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fear <b>and</b> Shadow; <b>or</b> shall we break our fellowship <b>and</b> go this way <b>and</b> that as each may choose? Whatever we <b>do</b> must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern shore, we know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> fear that <b>the</b> Orcs may already be <b>on</b> this side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water.”
<br>   There <b>was</b> a long silence <b>in</b> which <b>no</b> one spoke <b>or</b> moved.
<br>   “Well, Frodo,” said Aragorn at last. “<b>I</b> fear that <b>the</b> burden <b>is</b> laid upon you. You are <b>the</b> Bearer appointed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Council. Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter <b>I</b> cannot advise you. <b>I</b> am not Gandalf, <b>and</b> though <b>I</b> have tried <b>to</b> bear his part, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> design <b>or</b> hope he <b>had</b> for this hour, if indeed he <b>had</b> any. Most likely <b>it</b> seems that if he were here now <b>the</b> choice would still wait <b>on</b> you. Such <b>is</b> your fate.”
<br>   Frodo did not answer at <b>once</b>. Then he spoke slowly. “<b>I</b> know that haste <b>is</b> needed, yet <b>I</b> cannot choose. The burden <b>is</b> heavy. Give me an hour longer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will speak. Let me be alone!”
<br>   Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. “Very well, Frodo son <b>of</b> Drogo,” he said. “You shall have an hour, <b>and</b> you shall be alone. We will stay here for a while. But <b>do</b> not stray far <b>or</b> out <b>of</b> call.”
<br>   Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who <b>had</b> been watching his master with great concern, shook his head <b>and</b> muttered: “Plain as a pikestaff <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> good Sam Gamgee putting <b>in</b> his spoke just now.” ,
<br>   Presently Frodo got up <b>and</b> walked away; <b>and</b> Sam saw that while <b>the</b> others restrained themselves <b>and</b> did not stare at him, <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out <b>of</b> sight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trees at <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> Amon Hen.
<br>   Wandering aimlessly at first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards <b>the</b> slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. He came <b>to</b> a path, <b>the</b> dwindling ruins <b>of</b> a road <b>of</b> long ago. In steep places stairs <b>of</b> stone <b>had</b> been hewn, <b>but</b> now they were cracked <b>and</b> worn, <b>and</b> split <b>by</b> <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came <b>to</b> a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst <b>was</b> a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn <b>was</b> open upon <b>the</b> East <b>and</b> <b>was</b> filled now with <b>the</b> early sunlight. Frodo halted <b>and</b> looked out over <b>the</b> River, far below him, <b>to</b> Tol Brandir <b>and</b> <b>the</b> birds wheeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great gulf <b>of</b> air between him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> untrodden isle. The voice <b>of</b> Rauros <b>was</b> a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.
<br>   He sat down upon <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> cupped his chin <b>in</b> his hands, staring eastwards <b>but</b> seeing little with his eyes. All that <b>had</b> happened since Bilbo left <b>the</b> Shire <b>was</b> passing through his mind, <b>and</b> he recalled <b>and</b> pondered everything that he could remember <b>of</b> Gandalf's words. Time went <b>on</b>, <b>and</b> still he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> nearer <b>to</b> a choice.
<br>   Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came <b>to</b> him that something <b>was</b> behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up <b>and</b> turned; <b>but</b> all that he saw <b>to</b> his surprise <b>was</b> Boromir, <b>and</b> his face <b>was</b> smiling <b>and</b> kind.
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid for you, Frodo,” he said, coming forward. “If Aragorn <b>is</b> right <b>and</b> Orcs are near, then none <b>of</b> us should wander alone, <b>and</b> you least <b>of</b> all: so much depends <b>on</b> you. And my heart too <b>is</b> heavy. May <b>I</b> stay now <b>and</b> talk for a while, since <b>I</b> have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate <b>without</b> end. But two together may perhaps find wisdom.”
<br>   “You are kind,” answered Frodo. “But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that any speech will help me. For <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should <b>do</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am afraid <b>of</b> doing <b>it</b>, Boromir: afraid.”
<br>   Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly <b>on</b>. The wind murmured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees. Frodo shivered.
<br>   Suddenly Boromir came <b>and</b> sat beside him. “Are you sure that you <b>do</b> not suffer needlessly? “he said. “<b>I</b> wish <b>to</b> help you. You need counsel <b>in</b> your hard choice. Will you not take mine?”
<br>   “<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> know already <b>what</b> counsel you would give, Boromir,” said Frodo. “And <b>it</b> would seem like wisdom <b>but</b> for <b>the</b> warning <b>of</b> my heart.”
<br>   “Warning? Warning against <b>what</b>? “said Boromir sharply.
<br>   “Against delay. Against <b>the</b> way that seems easier. Against refusal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burden that <b>is</b> laid <b>on</b> me. Against-well, if <b>it</b> must be said, against trust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength <b>and</b> truth <b>of</b> Men.”
<br>   “Yet that strength has long protected you far away <b>in</b> your little country, though you knew <b>it</b> not.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt <b>the</b> valour <b>of</b> your people. But <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> changing. The walls <b>of</b> Minas Tirith may be strong, <b>but</b> they are not strong enough. If they fail, <b>what</b> then?”
<br>   “We shall fall <b>in</b> battle valiantly. Yet there <b>is</b> still hope that they will not fail.”
<br>   “No hope while <b>the</b> Ring lasts,” said Frodo.
<br>   “Ah! The Ring! “said Boromir, his eyes lighting. “The Ring! Is <b>it</b> not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear <b>and</b> doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing! And <b>I</b> have seen <b>it</b> only for an instant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Elrond. Could <b>I</b> not have a sight <b>of</b> <b>it</b> again?”
<br>   Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught <b>the</b> strange gleam <b>in</b> Boromir's eyes, yet his face <b>was</b> still kind <b>and</b> friendly. “It <b>is</b> best that <b>it</b> should lie hidden,” he answered.
<br>   “As you wish. <b>I</b> care not,” said Boromir. “Yet may <b>I</b> not even speak <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? For you seem ever <b>to</b> think only <b>of</b> its power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy: <b>of</b> its evil uses not <b>of</b> its good. The world <b>is</b> changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if <b>the</b> Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if <b>the</b> Ring were with <b>the</b> Enemy. But why, if <b>it</b> were with us?”
<br>   “Were you not at <b>the</b> Council? “answered Frodo. “Because we cannot <b>use</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> done with <b>it</b> turns <b>to</b> evil.”
<br>   Boromir got up <b>and</b> walked about impatiently. “So you go <b>on</b>,” he cried. “Gandalf, Elrond—all these folk have taught you <b>to</b> say so. For themselves they may be right. These elves <b>and</b> half-elves <b>and</b> wizards, they would come <b>to</b> grief perhaps. Yet often <b>I</b> doubt if they are wise <b>and</b> not merely timid. But each <b>to</b> his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We <b>of</b> Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years <b>of</b> trial. We <b>do</b> not desire <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> wizard-lords, only strength <b>to</b> defend ourselves, strength <b>in</b> a just cause. And behold! <b>in</b> our need chance brings <b>to</b> light <b>the</b> -Ring <b>of</b> Power. It <b>is</b> a gift, <b>I</b> say; a gift <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foes <b>of</b> Mordor. It <b>is</b> mad not <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it</b>, <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy against him. The fearless, <b>the</b> ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn <b>do</b>? Or if he refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power <b>of</b> Command. How <b>I</b> would drive <b>the</b> hosts <b>of</b> Mordor, <b>and</b> all men would flock <b>to</b> my banner!”
<br>   Boromir strode up <b>and</b> down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed <b>to</b> have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt <b>on</b> walls <b>and</b> weapons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mustering <b>of</b> men; <b>and</b> he drew plans for great alliances <b>and</b> glorious victories <b>to</b> be; <b>and</b> he cast down Mordor, <b>and</b> became himself a mighty king, benevolent <b>and</b> wise. Suddenly he stopped <b>and</b> waved his arms.
<br>   “And they tell us <b>to</b> throw <b>it</b> away!” he cried. “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not say destroy <b>it</b>. That might be well, if reason could show any hope <b>of</b> doing so. It does not. The only plan that <b>is</b> proposed <b>to</b> us <b>is</b> that a halfling should walk blindly <b>into</b> Mordor <b>and</b> offer <b>the</b> Enemy every chance <b>of</b> recapturing <b>it</b> for himself. Folly!
<br>   “Surely you see <b>it</b>, my friend?” he said, turning now suddenly <b>to</b> Frodo again. “You say that you are afraid. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so, <b>the</b> boldest should pardon you. But <b>is</b> <b>it</b> not really your good sense that revolts?”
<br>   “No, <b>I</b> am afraid,” said Frodo. “Simply afraid. But <b>I</b> am glad <b>to</b> have heard you speak so fully. My mind <b>is</b> clearer now.”
<br>   “Then you will come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith? “cried Boromir. His eyes were shining <b>and</b> his face eager.
<br>   “You misunderstand me,” said Frodo.
<br>   “But you will come, at least for a while? “Boromir persisted. “My city <b>is</b> not far now; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> little further from there <b>to</b> Mordor than from here. We have been long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness, <b>and</b> you need news <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Enemy <b>is</b> doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,” he said. “You need rest before your venture. if go you must.” He laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hobbit's shoulder <b>in</b> friendly fashion; <b>but</b> Frodo felt <b>the</b> hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, <b>and</b> eyed with alarm <b>the</b> tall Man, nearly <b>twice</b> his height <b>and</b> many times his match <b>in</b> strength.
<br>   “Why are you so unfriendly? “said Boromir. “<b>I</b> am a true man, neither thief nor tracker. <b>I</b> need your Ring: that you know now; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> give you my word that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not desire <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b>. Will you not at least let me make trial <b>of</b> my plan? Lend me <b>the</b> Ring!”
<br>   “No! <b>no</b>! “cried Frodo. “The Council laid <b>it</b> upon me <b>to</b> bear <b>it</b>.”
<br>   “It <b>is</b> <b>by</b> our own folly that <b>the</b> Enemy will defeat us,” cried Boromir. “How <b>it</b> angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully <b>to</b> death <b>and</b> ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ring, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> men <b>of</b> N?menor, <b>and</b> not Halflings. It <b>is</b> not yours save <b>by</b> unhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me!”
<br>   Frodo did not answer, <b>but</b> moved away till <b>the</b> great flat stone stood between them. “Come, come, my friend! “said Boromir <b>in</b> a softer voice. “Why not <b>get</b> rid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>? Why not be free <b>of</b> your doubt <b>and</b> fear? You can lay <b>the</b> blame <b>on</b> me, if you will. You can say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too strong <b>and</b> took <b>it</b> <b>by</b> force. For <b>I</b> am too strong for you, halfling,” he cried; <b>and</b> suddenly he sprang over <b>the</b> stone <b>and</b> leaped at Frodo. His fair <b>and</b> pleasant face <b>was</b> hideously changed; a raging fire <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his eyes.
<br>   Frodo dodged aside <b>and</b> again put <b>the</b> stone between them. There <b>was</b> only one thing he could <b>do</b>: trembling he pulled out <b>the</b> Ring upon its chain <b>and</b> quickly slipped <b>it</b> <b>on</b> his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, <b>and</b> then ran wildly about, seeking here <b>and</b> there among <b>the</b> rocks <b>and</b> trees.
<br>   “Miserable trickster!” he shouted. “Let me <b>get</b> my hands <b>on</b> you! Now <b>I</b> see your mind. You will take <b>the</b> Ring <b>to</b> Sauron <b>and</b> sell us all. You have only waited your chance <b>to</b> leave us <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lurch. Curse you <b>and</b> all halflings <b>to</b> death <b>and</b> darkness! “Then, catching his foot <b>on</b> a stone, he fell sprawling <b>and</b> lay upon his face. For a while he <b>was</b> as still as if his own curse <b>had</b> struck him down; then suddenly he wept.
<br>   He rose <b>and</b> passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away <b>the</b> tears. “What have <b>I</b> said? “he cried. “What have <b>I</b> done? Frodo, Frodo! “he called. “Come back! A madness took me, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> has passed. Come back!”
<br>   There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He <b>was</b> already far away, leaping blindly up <b>the</b> path <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill-top. Terror <b>and</b> grief shook him, seeing <b>in</b> his <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> mad fierce face <b>of</b> Boromir, <b>and</b> his burning eyes.
<br>   Soon he came out alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit <b>of</b> Amon Hen, <b>and</b> halted, gasping for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, <b>and</b> surrounded with a crumbling battlement; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, set upon four carven pillars, <b>was</b> a high seat, reached <b>by</b> a stair <b>of</b> many steps. Up he went <b>and</b> sat upon <b>the</b> ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that <b>had</b> clambered upon <b>the</b> throne <b>of</b> mountain-kings.
<br>   At first he could see little. He seemed <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> a world <b>of</b> mist <b>in</b> which there were only shadows: <b>the</b> Ring <b>was</b> upon him. Then here <b>and</b> there <b>the</b> mist gave way <b>and</b> he saw many visions: small <b>and</b> clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, <b>and</b> yet remote. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> sound, only bright living images. The world seemed <b>to</b> have shrunk <b>and</b> fallen silent. He <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> upon <b>the</b> Seat <b>of</b> Seeing, <b>on</b> Amon Hen, <b>the</b> Hill <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Men <b>of</b> N?menor. Eastward he looked <b>into</b> wide uncharted lands, nameless plains, <b>and</b> forests unexplored. Northward he looked, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Misty Mountains stood small <b>and</b> hard as broken teeth. Westward he looked <b>and</b> saw <b>the</b> broad pastures <b>of</b> Rohan; <b>and</b> Orthanc, <b>the</b> pinnacle <b>of</b> Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, <b>and</b> below his <b>very</b> feet <b>the</b> Great River curled like a toppling wave <b>and</b> plunged over <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Rauros <b>into</b> a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon <b>the</b> fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, <b>the</b> mighty delta <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River, <b>and</b> myriads <b>of</b> sea-birds whirling like a white dust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun, <b>and</b> beneath them a green <b>and</b> silver sea, rippling <b>in</b> endless lines.
<br>   But everywhere he looked he saw <b>the</b> signs <b>of</b> war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were issuing out <b>of</b> a thousand holes. Under <b>the</b> boughs <b>of</b> Mirkwood there <b>was</b> deadly strife <b>of</b> Elves <b>and</b> Men <b>and</b> fell beasts. The land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beornings <b>was</b> aflame; a cloud <b>was</b> over Moria; smoke rose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> borders <b>of</b> L?rien.
<br>   Horsemen were galloping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass <b>of</b> Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From <b>the</b> havens <b>of</b> Harad ships <b>of</b> war put out <b>to</b> sea; <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots <b>of</b> chieftains <b>and</b> laden wains. All <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dark Lord <b>was</b> <b>in</b> motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away <b>it</b> seemed. <b>and</b> beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud <b>and</b> fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements glittered with steel, <b>and</b> its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped <b>in</b> his heart. But against Minas Tirith <b>was</b> set another fortress, greater <b>and</b> more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye <b>was</b> drawn. It passed <b>the</b> ruined bridges <b>of</b> Osgiliath, <b>the</b> grinning gates <b>of</b> Minas Morgul. <b>and</b> <b>the</b> haunted Mountains, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> looked upon Gorgoroth, <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> terror <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Mordor. Darkness lay there under <b>the</b> Sun. Fire glowed amid <b>the</b> smoke. Mount Doom <b>was</b> burning, <b>and</b> a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze <b>was</b> held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain <b>of</b> iron, gate <b>of</b> steel, tower <b>of</b> adamant, he saw <b>it</b>: Barad-d?r, Fortress <b>of</b> Sauron. All hope left him.
<br>   And suddenly he felt <b>the</b> Eye. There <b>was</b> an eye <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> become aware <b>of</b> his gaze. A fierce eager will <b>was</b> there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt <b>it</b>, searching for him. Very soon <b>it</b> would nail him down, know just exactly where he <b>was</b>. Amon Lhaw <b>it</b> touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself from <b>the</b> seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.
<br>   He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or <b>was</b> <b>it</b>: Verily <b>I</b> come, <b>I</b> come <b>to</b> you? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point <b>of</b> power there came <b>to</b> his mind another <b>thought</b>: Take <b>it</b> off! Take <b>it</b> off! Fool, take <b>it</b> off! Take off <b>the</b> Ring!
<br>   The two powers strove <b>in</b> him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he <b>was</b> aware <b>of</b> himself again. Frodo, neither <b>the</b> Voice nor <b>the</b> Eye: free <b>to</b> choose, <b>and</b> with one remaining instant <b>in</b> which <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He took <b>the</b> Ring off his finger. He <b>was</b> kneeling <b>in</b> clear sunlight before <b>the</b> high seat. A black shadow seemed <b>to</b> pass like an arm above him; <b>it</b> missed Amon Hen <b>and</b> groped out west, <b>and</b> faded. Then all <b>the</b> sky <b>was</b> clean <b>and</b> blue <b>and</b> birds sang <b>in</b> every tree.
<br>   Frodo rose <b>to</b> his feet. A great weariness <b>was</b> <b>on</b> him, <b>but</b> his will <b>was</b> firm <b>and</b> his heart lighter. He spoke aloud <b>to</b> himself. “<b>I</b> will <b>do</b> now <b>what</b> <b>I</b> must,” he said. “This at least <b>is</b> plain: <b>the</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring <b>is</b> already at work even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Company, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring must leave them before <b>it</b> does more harm. <b>I</b> will go alone. Some <b>I</b> cannot trust, <b>and</b> those <b>I</b> can trust are too dear <b>to</b> me: poor old Sam, <b>and</b> Merry <b>and</b> Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, <b>and</b> he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen <b>into</b> evil. <b>I</b> will go alone. At <b>once</b>.”
<br>   He went quickly down <b>the</b> path <b>and</b> came back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lawn where Boromir <b>had</b> found him. Then he halted, listening. He <b>thought</b> he could hear cries <b>and</b> calls from <b>the</b> woods near <b>the</b> shore below.
<br>   “They'll be hunting for me,” he said. “<b>I</b> wonder how long <b>I</b> have been away. Hours, <b>I</b> should think.” He hesitated. “What can <b>I</b> <b>do</b>? “he muttered. “<b>I</b> must go now <b>or</b> <b>I</b> shall never go. <b>I</b> shan't <b>get</b> a chance again. <b>I</b> hate leaving them, <b>and</b> like this <b>without</b> any explanation. But surely they will understand. Sam will. And <b>what</b> else can <b>I</b> <b>do</b>?”
<br>   Slowly he drew out <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>once</b> more. He vanished <b>and</b> passed down <b>the</b> hill, less than a rustle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind.
<br>   The others remained long <b>by</b> <b>the</b> river-side. For some time they <b>had</b> been silent, moving restlessly about; <b>but</b> now they were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a circle, <b>and</b> they were talking. Every now <b>and</b> again they made efforts <b>to</b> speak <b>of</b> other things, <b>of</b> their long road <b>and</b> many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning <b>the</b> realm <b>of</b> Gondor <b>and</b> its ancient history, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> remnants <b>of</b> its great works that could still be seen <b>in</b> this strange border-land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil: <b>the</b> stone kings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seats <b>of</b> Lhaw <b>and</b> Hen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> great Stair beside <b>the</b> falls <b>of</b> Rauros. But always their thoughts <b>and</b> words strayed back <b>to</b> Frodo <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Ring. What would Frodo choose <b>to</b> <b>do</b>? Why <b>was</b> he hesitating?
<br>   “He <b>is</b> debating which course <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most desperate, <b>I</b> think,” said Aragorn. “And well he may. It <b>is</b> now more hopeless than ever for <b>the</b> Company <b>to</b> go east, since we have been tracked <b>by</b> Gollum, <b>and</b> must fear that <b>the</b> secret <b>of</b> our journey <b>is</b> already betrayed. But Minas Tirith <b>is</b> <b>no</b> nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burden.
<br>   “We may remain there for a while <b>and</b> make a brave stand; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Lord Denethor <b>and</b> all his men cannot hope <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> even Elrond said <b>was</b> beyond his power: either <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> Burden secret. <b>or</b> <b>to</b> hold off <b>the</b> full might <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enemy when he comes <b>to</b> take <b>it</b>. Which way would any <b>of</b> us choose <b>in</b> Frodo's place? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.”
<br>   “Grievous <b>is</b> our loss,” said Legolas. “Yet we must needs make up our minds <b>without</b> his aid. Why cannot we decide, <b>and</b> so help Frodo? Let us call him back <b>and</b> then vote! <b>I</b> should vote for Minas Tirith.”
<br>   “And so should <b>I</b>,” said Gimli. “We, <b>of</b> course, were only sent <b>to</b> help <b>the</b> Bearer along <b>the</b> road, <b>to</b> go <b>no</b> further than we wished; <b>and</b> none <b>of</b> us <b>is</b> under any oath <b>or</b> command <b>to</b> seek Mount Doom. Hard <b>was</b> my parting from Lothl?rien. Yet <b>I</b> have come so far, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say this: now we have reached <b>the</b> last choice, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> clear <b>to</b> me that <b>I</b> cannot leave Frodo. <b>I</b> would choose Minas Tirith, <b>but</b> if he does not, then <b>I</b> follow him.”
<br>   “And <b>I</b> too will go with him,” said Legolas. “It would be faithless now <b>to</b> say farewell.”
<br>   “It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,” said Aragorn. “But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think that all should. That venture <b>is</b> desperate: as much so for eight as for three <b>or</b> two, <b>or</b> one alone. If you would let me choose, then <b>I</b> should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear <b>it</b> otherwise; <b>and</b> Gimli; <b>and</b> myself. Boromir will return <b>to</b> his own city, where his father <b>and</b> his people need him; <b>and</b> with him <b>the</b> others should go, <b>or</b> at least Meriadoc <b>and</b> Peregrin, if Legolas <b>is</b> not willing <b>to</b> leave us.”
<br>   “That won't <b>do</b> at all! “cried Merry. “We can't leave Frodo! Pippin <b>and</b> <b>I</b> always intended <b>to</b> go wherever he went, <b>and</b> we still <b>do</b>. But we did not realize <b>what</b> that would mean. It seemed different so far away, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shire <b>or</b> <b>in</b> Rivendell. It would be mad <b>and</b> cruel <b>to</b> let Frodo go <b>to</b> Mordor. Why can't we stop him?”
<br>   “We must stop him,” said Pippin. “And that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he <b>is</b> worrying about, <b>I</b> am sure. He knows we shan't agree <b>to</b> his going east. And he doesn't like <b>to</b> ask anyone <b>to</b> go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine <b>it</b>: going off <b>to</b> Mordor alone! “Pippin shuddered. “But <b>the</b> dear silly old hobbit, he ought <b>to</b> know that he hasn't got <b>to</b> ask. He ought <b>to</b> know that if we can't stop him, we shan't leave him.”
<br>   “Begging your pardon,” said Sam. “<b>I</b> don't think you understand my master at all. He isn't hesitating about which way <b>to</b> go. Of course not! What's <b>the</b> good <b>of</b> Minas Tirith anyway? To him, <b>I</b> mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,” he added, <b>and</b> turned. It <b>was</b> then that they discovered that Boromir, who at first <b>had</b> been <b>sitting</b> silent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle, <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer there.
<br>   “Now where's he got <b>to</b>? “cried Sam, looking worried. “He's been a bit queer lately, <b>to</b> my mind. But anyway he's not <b>in</b> this business. He's off <b>to</b> his home, as he always said; <b>and</b> <b>no</b> blame <b>to</b> him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows he's got <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> Cracks <b>of</b> Doom, if he can. But he's afraid. Now <b>it</b>'s come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point, he's just plain terrified. That's <b>what</b> his trouble <b>is</b>. Of course he's <b>had</b> a bit <b>of</b> schooling, so <b>to</b> speak-we all have-since we left home, <b>or</b> he'd be so terrified he'd just fling <b>the</b> Ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> River <b>and</b> bolt. But he's still too frightened <b>to</b> start. And he isn't worrying about us either: whether we'll go along with him <b>or</b> <b>no</b>. He knows we mean <b>to</b>. That's another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up <b>to</b> go, he'll want <b>to</b> go alone. Mark my words! We're going <b>to</b> have trouble when he comes back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> believe you speak more wisely than any <b>of</b> us, Sam,” said Aragorn. “And <b>what</b> shall we <b>do</b>, if you prove right?”
<br>   “Stop him! Don't let him go! “cried Pippin.
<br>   “<b>I</b> wonder? “said Aragorn. “He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Bearer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Burden <b>is</b> <b>on</b> him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> our part <b>to</b> drive him one way <b>or</b> <b>the</b> other. Nor <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are other powers at work far stronger.”
<br>   “Well, <b>I</b> wish Frodo would “screw himself up” <b>and</b> come back. <b>and</b> let us <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over,” said Pippin. “This waiting <b>is</b> horrible! Surely <b>the</b> time <b>is</b> up?”
<br>   “Yes,” said Aragorn. “The hour <b>is</b> long passed. The morning <b>is</b> wearing away. We must call for him.”
<br>   At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from <b>the</b> trees <b>and</b> walked towards them <b>without</b> speaking. His face looked grim <b>and</b> sad. He paused as if counting those that were present, <b>and</b> then sat down aloof, with his eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground.
<br>   “Where have you been, Boromir? “asked Aragorn. “Have you seen Frodo?”
<br>   Boromir hesitated for a second. “Yes, <b>and</b> <b>no</b>,” he answered slowly. “Yes: <b>I</b> found him some way up <b>the</b> hill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>to</b> him. <b>I</b> urged him <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> Minas Tirith <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> go east. <b>I</b> grew angry <b>and</b> he left me. He vanished. <b>I</b> have never seen such a thing happen before. though <b>I</b> have heard <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> tales. He must have put <b>the</b> Ring <b>on</b>. <b>I</b> could not find him again. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> he would return <b>to</b> you.”
<br>   “Is that all that you have <b>to</b> say? “said Aragorn, looking hard <b>and</b> not too kindly at Boromir.
<br>   “Yes,” he answered. “<b>I</b> will say <b>no</b> more yet.”
<br>   “This <b>is</b> bad!” cried Sam, jumping up. “<b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> this Man has been up <b>to</b>. Why should Mr. Frodo put <b>the</b> thing <b>on</b>? He didn't ought <b>to</b> have; <b>and</b> if he has, goodness knows <b>what</b> may have happened!”
<br>   “But he wouldn't keep <b>it</b> <b>on</b>`” said Merry. “Not when he <b>had</b> escaped <b>the</b> unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used <b>to</b>.”
<br>   “But where did he go? Where <b>is</b> he? “cried Pippin. “He's been away ages now.”
<br>   “How long <b>is</b> <b>it</b> since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? “asked Aragorn.
<br>   “Half an hour, maybe,” he answered. “Or <b>it</b> might be an hour. <b>I</b> have wandered for some time since. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know! “He put his head <b>in</b> his hands, <b>and</b> sat as if bowed with grief.
<br>   “An hour since he vanished! “shouted Sam. “We must try <b>and</b> find him at <b>once</b>. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>   “Wait a moment! “cried Aragorn. “We must divide up <b>into</b> pairs, <b>and</b> arrange-here, hold <b>on</b>! Wait!”
<br>   It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> good. They took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> him. Sam <b>had</b> dashed off first. Merry <b>and</b> Pippin <b>had</b> followed, <b>and</b> were already disappearing westward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo! <b>in</b> their clear, high hobbit-voices. Legolas <b>and</b> Gimli were running. A sudden panic <b>or</b> madness seemed <b>to</b> have fallen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Company.
<br>   “We shall all be scattered <b>and</b> lost,” groaned Aragorn. “Boromir! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know <b>what</b> part you have played <b>in</b> this mischief, <b>but</b> help now! Go after those two young hobbits, <b>and</b> guard them at <b>the</b> least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back <b>to</b> this spot, if you find him, <b>or</b> any traces <b>of</b> him. <b>I</b> shall return soon.”
<br>   Aragorn sprang swiftly away <b>and</b> went <b>in</b> pursuit <b>of</b> Sam. Just as he reached <b>the</b> little lawn among <b>the</b> rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill, panting <b>and</b> calling, Frodo!
<br>   “Come with me, Sam! “he said. “None <b>of</b> us should be alone. There <b>is</b> mischief about. <b>I</b> feel <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Seat <b>of</b> Amon Hen, <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> may be seen. And look! It <b>is</b> as my heart guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow me, <b>and</b> keep your eyes open! “He sped up <b>the</b> path.
<br>   Sam did his best, <b>but</b> he could not keep up with Strider <b>the</b> Ranger, <b>and</b> soon fell behind. He <b>had</b> not gone far before Aragorn <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> sight ahead. Sam stopped <b>and</b> puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand <b>to</b> his head.
<br>   “Whoa, Sam Gamgee! “he said aloud. “Your legs are too short, so <b>use</b> your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; <b>but</b> he hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed himself up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point, sudden. He made up his mind at last <b>to</b> go. Where <b>to</b>? Off East. Not <b>without</b> Sam? Yes, <b>without</b> even his Sam. That's hard, cruel hard.”
<br>   Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away <b>the</b> tears. “Steady, Gamgee! “he said. “Think, if you can! He can't fly across rivers, <b>and</b> he can't jump waterfalls. He's got <b>no</b> gear. So he's got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats. Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats! Back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> boats, Sam, like lightning!”
<br>   Sam turned <b>and</b> bolted back down <b>the</b> path. He fell <b>and</b> cut his knees. Up he got <b>and</b> ran <b>on</b>. He came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lawn <b>of</b> Parth Galen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> shore, where <b>the</b> boats were drawn up out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. No one <b>was</b> there. There seemed <b>to</b> be cries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods behind, <b>but</b> he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment. stock-still, gaping. A boat <b>was</b> sliding down <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> all <b>by</b> itself. With a shout Sam raced across <b>the</b> grass. The boat slipped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water.
<br>   “Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! “called Sam, <b>and</b> flung himself from <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, clutching at <b>the</b> departing boat. He missed <b>it</b> <b>by</b> a yard. With a cry <b>and</b> a splash he fell face downward <b>into</b> deep swift water. Gurgling he went under, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River closed over his curly head.
<br>   An exclamation <b>of</b> dismay came from <b>the</b> empty boat. A paddle swirled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> boat put about. Frodo <b>was</b> just <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> grasp Sam <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hair as he came up, bubbling <b>and</b> struggling. Fear <b>was</b> staring <b>in</b> his round brown eyes.
<br>   “Up you come, Sam my lad! “said Frodo. “Now take my hand!”
<br>   “Save me, Mr. Frodo! “gasped Sam. “<b>I</b>'m drownded. <b>I</b> can't see your hand.”
<br>   “Here <b>it</b> <b>is</b>. Don't pinch, lad! <b>I</b> won't let you go. Tread water <b>and</b> don't flounder, <b>or</b> you'll upset <b>the</b> boat. There now, <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side, <b>and</b> let me <b>use</b> <b>the</b> paddle!”
<br>   With a few strokes Frodo brought <b>the</b> boat back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>. <b>and</b> Sam <b>was</b> able <b>to</b> scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off <b>the</b> Ring <b>and</b> stepped ashore again.
<br>   “Of all <b>the</b> confounded nuisances you are <b>the</b> worst, Sam! “he said.
<br>   “Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard! “said Sam shivering. “That's hard, trying <b>to</b> go <b>without</b> me <b>and</b> all. If <b>I</b> hadn't a guessed right, where would you be now?”
<br>   “Safely <b>on</b> my way.”
<br>   “Safely! “said Sam. “All alone <b>and</b> <b>without</b> me <b>to</b> help you? <b>I</b> couldn't have a borne <b>it</b>, <b>it</b>'d have been <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> me.”
<br>   “It would be <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> come with me, Sam,” said Frodo <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could not have borne that.”
<br>   “Not as certain as being left behind,” said Sam.
<br>   “But <b>I</b> am going <b>to</b> Mordor.”
<br>   “<b>I</b> know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And <b>I</b>'m coming with you.”
<br>   “Now, Sam,” said Frodo, “don't hinder me! The others will be coming back at any minute. If they catch me here. <b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> argue <b>and</b> explain, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall never have <b>the</b> heart <b>or</b> <b>the</b> chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off. But <b>I</b> must go at <b>once</b>. It's <b>the</b> only way.”
<br>   “Of course <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” answered Sam. “But not alone. <b>I</b>'m coming too, <b>or</b> neither <b>of</b> us isn't going. <b>I</b>'ll knock holes <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> boats first.”
<br>   Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth <b>and</b> gladness touched his heart. “Leave one! “he said. “We'll need <b>it</b>. But you can't come like this <b>without</b> your gear <b>or</b> food <b>or</b> anything.”
<br>   “Just hold <b>on</b> a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ll <b>get</b> my stuff!” cried Sam eagerly. “It's all ready. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we should be off today.” He rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camping place, fished out his pack from <b>the</b> pile where Frodo <b>had</b> laid <b>it</b> when he emptied <b>the</b> boat <b>of</b> his companions” goods grabbed a spare blanket, <b>and</b> some extra packages <b>of</b> food, <b>and</b> ran back.
<br>   “So all my plan <b>is</b> spoilt! “said Frodo. “It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> good trying <b>to</b> escape you. But <b>I</b>'m glad, Sam. <b>I</b> cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It <b>is</b> plain that we were meant <b>to</b> go together. We will go, <b>and</b> may <b>the</b> others find a safe road! Strider will look after them. <b>I</b> don't suppose we shall see them again.”
<br>   “Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,” said Sam.
<br>   So Frodo <b>and</b> Sam set off <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quest together. Frodo paddled away from <b>the</b> shore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> River bore them swiftly away. down <b>the</b> western arm, <b>and</b> past <b>the</b> frowning cliffs <b>of</b> Tol Brandir. The roar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hard work <b>to</b> pass across <b>the</b> current at <b>the</b> southward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island <b>and</b> drive <b>the</b> boat eastward towards <b>the</b> far shore.
<br>   At length they came <b>to</b> land again upon <b>the</b> southern slopes <b>of</b> Amon Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, <b>and</b> they drew <b>the</b> boat out, high above <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> hid <b>it</b> as well as they could behind a great boulder. Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would bring them over <b>the</b> grey hills <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emyn Muil, <b>and</b> down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Land <b>of</b> Shadow.
<br>   
<br>   Here ends <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring.
<br>   
<br>   The second part <b>is</b> called The Two Towers, since <b>the</b> events recounted <b>in</b> <b>it</b> are dominated <b>by</b> Orthanc, <b>the</b> citadel <b>of</b> Saruman, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fortress <b>of</b> Minas Morgul that guards <b>the</b> secret entrance <b>to</b> Mordor; <b>it</b> tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deeds <b>and</b> perils <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> now sundered fellowship, until <b>the</b> coming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Darkness.
<br>   The third part tells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last defence against <b>the</b> Shadow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ring-bearer <b>in</b> The Return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King.
<br>1 As <b>the</b> records <b>of</b> Gondor relate this <b>was</b> Argeleb II, <b>the</b> twentieth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern line, which came <b>to</b> an end with Arvedui three hundred years later.
<br>2 Thus, <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Age <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reckoning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Elves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> D?nedain may be found <b>by</b> adding 1600 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dates <b>of</b> Shire-reckoning.
