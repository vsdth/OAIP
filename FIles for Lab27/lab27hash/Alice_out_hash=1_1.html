<br><b>Chapter</b> <b>I</b>
<br><b>DOWN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RABBIT</b>-<b>HOLE</b>
<br>
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>: <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>peeped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>was</b> <b>reading</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>or</b> <b>conversations</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, “<b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>book</b>,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b> “<b>without</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>or</b> <b>conversation</b>?”
<br>So <b>she</b> <b>was</b> considering <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own mind (as well as <b>she</b> could, for <b>the</b> hot day made <b>her</b> feel <b>very</b> sleepy <b>and</b> stupid), whether <b>the</b> pleasure <b>of</b> making a daisy-chain would be worth <b>the</b> trouble <b>of</b> getting up <b>and</b> picking <b>the</b> daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close <b>by</b> <b>her</b>.
<br>There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> so VERY remarkable <b>in</b> that; nor did <b>Alice</b> think <b>it</b> so VERY much out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way <b>to</b> hear <b>the</b> Rabbit say <b>to</b> itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! <b>I</b> shall be late!” (when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> over afterwards, <b>it</b> occurred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> ought <b>to</b> have wondered at this, <b>but</b> at <b>the</b> time <b>it</b> all seemed quite natural); <b>but</b> when <b>the</b> Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then hurried <b>on</b>, <b>Alice</b> started <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet, for <b>it</b> flashed across <b>her</b> mind that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never before see a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, <b>or</b> a watch <b>to</b> take out <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> burning with curiosity, <b>she</b> ran across <b>the</b> field after <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> fortunately <b>was</b> just <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> pop down a large rabbit-hole under <b>the</b> hedge.
<br>In another moment down went <b>Alice</b> after <b>it</b>, never <b>once</b> considering how <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out again.
<br>The rabbit-hole went straight <b>on</b> like a tunnel for some way, <b>and</b> then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> not a moment <b>to</b> think about stopping herself before <b>she</b> found herself falling down a <b>very</b> deep well.
<br>Either <b>the</b> well <b>was</b> <b>very</b> deep, <b>or</b> <b>she</b> fell <b>very</b> slowly, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> plenty <b>of</b> time as <b>she</b> went down <b>to</b> look about <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> wonder <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> happen next. First, <b>she</b> tried <b>to</b> look down <b>and</b> make out <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> coming <b>to</b>, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too dark <b>to</b> see anything; then <b>she</b> looked at <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well, <b>and</b> noticed that they were filled with cupboards <b>and</b> <b>book</b>-shelves; here <b>and</b> there <b>she</b> saw maps <b>and</b> <b>pictures</b> hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shelves as <b>she</b> passed; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE', <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> great disappointment <b>it</b> way empty: <b>she</b> did not like <b>to</b> drop <b>the</b> jar for fear <b>of</b> killing somebody, so managed <b>to</b> put <b>it</b> <b>into</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cupboards as <b>she</b> fell past <b>it</b>.
<br>“Well!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, “after such a fall as this, <b>I</b> shall think <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, <b>I</b> wouldn't say anything about <b>it</b>, even if <b>I</b> fell off <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house!” (Which <b>was</b> <b>very</b> likely true.)
<br>Down, down, down. Would <b>the</b> fall NEVER come <b>to</b> an end! “<b>I</b> wonder how many miles <b>I</b>'ve fallen <b>by</b> this time?” <b>she</b> said aloud. “<b>I</b> must be getting somewhere near <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, <b>I</b> think—” (for, you see, <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> learnt several things <b>of</b> this sort <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lessons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> schoolroom, <b>and</b> though this <b>was</b> not a VERY good opportunity for showing off <b>her</b> knowledge, as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> one <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, still <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good practice <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> over) “—yes, that's about <b>the</b> right distance—<b>but</b> then <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> Latitude <b>or</b> Longitude <b>I</b>'ve got <b>to</b>?” (<b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea <b>what</b> Latitude <b>was</b>, <b>or</b> Longitude either, <b>but</b> <b>thought</b> they were nice grand words <b>to</b> say.)
<br>Presently <b>she</b> began again. “<b>I</b> wonder if <b>I</b> shall fall right THROUGH <b>the</b> earth! How funny <b>it</b>'ll seem <b>to</b> come out among <b>the</b> people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, <b>I</b> think—” (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> rather glad there WAS <b>no</b> one listening, this time, as <b>it</b> didn't sound at all <b>the</b> right word) “—<b>but</b> <b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> ask them <b>what</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country <b>is</b>, you know. Please, Ma'am, <b>is</b> this New Zealand <b>or</b> Australia?” (<b>and</b> <b>she</b> tried <b>to</b> curtsey as <b>she</b> spoke—fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through <b>the</b> air! Do you think you could manage <b>it</b>?) “And <b>what</b> an ignorant little girl <b>she</b>'ll think me for asking! No, <b>it</b>'ll never <b>do</b> <b>to</b> ask: perhaps <b>I</b> shall see <b>it</b> written up somewhere.”
<br>Down, down, down. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, so <b>Alice</b> soon began talking again. Dinah'll miss me <b>very</b> much <b>to</b>-night, <b>I</b> should think!” (Dinah <b>was</b> <b>the</b> cat.) “<b>I</b> hope they'll remember <b>her</b> saucer <b>of</b> milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! <b>I</b> wish you were down here with me! There are <b>no</b> mice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>I</b>'m afraid, <b>but</b> you might catch a bat, <b>and</b> that's <b>very</b> like a mouse, you know. But <b>do</b> cats eat bats, <b>I</b> wonder?” And here <b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rather sleepy, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> saying <b>to</b> herself, <b>in</b> a dreamy sort <b>of</b> way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” <b>and</b> sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as <b>she</b> couldn't answer either question, <b>it</b> didn't much matter which way <b>she</b> put <b>it</b>. She felt that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dozing off, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> just begun <b>to</b> dream that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> walking hand <b>in</b> hand with Dinah, <b>and</b> saying <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>very</b> earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me <b>the</b> truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down <b>she</b> came upon a heap <b>of</b> stick <b>and</b> dry leaves, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fall <b>was</b> over.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> not a bit hurt, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> jumped up <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet <b>in</b> a moment: <b>she</b> looked up, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all dark overhead; before <b>her</b> <b>was</b> another long passage, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit <b>was</b> still <b>in</b> sight, hurrying down <b>it</b>. There <b>was</b> not a moment <b>to</b> be lost: away went <b>Alice</b> like <b>the</b> wind, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> just <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> hear <b>it</b> say, as <b>it</b> turned a corner, “Oh my ears <b>and</b> whiskers, how late <b>it</b>'s getting!” She <b>was</b> close behind <b>it</b> when <b>she</b> turned <b>to</b> corner, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit <b>was</b> <b>no</b> longer <b>to</b> be seen: <b>she</b> found herself <b>in</b> a long, low hall, which <b>was</b> lit up <b>by</b> a row <b>of</b> lamps hanging from <b>the</b> roof.
<br>There were doors all round <b>the</b> hall, <b>but</b> they were all locked; <b>and</b> when <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> been all <b>the</b> way down one side <b>and</b> up <b>the</b> other, trying every door, <b>she</b> walked sadly down <b>the</b> middle, wondering how <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ever <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out again.
<br>Suddenly <b>she</b> came upon a little three-legged table, all made <b>of</b> solid glass; there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> except a tiny golden key, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>'s first <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> that <b>it</b> might belong <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall; <b>but</b>, alas! either <b>the</b> locks were too large, <b>or</b> <b>the</b> key <b>was</b> too small, <b>but</b> at any rate <b>it</b> would not open any <b>of</b> them. However, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second time round, <b>she</b> came upon a low curtain <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not noticed before, <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a little door about fifteen inches high: <b>she</b> tried <b>the</b> little golden key <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lock, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> great delight <b>it</b> fitted!
<br><b>Alice</b> opened <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> found that <b>it</b> led <b>into</b> a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: <b>she</b> knelt down <b>and</b> looked along <b>the</b> passage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> loveliest garden you ever saw. How <b>she</b> longed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out <b>of</b> that dark hall, <b>and</b> wander about among those beds <b>of</b> bright flowers <b>and</b> those cool fountains, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> could <b>to</b> even <b>get</b> <b>her</b> head <b>thought</b> he doorway; “<b>and</b> even if my head would go through,” <b>thought</b> poor <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b> would be <b>of</b> <b>very</b> little <b>use</b> <b>without</b> my shoulders. Oh, how <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could shut up like a telescope! <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> could, if <b>I</b> only know how <b>to</b> begin.” For, you see, so many out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way things <b>had</b> happened lately, that <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> begun <b>to</b> think that <b>very</b> few things indeed were really impossible.
<br>There seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> waiting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> little door, so <b>she</b> went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table, half hoping <b>she</b> might find another key <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>or</b> at any rate a <b>book</b> <b>or</b> rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time <b>she</b> found a little bottle <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, (`which certainly <b>was</b> not here before,” said <b>Alice</b>,) <b>and</b> round <b>the</b> neck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bottle <b>was</b> a paper label, with <b>the</b> words “DRINK ME” beautifully printed <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> large letters.
<br>It <b>was</b> all <b>very</b> well <b>to</b> say “Drink me,” <b>but</b> <b>the</b> wise little <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> not going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> THAT <b>in</b> a hurry. “No, <b>I</b>'ll look first,” <b>she</b> said, “<b>and</b> see whether <b>it</b>'s marked «poison» <b>or</b> not'; for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> read several nice little histories about children who <b>had</b> got burnt, <b>and</b> eaten up <b>by</b> wild beasts <b>and</b> other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember <b>the</b> simple rules their friends <b>had</b> taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if your hold <b>it</b> too long; <b>and</b> that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, <b>it</b> usually bleeds; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” <b>it</b> <b>is</b> almost certain <b>to</b> disagree with you, sooner <b>or</b> later.
<br>However, this bottle <b>was</b> NOT marked “poison,” so <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> taste <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> finding <b>it</b> <b>very</b> nice, (<b>it</b> <b>had</b>, <b>in</b> fact, a sort <b>of</b> mixed flavour <b>of</b> cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, <b>and</b> hot buttered toast,) <b>she</b> <b>very</b> soon finished <b>it</b> off.
<br>“What a curious feeling!” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>I</b> must be shutting up like a telescope.”
<br>And so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> indeed: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now only ten inches high, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> face brightened up at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now <b>the</b> right size for going though <b>the</b> little door <b>into</b> that lovely garden. First, however, <b>she</b> waited for a few minutes <b>to</b> see if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> shrink any further: <b>she</b> felt a little nervous about this; “for <b>it</b> might end, you know,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, “<b>in</b> my going out altogether, like a candle. <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should be like then?” And <b>she</b> tried <b>to</b> fancy <b>what</b> <b>the</b> flame <b>of</b> a candle <b>is</b> like after <b>the</b> candle <b>is</b> blown out, for <b>she</b> could not remember ever <b>having</b> seen such a thing.
<br>After a while, finding that <b>nothing</b> more happened, <b>she</b> decided <b>on</b> going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden at <b>once</b>; <b>but</b>, alas for poor <b>Alice</b>! when <b>she</b> got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>she</b> found he <b>had</b> forgotten <b>the</b> little golden key, <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table for <b>it</b>, <b>she</b> found <b>she</b> could not possibly reach <b>it</b>: <b>she</b> could see <b>it</b> quite plainly through <b>the</b> glass, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> tried <b>her</b> best <b>to</b> climb up one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too slippery; <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>tired</b> herself out with trying, <b>the</b> poor little thing sat down <b>and</b> cried.
<br>“Come, there's <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> crying like that!” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, rather sharply; “<b>I</b> advise you <b>to</b> leave off this minute!” She generally gave herself <b>very</b> good advice, (though <b>she</b> <b>very</b> seldom followed <b>it</b>), <b>and</b> sometimes <b>she</b> scolded herself so severely as <b>to</b> bring tears <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes; <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>she</b> remembered trying <b>to</b> box <b>her</b> own ears for <b>having</b> cheated herself <b>in</b> a game <b>of</b> croquet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> playing against herself, for this curious child <b>was</b> <b>very</b> fond <b>of</b> pretending <b>to</b> be two people. “But <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> <b>use</b> now,” <b>thought</b> poor <b>Alice</b>, “<b>to</b> pretend <b>to</b> be two people! Why, there's hardly enough <b>of</b> me left <b>to</b> make ONE respectable person!”
<br>Soon <b>her</b> eye fell <b>on</b> a little glass box that <b>was</b> lying under <b>the</b> table: <b>she</b> opened <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> found <b>in</b> <b>it</b> a <b>very</b> small cake, <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked <b>in</b> currants. “Well, <b>I</b>'ll eat <b>it</b>,” said Alive, “<b>and</b> if <b>it</b> makes me grow larger, <b>I</b> can reach <b>the</b> key; <b>and</b> if <b>it</b> makes me grow smaller, <b>I</b> can creep under <b>the</b> door; so either way <b>I</b>'ll <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't care which happens!”
<br>She ate a little bit, <b>and</b> said anxiously <b>to</b> herself, “Which way? Which way?', holding <b>her</b> hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head <b>to</b> feel which way <b>it</b> <b>was</b> growing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite surprised <b>to</b> find that <b>she</b> remained <b>the</b> same size: <b>to</b> be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, <b>but</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> got so much <b>into</b> <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> expecting <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way things <b>to</b> happen, that <b>it</b> seemed quite dull <b>and</b> stupid for life <b>to</b> go <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common way.
<br>So <b>she</b> set <b>to</b> work, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> soon finished off <b>the</b> cake.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> II
<br><b>THE</b> POOL OF TEARS
<br>
<br>“Curiouser <b>and</b> curiouser!” cried <b>Alice</b> (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> so much surprised, that for <b>the</b> moment <b>she</b> quite forgot how <b>to</b> speak good English); “now <b>I</b>'m opening out like <b>the</b> largest telescope that ever <b>was</b>! Good-bye, feet!” (for when <b>she</b> looked down at <b>her</b> feet, they seemed <b>to</b> be almost out <b>of</b> sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, <b>I</b> wonder who will put <b>on</b> your shoes <b>and</b> stockings for you now, dears? <b>I</b>'m sure _<b>I</b>_ shan't be able! <b>I</b> shall be a great deal too far off <b>to</b> trouble myself about you: you must manage <b>the</b> best way you can; —<b>but</b> <b>I</b> must be kind <b>to</b> them,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “<b>or</b> perhaps they won't walk <b>the</b> way <b>I</b> want <b>to</b> go! Let me see: <b>I</b>'ll give them a new pair <b>of</b> boots every Christmas.”
<br>And <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> planning <b>to</b> herself how <b>she</b> would manage <b>it</b>. “They must go <b>by</b> <b>the</b> carrier,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>; “<b>and</b> how funny <b>it</b>'ll seem, sending presents <b>to</b> one's own feet! And how odd <b>the</b> directions will look!
<br>
<br>ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
<br>HEARTHRUG,
<br>NEAR <b>THE</b> FENDER,
<br>(WITH ALICE'S LOVE).
<br>
<br>Oh dear, <b>what</b> nonsense <b>I</b>'m talking!”
<br>Just then <b>her</b> head struck against <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall: <b>in</b> fact <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now more than nine feet high, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> at <b>once</b> took up <b>the</b> little golden key <b>and</b> hurried off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden door.
<br>Poor <b>Alice</b>! It <b>was</b> as much as <b>she</b> could <b>do</b>, lying down <b>on</b> one side, <b>to</b> look through <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden with one eye; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through <b>was</b> more hopeless than ever: <b>she</b> sat down <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> cry again.
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> be ashamed <b>of</b> yourself,” said <b>Alice</b>, “a great girl like you,” (<b>she</b> might well say this), “<b>to</b> go <b>on</b> crying <b>in</b> this way! Stop this moment, <b>I</b> tell you!” But <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> same, shedding gallons <b>of</b> tears, until there <b>was</b> a large pool all round <b>her</b>, about four inches deep <b>and</b> reaching half down <b>the</b> hall.
<br>After a time <b>she</b> heard a little pattering <b>of</b> feet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> hastily dried <b>her</b> eyes <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> coming. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair <b>of</b> white kid gloves <b>in</b> one hand <b>and</b> a large fan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other: he came trotting along <b>in</b> a great hurry, muttering <b>to</b> himself as he came, “Oh! <b>the</b> Duchess, <b>the</b> Duchess! Oh! won't <b>she</b> be savage if <b>I</b>'ve kept <b>her</b> waiting!” <b>Alice</b> felt so desperate that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> ready <b>to</b> ask help <b>of</b> any one; so, when <b>the</b> Rabbit came near <b>her</b>, <b>she</b> began, <b>in</b> a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped <b>the</b> white kid gloves <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fan, <b>and</b> skurried away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> darkness as hard as he could go.
<br><b>Alice</b> took up <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> gloves, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> hall <b>was</b> <b>very</b> hot, <b>she</b> kept fanning herself all <b>the</b> time <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything <b>is</b> <b>to</b>-day! And yesterday things went <b>on</b> just as usual. <b>I</b> wonder if <b>I</b>'ve been changed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night? Let me think: <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>the</b> same when <b>I</b> got up this morning? <b>I</b> almost think <b>I</b> can remember feeling a little different. But if <b>I</b>'m not <b>the</b> same, <b>the</b> next question <b>is</b>, Who <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world am <b>I</b>? Ah, THAT'S <b>the</b> great puzzle!” And <b>she</b> began thinking over all <b>the</b> children <b>she</b> knew that were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same age as herself, <b>to</b> see if <b>she</b> could have been changed for any <b>of</b> them.
<br>“<b>I</b>'m sure <b>I</b>'m not Ada,” <b>she</b> said, “for <b>her</b> hair goes <b>in</b> such long ringlets, <b>and</b> mine doesn't go <b>in</b> ringlets at all; <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'m sure <b>I</b> can't be Mabel, for <b>I</b> know all sorts <b>of</b> things, <b>and</b> <b>she</b>, oh! <b>she</b> knows such a <b>very</b> little! Besides, SHE'S <b>she</b>, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'m <b>I</b>, <b>and</b>—oh dear, how puzzling <b>it</b> all <b>is</b>! <b>I</b>'ll try if <b>I</b> know all <b>the</b> things <b>I</b> used <b>to</b> know. Let me see: four times five <b>is</b> twelve, <b>and</b> four times six <b>is</b> thirteen, <b>and</b> four times seven <b>is</b>—oh dear! <b>I</b> shall never <b>get</b> <b>to</b> twenty at that rate! However, <b>the</b> Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London <b>is</b> <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Paris, <b>and</b> Paris <b>is</b> <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> Rome, <b>and</b> Rome—<b>no</b>, THAT'S all wrong, <b>I</b>'m certain! <b>I</b> must have been changed for Mabel! <b>I</b>'ll try <b>and</b> say «How doth <b>the</b> little— «” <b>and</b> <b>she</b> crossed <b>her</b> hands <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lap as if <b>she</b> were saying lessons, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> voice sounded hoarse <b>and</b> strange, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words did not come <b>the</b> same as they used <b>to</b> <b>do</b>:—
<br>“How doth <b>the</b> little crocodile
<br>Improve his shining tail,
<br>And pour <b>the</b> waters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nile
<br>On every golden scale!
<br>“How cheerfully he seems <b>to</b> grin,
<br>How neatly spread his claws,
<br>And welcome little fishes <b>in</b>
<br>With gently smiling jaws!”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m sure those are not <b>the</b> right words,” said poor <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes filled with tears again as <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, “<b>I</b> must be Mabel after all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall have <b>to</b> go <b>and</b> live <b>in</b> that poky little house, <b>and</b> have next <b>to</b> <b>no</b> toys <b>to</b> play with, <b>and</b> oh! ever so many lessons <b>to</b> learn! No, <b>I</b>'ve made up my mind about <b>it</b>; if <b>I</b>'m Mabel, <b>I</b>'ll stay down here! It'll be <b>no</b> <b>use</b> their putting their heads down <b>and</b> saying «Come up again, dear!» <b>I</b> shall only look up <b>and</b> say «Who am <b>I</b> then? Tell me that first, <b>and</b> then, if <b>I</b> like being that person, <b>I</b>'ll come up: if not, <b>I</b>'ll stay down here till <b>I</b>'m somebody else"—<b>but</b>, oh dear!” cried <b>Alice</b>, with a sudden burst <b>of</b> tears, “<b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish they WOULD put their heads down! <b>I</b> am so VERY <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being all alone here!”
<br>As <b>she</b> said this <b>she</b> looked down at <b>her</b> hands, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> surprised <b>to</b> see that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> put <b>on</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit's little white kid gloves while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> talking. “How CAN <b>I</b> have done that?” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>. “<b>I</b> must be growing small again.” She got up <b>and</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table <b>to</b> measure herself <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> found that, as nearly as <b>she</b> could guess, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now about two feet high, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going <b>on</b> shrinking rapidly: <b>she</b> soon found out that <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fan <b>she</b> <b>was</b> holding, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> dropped <b>it</b> hastily, just <b>in</b> time <b>to</b> avoid shrinking away altogether.
<br>“That WAS a narrow escape!” said <b>Alice</b>, a good deal frightened at <b>the</b> sudden change, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> glad <b>to</b> find herself still <b>in</b> existence; “<b>and</b> now for <b>the</b> garden!” <b>and</b> <b>she</b> ran with all speed back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little door: <b>but</b>, alas! <b>the</b> little door <b>was</b> shut again, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little golden key <b>was</b> lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> glass table as before, “<b>and</b> things are worse than ever,” <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> poor child, “for <b>I</b> never <b>was</b> so small as this before, never! And <b>I</b> declare <b>it</b>'s too bad, that <b>it</b> <b>is</b>!”
<br>As <b>she</b> said these words <b>her</b> foot slipped, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> another moment, splash! <b>she</b> <b>was</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chin <b>in</b> salt water. He first idea <b>was</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> somehow fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea, “<b>and</b> <b>in</b> that case <b>I</b> can go back <b>by</b> railway,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself. (<b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> been <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seaside <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general conclusion, that wherever you go <b>to</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> English coast you find a number <b>of</b> bathing machines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea, some children digging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sand with wooden spades, then a row <b>of</b> lodging houses, <b>and</b> behind them a railway station.) However, <b>she</b> soon made out that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool <b>of</b> tears which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wept when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> nine feet high.
<br>“<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> hadn't cried so much!” said <b>Alice</b>, as <b>she</b> swam about, trying <b>to</b> find <b>her</b> way out. “<b>I</b> shall be punished for <b>it</b> now, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>by</b> being drowned <b>in</b> my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, <b>to</b> be sure! However, everything <b>is</b> queer <b>to</b>-day.”
<br>Just then <b>she</b> heard something splashing about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool a little way off, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> swam nearer <b>to</b> make out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b>: at first <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> must be a walrus <b>or</b> hippopotamus, <b>but</b> then <b>she</b> remembered how small <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> soon made out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only a mouse that <b>had</b> slipped <b>in</b> like herself.
<br>“Would <b>it</b> be <b>of</b> any <b>use</b>, now,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “<b>to</b> speak <b>to</b> this mouse? Everything <b>is</b> so out-<b>of</b>-<b>the</b>-way down here, that <b>I</b> should think <b>very</b> likely <b>it</b> can talk: at any rate, there's <b>no</b> harm <b>in</b> trying.” So <b>she</b> began: “O Mouse, <b>do</b> you know <b>the</b> way out <b>of</b> this pool? <b>I</b> am <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> swimming about here, O Mouse!” (<b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> this must be <b>the</b> right way <b>of</b> speaking <b>to</b> a mouse: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never done such a thing before, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> remembered <b>having</b> seen <b>in</b> <b>her</b> brother's Latin Grammar, “A mouse—<b>of</b> a mouse—<b>to</b> a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!” The Mouse looked at <b>her</b> rather inquisitively, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> wink with one <b>of</b> its little eyes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> said <b>nothing</b>.
<br>“Perhaps <b>it</b> doesn't understand English,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>; “<b>I</b> daresay <b>it</b>'s a French mouse, come over with William <b>the</b> Conqueror.” (For, with all <b>her</b> knowledge <b>of</b> history, <b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>very</b> clear notion how long ago anything <b>had</b> happened.) So <b>she</b> began again: “Ou est ma chatte?” which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first sentence <b>in</b> <b>her</b> French lesson-<b>book</b>. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, <b>and</b> seemed <b>to</b> quiver all over with fright. “Oh, <b>I</b> beg your pardon!” cried <b>Alice</b> hastily, afraid that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hurt <b>the</b> poor animal's feelings. “<b>I</b> quite forgot you didn't like cats.”
<br>“Not like cats!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, <b>in</b> a shrill, passionate voice. “Would YOU like cats if you were me?”
<br>“Well, perhaps not,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a soothing tone: “don't be angry about <b>it</b>. And yet <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> could show you our cat Dinah: <b>I</b> think you'd take a fancy <b>to</b> cats if you could only see <b>her</b>. She <b>is</b> such a dear quiet thing,” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b>, half <b>to</b> herself, as <b>she</b> swam lazily about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool, “<b>and</b> <b>she</b> sits purring so nicely <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fire, licking <b>her</b> paws <b>and</b> washing <b>her</b> face—<b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> such a nice soft thing <b>to</b> nurse—<b>and</b> <b>she</b>'s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, <b>I</b> beg your pardon!” cried <b>Alice</b> again, for this time <b>the</b> Mouse <b>was</b> bristling all over, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> felt certain <b>it</b> must be really offended. “We won't talk about <b>her</b> any more if you'd rather not.”
<br>“We indeed!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, who <b>was</b> trembling down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> his tail. “As if <b>I</b> would talk <b>on</b> such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear <b>the</b> name again!”
<br>“<b>I</b> won't indeed!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>in</b> a great hurry <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b>. “Are you—are you fond—<b>of</b>—<b>of</b> dogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b> eagerly: “There <b>is</b> such a nice little dog near our house <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And <b>it</b>'ll fetch things when you throw them, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>'ll sit up <b>and</b> beg for its dinner, <b>and</b> all sorts <b>of</b> thins—<b>I</b> can't remember half <b>of</b> them—<b>and</b> <b>it</b> belongs <b>to</b> a farmer, you know, <b>and</b> he says <b>it</b>'s so useful, <b>it</b>'s worth a hundred pounds! He says <b>it</b> kills all <b>the</b> rats <b>and</b>—oh dear!” cried <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a sorrowful tone, “<b>I</b>'m afraid <b>I</b>'ve offended <b>it</b> again!” For <b>the</b> Mouse <b>was</b> swimming away from <b>her</b> as hard as <b>it</b> could go, <b>and</b> making quite a commotion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool as <b>it</b> went.
<br>So <b>she</b> called softly after <b>it</b>, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, <b>and</b> we won't talk about cats <b>or</b> dogs either, if you don't like them!” When <b>the</b> Mouse heard this, <b>it</b> turned round <b>and</b> swam slowly back <b>to</b> <b>her</b>: its face <b>was</b> quite pale (with passion, <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b>), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> said <b>in</b> a low trembling voice, “Let us <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b>'ll tell you my history, <b>and</b> you'll understand why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> hate cats <b>and</b> dogs.”
<br>It <b>was</b> high time <b>to</b> go, for <b>the</b> pool <b>was</b> getting quite crowded with <b>the</b> birds <b>and</b> animals that <b>had</b> fallen <b>into</b> <b>it</b>: there were a Duck <b>and</b> a Dodo, a Lory <b>and</b> an Eaglet, <b>and</b> several other curious creatures. <b>Alice</b> led <b>the</b> way, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whole party swam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> III
<br>A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE
<br>
<br>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>—<b>the</b> birds with draggled feathers, <b>the</b> animals with their fur clinging close <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> all dripping wet, cross, <b>and</b> uncomfortable.
<br>The first question <b>of</b> course <b>was</b>, how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dry again: they <b>had</b> a consultation about this, <b>and</b> after a few minutes <b>it</b> seemed quite natural <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> find herself talking familiarly with them, as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> known them all <b>her</b> life. Indeed, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> quite a long argument with <b>the</b> Lory, who at last turned sulky, <b>and</b> would only say, “<b>I</b> am older than you, <b>and</b> must know better'; <b>and</b> this <b>Alice</b> would not allow <b>without</b> knowing how old <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> Lory positively refused <b>to</b> tell its age, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> more <b>to</b> be said.
<br>At last <b>the</b> Mouse, who seemed <b>to</b> be a person <b>of</b> authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> listen <b>to</b> me! <b>I</b>'LL soon make you dry enough!” They all sat down at <b>once</b>, <b>in</b> a large ring, with <b>the</b> Mouse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle. <b>Alice</b> kept <b>her</b> eyes anxiously fixed <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, for <b>she</b> felt sure <b>she</b> would catch a bad cold if <b>she</b> did not <b>get</b> dry <b>very</b> soon.
<br>“Ahem!” said <b>the</b> Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> driest thing <b>I</b> know. Silence all round, if you please! «William <b>the</b> Conqueror, whose cause <b>was</b> favoured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pope, <b>was</b> soon submitted <b>to</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English, who wanted leaders, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> been <b>of</b> late much accustomed <b>to</b> usurpation <b>and</b> conquest. Edwin <b>and</b> Morcar, <b>the</b> earls <b>of</b> Mercia <b>and</b> Northumbria- -"“
<br>“Ugh!” said <b>the</b> Lory, with a shiver.
<br>“<b>I</b> beg your pardon!” said <b>the</b> Mouse, frowning, <b>but</b> <b>very</b> politely: “Did you speak?”
<br>“Not <b>I</b>!” said <b>the</b> Lory hastily.
<br>“<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> you did,” said <b>the</b> Mouse. “—<b>I</b> proceed. «Edwin <b>and</b> Morcar, <b>the</b> earls <b>of</b> Mercia <b>and</b> Northumbria, declared for him: <b>and</b> even Stigand, <b>the</b> patriotic archbishop <b>of</b> Canterbury, found <b>it</b> advisable—"“
<br>“Found WHAT?” said <b>the</b> Duck.
<br>“Found IT,” <b>the</b> Mouse replied rather crossly: “<b>of</b> course you know <b>what</b> «<b>it</b>» means.”
<br>“<b>I</b> know <b>what</b> «<b>it</b>» means well enough, when <b>I</b> find a thing,” said <b>the</b> Duck: “<b>it</b>'s generally a frog <b>or</b> a worm. The question <b>is</b>, <b>what</b> did <b>the</b> archbishop find?”
<br>The Mouse did not notice this question, <b>but</b> hurriedly went <b>on</b>, “"—found <b>it</b> advisable <b>to</b> go with Edgar Atheling <b>to</b> meet William <b>and</b> offer him <b>the</b> crown. William's conduct at first <b>was</b> moderate. But <b>the</b> insolence <b>of</b> his Normans—» How are you getting <b>on</b> now, my dear?” <b>it</b> continued, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> as <b>it</b> spoke.
<br>“As wet as ever,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a melancholy tone: “<b>it</b> doesn't seem <b>to</b> dry me at all.”
<br>“In that case,” said <b>the</b> Dodo solemnly, rising <b>to</b> its feet, “<b>I</b> move that <b>the</b> meeting adjourn, for <b>the</b> immediate adoption <b>of</b> more energetic remedies—”
<br>“Speak English!” said <b>the</b> Eaglet. “<b>I</b> don't know <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> half those long words, <b>and</b>, <b>what</b>'s more, <b>I</b> don't believe you <b>do</b> either!” And <b>the</b> Eaglet bent down its head <b>to</b> hide a smile: some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other birds tittered audibly.
<br>“What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> say,” said <b>the</b> Dodo <b>in</b> an offended tone, “<b>was</b>, that <b>the</b> best thing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
<br>“What IS a Caucus-race?” said <b>Alice</b>; not that <b>she</b> wanted much <b>to</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Dodo <b>had</b> paused as if <b>it</b> <b>thought</b> that SOMEBODY ought <b>to</b> speak, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> one else seemed inclined <b>to</b> say anything.
<br>“Why,” said <b>the</b> Dodo, “<b>the</b> best way <b>to</b> explain <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b>.” (And, as you might like <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> thing yourself, some winter day, <b>I</b> will tell you how <b>the</b> Dodo managed <b>it</b>.)
<br>First <b>it</b> marked out a race-course, <b>in</b> a sort <b>of</b> circle, (`<b>the</b> exact shape doesn't matter,” <b>it</b> said,) <b>and</b> then all <b>the</b> party were placed along <b>the</b> course, here <b>and</b> there. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> “One, two, three, <b>and</b> away,” <b>but</b> they began running when they liked, <b>and</b> left off when they liked, so that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not easy <b>to</b> know when <b>the</b> race <b>was</b> over. However, when they <b>had</b> been running half an hour <b>or</b> so, <b>and</b> were quite dry again, <b>the</b> Dodo suddenly called out “The race <b>is</b> over!” <b>and</b> they all crowded round <b>it</b>, panting, <b>and</b> asking, “But who has won?”
<br>This question <b>the</b> Dodo could not answer <b>without</b> a great deal <b>of</b> <b>thought</b>, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (<b>the</b> position <b>in</b> which you usually see Shakespeare, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> him), while <b>the</b> rest waited <b>in</b> silence. At last <b>the</b> Dodo said, “EVERYBODY has won, <b>and</b> all must have prizes.”
<br>“But who <b>is</b> <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> prizes?” quite a chorus <b>of</b> voices asked.
<br>“Why, SHE, <b>of</b> course,” said <b>the</b> Dodo, pointing <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> with one finger; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> whole party at <b>once</b> crowded round <b>her</b>, calling out <b>in</b> a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> despair <b>she</b> put <b>her</b> hand <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket, <b>and</b> pulled out a box <b>of</b> comfits, (luckily <b>the</b> salt water <b>had</b> not got <b>into</b> <b>it</b>), <b>and</b> handed them round as prizes. There <b>was</b> exactly one a-piece all round.
<br>“But <b>she</b> must have a prize herself, you know,” said <b>the</b> Mouse.
<br>“Of course,” <b>the</b> Dodo replied <b>very</b> gravely. “What else have you got <b>in</b> your pocket?” he went <b>on</b>, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Only a thimble,” said <b>Alice</b> sadly.
<br>“Hand <b>it</b> over here,” said <b>the</b> Dodo.
<br>Then they all crowded round <b>her</b> <b>once</b> more, while <b>the</b> Dodo solemnly presented <b>the</b> thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance <b>of</b> this elegant thimble'; <b>and</b>, when <b>it</b> <b>had</b> finished this short speech, they all cheered.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> whole thing <b>very</b> absurd, <b>but</b> they all looked so grave that <b>she</b> did not dare <b>to</b> laugh; <b>and</b>, as <b>she</b> could not think <b>of</b> anything <b>to</b> say, <b>she</b> simply bowed, <b>and</b> took <b>the</b> thimble, looking as solemn as <b>she</b> could.
<br>The next thing <b>was</b> <b>to</b> eat <b>the</b> comfits: this caused some noise <b>and</b> confusion, as <b>the</b> large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> small ones choked <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be patted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> over at last, <b>and</b> they sat down again <b>in</b> a ring, <b>and</b> begged <b>the</b> Mouse <b>to</b> tell them something more.
<br>“You promised <b>to</b> tell me your history, you know,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>and</b> why <b>it</b> <b>is</b> you hate—C <b>and</b> D,” <b>she</b> added <b>in</b> a whisper, half afraid that <b>it</b> would be offended again.
<br>“Mine <b>is</b> a long <b>and</b> a sad tale!” said <b>the</b> Mouse, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> sighing.
<br>“It IS a long tail, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b>, looking down with wonder at <b>the</b> Mouse's tail” “<b>but</b> why <b>do</b> you call <b>it</b> sad?” And <b>she</b> kept <b>on</b> puzzling about <b>it</b> while <b>the</b> Mouse <b>was</b> speaking, so that <b>her</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tale <b>was</b> something like this:—
<br>
<br>“Fury said <b>to</b> a mouse,
<br>That he met <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house,
<br>«Let us both go <b>to</b> law: <b>I</b> will prosecute YOU.
<br>
<br>—Come, <b>I</b>'ll take <b>no</b> denial;
<br>We must have a trial:
<br>For really this morning <b>I</b>'ve <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>.»
<br>
<br>Said <b>the</b> mouse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cur,
<br>«Such a trial, dear Sir,
<br>With <b>no</b> jury <b>or</b> judge,
<br>would be wasting our breath.»
<br>
<br>«<b>I</b>'ll be judge, <b>I</b>'ll be jury,»
<br>Said cunning old Fury:
<br>«<b>I</b>'ll try <b>the</b> whole cause,
<br><b>and</b> condemn you <b>to</b> death.»
<br>
<br>“You are not attending!” said <b>the</b> Mouse <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> severely. “What are you thinking <b>of</b>?”
<br>“<b>I</b> beg your pardon,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>very</b> humbly: “you <b>had</b> got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fifth bend, <b>I</b> think?”
<br>“<b>I</b> <b>had</b> NOT!” cried <b>the</b> Mouse, sharply <b>and</b> <b>very</b> angrily.
<br>“A knot!” said <b>Alice</b>, always ready <b>to</b> make herself useful, <b>and</b> looking anxiously about <b>her</b>. “Oh, <b>do</b> let me help <b>to</b> undo <b>it</b>!”
<br>“<b>I</b> shall <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort,” said <b>the</b> Mouse, getting up <b>and</b> walking away. “You insult me <b>by</b> talking such nonsense!”
<br>“<b>I</b> didn't mean <b>it</b>!” pleaded poor <b>Alice</b>. “But you're so easily offended, you know!”
<br>The Mouse only growled <b>in</b> reply.
<br>“Please come back <b>and</b> finish your story!” <b>Alice</b> called after <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others all joined <b>in</b> chorus, “Yes, please <b>do</b>!” <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Mouse only shook its head impatiently, <b>and</b> walked a little quicker.
<br>“What a pity <b>it</b> wouldn't stay!” sighed <b>the</b> Lory, as soon as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite out <b>of</b> sight; <b>and</b> an old Crab took <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> saying <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson <b>to</b> you never <b>to</b> lose YOUR temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said <b>the</b> young Crab, a little snappishly. “You're enough <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> patience <b>of</b> an oyster!”
<br>“<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> our Dinah here, <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>do</b>!” said <b>Alice</b> aloud, addressing nobody <b>in</b> particular. “She'd soon fetch <b>it</b> back!”
<br>“And who <b>is</b> Dinah, if <b>I</b> might venture <b>to</b> ask <b>the</b> question?” said <b>the</b> Lory.
<br><b>Alice</b> replied eagerly, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> always ready <b>to</b> talk about <b>her</b> pet: “Dinah's our cat. And <b>she</b>'s such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, <b>I</b> wish you could see <b>her</b> after <b>the</b> birds! Why, <b>she</b>'ll eat a little bird as soon as look at <b>it</b>!”
<br>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among <b>the</b> party. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds hurried off at <b>once</b>: one <b>the</b> old Magpie began wrapping itself up <b>very</b> carefully, remarking, “<b>I</b> really must be getting home; <b>the</b> night-air doesn't suit my throat!” <b>and</b> a Canary called out <b>in</b> a trembling voice <b>to</b> its children, “Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all <b>in</b> bed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> soon left alone.
<br>“<b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> hadn't mentioned Dinah!” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself <b>in</b> a melancholy tone. “Nobody seems <b>to</b> like <b>her</b>, down here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'m sure <b>she</b>'s <b>the</b> best cat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world! Oh, my dear Dinah! <b>I</b> wonder if <b>I</b> shall ever see you any more!” And here poor <b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> cry again, for <b>she</b> felt <b>very</b> lonely <b>and</b> low-spirited. In a little while, however, <b>she</b> again heard a little pattering <b>of</b> footsteps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> looked up eagerly, half hoping that <b>the</b> Mouse <b>had</b> changed his mind, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> coming back <b>to</b> finish his story.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> IV
<br><b>THE</b> <b>RABBIT</b> SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL
<br>
<br>It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, <b>and</b> looking anxiously about as <b>it</b> went, as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> lost something; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> heard <b>it</b> muttering <b>to</b> itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur <b>and</b> whiskers! She'll <b>get</b> me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN <b>I</b> have dropped them, <b>I</b> wonder?” <b>Alice</b> guessed <b>in</b> a moment that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> looking for <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pair <b>of</b> white kid gloves, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>very</b> good-naturedly began hunting about for them, <b>but</b> they were nowhere <b>to</b> be seen—everything seemed <b>to</b> have changed since <b>her</b> swim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pool, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> great hall, with <b>the</b> glass table <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little door, <b>had</b> vanished completely.
<br>Very soon <b>the</b> Rabbit noticed <b>Alice</b>, as <b>she</b> went hunting about, <b>and</b> called out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, <b>what</b> ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, <b>and</b> fetch me a pair <b>of</b> gloves <b>and</b> a fan! Quick, now!” And <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> so much frightened that <b>she</b> ran off at <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>it</b> pointed <b>to</b>, <b>without</b> trying <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> mistake <b>it</b> <b>had</b> made.
<br>“He took me for his housemaid,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself as <b>she</b> ran. “How surprised he'll be when he finds out who <b>I</b> am! But <b>I</b>'d better take him his fan <b>and</b> gloves—that <b>is</b>, if <b>I</b> can find them.” As <b>she</b> said this, <b>she</b> came upon a neat little house, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> which <b>was</b> a bright brass plate with <b>the</b> name “W. <b>RABBIT</b>” engraved upon <b>it</b>. She went <b>in</b> <b>without</b> knocking, <b>and</b> hurried upstairs, <b>in</b> great fear lest <b>she</b> should meet <b>the</b> real Mary Ann, <b>and</b> be turned out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> found <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> gloves.
<br>“How queer <b>it</b> seems,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> herself, “<b>to</b> be going messages for a rabbit! <b>I</b> suppose Dinah'll be sending me <b>on</b> messages next!” And <b>she</b> began fancying <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> thing that would happen: “"Miss <b>Alice</b>! Come here directly, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> ready for your walk!» «Coming <b>in</b> a minute, nurse! But <b>I</b>'ve got <b>to</b> see that <b>the</b> mouse doesn't <b>get</b> out.» Only <b>I</b> don't think,” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b>, “that they'd let Dinah stop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house if <b>it</b> began ordering people about like that!”
<br>By this time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> found <b>her</b> way <b>into</b> a tidy little room with a table <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> (as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hoped) a fan <b>and</b> two <b>or</b> three pairs <b>of</b> tiny white kid gloves: <b>she</b> took up <b>the</b> fan <b>and</b> a pair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gloves, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> just going <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> room, when <b>her</b> eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near <b>the</b> looking- glass. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> label this time with <b>the</b> words “DRINK ME,” <b>but</b> nevertheless <b>she</b> uncorked <b>it</b> <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lips. “<b>I</b> know SOMETHING interesting <b>is</b> sure <b>to</b> happen,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, “whenever <b>I</b> eat <b>or</b> drink anything; so <b>I</b>'ll just see <b>what</b> this bottle does. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope <b>it</b>'ll make me grow large again, for really <b>I</b>'m quite <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> being such a tiny little thing!”
<br>It did so indeed, <b>and</b> much sooner than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> expected: before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> drunk half <b>the</b> bottle, <b>she</b> found <b>her</b> head pressing against <b>the</b> ceiling, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stoop <b>to</b> save <b>her</b> neck from being broken. She hastily put down <b>the</b> bottle, saying <b>to</b> herself “That's quite enough—<b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> shan't grow any more—As <b>it</b> <b>is</b>, <b>I</b> can't <b>get</b> out at <b>the</b> door—<b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish <b>I</b> hadn't drunk quite so much!”
<br>Alas! <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too late <b>to</b> wish that! She went <b>on</b> growing, <b>and</b> growing, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> soon <b>had</b> <b>to</b> kneel down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor: <b>in</b> another minute there <b>was</b> not even room for this, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> tried <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> lying down with one elbow against <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other arm curled round <b>her</b> head. Still <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> growing, <b>and</b>, as a last resource, <b>she</b> put one arm out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> one foot up <b>the</b> chimney, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> herself “Now <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> more, whatever happens. What WILL become <b>of</b> me?”
<br>Luckily for <b>Alice</b>, <b>the</b> little magic bottle <b>had</b> now <b>had</b> its full effect, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> grew <b>no</b> larger: still <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> uncomfortable, <b>and</b>, as there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> chance <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ever getting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room again, <b>no</b> wonder <b>she</b> felt unhappy.
<br>“It <b>was</b> much pleasanter at home,” <b>thought</b> poor <b>Alice</b>, “when one wasn't always growing larger <b>and</b> smaller, <b>and</b> being ordered about <b>by</b> mice <b>and</b> rabbits. <b>I</b> almost wish <b>I</b> hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—<b>and</b> yet—<b>and</b> yet—<b>it</b>'s rather curious, you know, this sort <b>of</b> life! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wonder <b>what</b> CAN have happened <b>to</b> me! When <b>I</b> used <b>to</b> read fairy-tales, <b>I</b> fancied that kind <b>of</b> thing never happened, <b>and</b> now here <b>I</b> am <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> one! There ought <b>to</b> be a <b>book</b> written about me, that there ought! And when <b>I</b> grow up, <b>I</b>'ll write one—<b>but</b> <b>I</b>'m grown up now,” <b>she</b> added <b>in</b> a sorrowful tone; “at least there's <b>no</b> room <b>to</b> grow up any more HERE.”
<br>“But then,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “shall <b>I</b> NEVER <b>get</b> any older than <b>I</b> am now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never <b>to</b> be an old woman- -<b>but</b> then—always <b>to</b> have lessons <b>to</b> learn! Oh, <b>I</b> shouldn't like THAT!”
<br>“Oh, you foolish <b>Alice</b>!” <b>she</b> answered herself. “How can you learn lessons <b>in</b> here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> room at all for any lesson-books!”
<br>And so <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, taking first one side <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> other, <b>and</b> making quite a <b>conversation</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> altogether; <b>but</b> after a few minutes <b>she</b> heard a voice outside, <b>and</b> stopped <b>to</b> listen.
<br>“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said <b>the</b> voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!” Then came a little pattering <b>of</b> feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stairs. <b>Alice</b> knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Rabbit coming <b>to</b> look for <b>her</b>, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> trembled till <b>she</b> shook <b>the</b> house, quite forgetting that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now about a thousand times as large as <b>the</b> Rabbit, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> reason <b>to</b> be afraid <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>Presently <b>the</b> Rabbit came up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> open <b>it</b>; <b>but</b>, as <b>the</b> door opened inwards, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>'s elbow <b>was</b> pressed hard against <b>it</b>, that attempt proved a failure. <b>Alice</b> heard <b>it</b> say <b>to</b> itself “Then <b>I</b>'ll go round <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> window.”
<br>“THAT you won't” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b>, after waiting till <b>she</b> fancied <b>she</b> heard <b>the</b> Rabbit just under <b>the</b> window, <b>she</b> suddenly spread out <b>her</b> hand, <b>and</b> made a snatch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. She did not <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> anything, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> heard a little shriek <b>and</b> a fall, <b>and</b> a crash <b>of</b> broken glass, from which <b>she</b> concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just possible <b>it</b> <b>had</b> fallen <b>into</b> a cucumber-frame, <b>or</b> something <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort.
<br>Next came an angry voice—<b>the</b> Rabbit's—`Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And then a voice <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never heard before, “Sure then <b>I</b>'m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”
<br>“Digging for apples, indeed!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come <b>and</b> help me out <b>of</b> THIS!” (Sounds <b>of</b> more broken glass.)
<br>“Now tell me, Pat, <b>what</b>'s that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window?”
<br>“Sure, <b>it</b>'s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced <b>it</b> “arrum.')
<br>“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, <b>it</b> fills <b>the</b> whole window!”
<br>“Sure, <b>it</b> does, yer honour: <b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s an arm for all that.”
<br>“Well, <b>it</b>'s got <b>no</b> business there, at any rate: go <b>and</b> take <b>it</b> away!”
<br>There <b>was</b> a long silence after this, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> could only hear whispers now <b>and</b> then; such as, “Sure, <b>I</b> don't like <b>it</b>, yer honour, at all, at all!” “Do as <b>I</b> tell you, you coward!” <b>and</b> at last <b>she</b> spread out <b>her</b> hand again, <b>and</b> made another snatch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, <b>and</b> more sounds <b>of</b> broken glass. “What a number <b>of</b> cucumber-frames there must be!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> they'll <b>do</b> next! As for pulling me out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> window, <b>I</b> only wish they COULD! <b>I</b>'m sure <b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> stay <b>in</b> here any longer!”
<br>She waited for some time <b>without</b> hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling <b>of</b> little cartwheels, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> a good many voice all talking together: <b>she</b> made out <b>the</b> words: “Where's <b>the</b> other ladder?—Why, <b>I</b> hadn't <b>to</b> bring <b>but</b> one; Bill's got <b>the</b> other—Bill! fetch <b>it</b> here, lad!—Here, put 'em up at this corner—No, tie 'em together first—they don't reach half high enough yet—Oh! they'll <b>do</b> well enough; don't be particular- -Here, Bill! catch hold <b>of</b> this rope—Will <b>the</b> roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, <b>it</b>'s coming down! Heads below!” (a loud crash)—`Now, who did that?—It <b>was</b> Bill, <b>I</b> fancy—Who's <b>to</b> go down <b>the</b> chimney?—Nay, <b>I</b> shan't! YOU <b>do</b> <b>it</b>!—That <b>I</b> won't, then!—Bill's <b>to</b> go down—Here, Bill! <b>the</b> master says you're <b>to</b> go down <b>the</b> chimney!”
<br>“Oh! So Bill's got <b>to</b> come down <b>the</b> chimney, has he?” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself. “Shy, they seem <b>to</b> put everything upon Bill! <b>I</b> wouldn't be <b>in</b> Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace <b>is</b> narrow, <b>to</b> be sure; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> THINK <b>I</b> can kick a little!”
<br>She drew <b>her</b> foot as far down <b>the</b> chimney as <b>she</b> could, <b>and</b> waited till <b>she</b> heard a little animal (<b>she</b> couldn't guess <b>of</b> <b>what</b> sort <b>it</b> <b>was</b>) scratching <b>and</b> scrambling about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chimney close above <b>her</b>: then, saying <b>to</b> herself “This <b>is</b> Bill,” <b>she</b> gave one sharp kick, <b>and</b> waited <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> would happen next.
<br>The first thing <b>she</b> heard <b>was</b> a general chorus <b>of</b> “There goes Bill!” then <b>the</b> Rabbit's voice along—`Catch him, you <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hedge!” then silence, <b>and</b> then another confusion <b>of</b> voices—`Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don't choke him—How <b>was</b> <b>it</b>, old fellow? What happened <b>to</b> you? Tell us all about <b>it</b>!”
<br>Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>,) “Well, <b>I</b> hardly know—No more, thank ye; <b>I</b>'m better now—<b>but</b> <b>I</b>'m a deal too flustered <b>to</b> tell you—all <b>I</b> know <b>is</b>, something comes at me like a Jack-<b>in</b>-<b>the</b>-box, <b>and</b> up <b>I</b> goes like a sky-rocket!”
<br>“So you did, old fellow!” said <b>the</b> others.
<br>“We must burn <b>the</b> house down!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit's voice; <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> called out as loud as <b>she</b> could, “If you <b>do</b>. <b>I</b>'ll set Dinah at you!”
<br>There <b>was</b> a dead silence instantly, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself, “<b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> they WILL <b>do</b> next! If they <b>had</b> any sense, they'd take <b>the</b> roof off.” After a minute <b>or</b> two, they began moving about again, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> heard <b>the</b> Rabbit say, “A barrowful will <b>do</b>, <b>to</b> begin with.”
<br>“A barrowful <b>of</b> WHAT?” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not long <b>to</b> doubt, for <b>the</b> next moment a shower <b>of</b> little pebbles came rattling <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> window, <b>and</b> some <b>of</b> them hit <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face. “<b>I</b>'ll put a stop <b>to</b> this,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> shouted out, “You'd better not <b>do</b> that again!” which produced another dead silence.
<br><b>Alice</b> noticed with some surprise that <b>the</b> pebbles were all turning <b>into</b> little cakes as they lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, <b>and</b> a bright idea came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> head. “If <b>I</b> eat one <b>of</b> these cakes,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>, “<b>it</b>'s sure <b>to</b> make SOME change <b>in</b> my size; <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> can't possibly make me larger, <b>it</b> must make me smaller, <b>I</b> suppose.”
<br>So <b>she</b> swallowed one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cakes, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> delighted <b>to</b> find that <b>she</b> began shrinking directly. As soon as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> small enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through <b>the</b> door, <b>she</b> ran out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> found quite a crowd <b>of</b> little animals <b>and</b> birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, being held up <b>by</b> two guinea-pigs, who were giving <b>it</b> something out <b>of</b> a bottle. They all made a rush at <b>Alice</b> <b>the</b> moment <b>she</b> appeared; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> ran off as hard as <b>she</b> could, <b>and</b> soon found herself safe <b>in</b> a thick wood.
<br>“The first thing <b>I</b>'ve got <b>to</b> <b>do</b>,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself, as <b>she</b> wandered about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood, “<b>is</b> <b>to</b> grow <b>to</b> my right size again; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> second thing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find my way <b>into</b> that lovely garden. <b>I</b> think that will be <b>the</b> best plan.”
<br>It sounded an excellent plan, <b>no</b> doubt, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> neatly <b>and</b> simply arranged; <b>the</b> only difficulty <b>was</b>, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not <b>the</b> smallest idea how <b>to</b> set about <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> peering about anxiously among <b>the</b> trees, a little sharp bark just over <b>her</b> head made <b>her</b> look up <b>in</b> a great hurry.
<br>An enormous puppy <b>was</b> looking down at <b>her</b> with large round eyes, <b>and</b> feebly stretching out one paw, trying <b>to</b> touch <b>her</b>. “Poor little thing!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>in</b> a coaxing tone, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> tried hard <b>to</b> whistle <b>to</b> <b>it</b>; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> terribly frightened all <b>the</b> time at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> might be hungry, <b>in</b> which case <b>it</b> would be <b>very</b> likely <b>to</b> eat <b>her</b> up <b>in</b> spite <b>of</b> all <b>her</b> coaxing.
<br>Hardly knowing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did, <b>she</b> picked up a little bit <b>of</b> stick, <b>and</b> held <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> puppy; whereupon <b>the</b> puppy jumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air off all its feet at <b>once</b>, with a yelp <b>of</b> delight, <b>and</b> rushed at <b>the</b> stick, <b>and</b> made believe <b>to</b> worry <b>it</b>; then <b>Alice</b> dodged behind a great thistle, <b>to</b> keep herself from being run over; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moment <b>she</b> appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other side, <b>the</b> puppy made another rush at <b>the</b> stick, <b>and</b> tumbled head over heels <b>in</b> its hurry <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; then <b>Alice</b>, thinking <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> like <b>having</b> a game <b>of</b> play with a cart-horse, <b>and</b> expecting every moment <b>to</b> be trampled under its feet, ran round <b>the</b> thistle again; then <b>the</b> puppy began a series <b>of</b> short charges at <b>the</b> stick, running a <b>very</b> little way forwards each time <b>and</b> a long way back, <b>and</b> barking hoarsely all <b>the</b> while, till at last <b>it</b> sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out <b>of</b> its mouth, <b>and</b> its great eyes half shut.
<br>This seemed <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> a good opportunity for making <b>her</b> escape; so <b>she</b> set off at <b>once</b>, <b>and</b> ran till <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> out <b>of</b> breath, <b>and</b> till <b>the</b> puppy's bark sounded quite faint <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance.
<br>“And yet <b>what</b> a dear little puppy <b>it</b> <b>was</b>!” said <b>Alice</b>, as <b>she</b> leant against a buttercup <b>to</b> rest herself, <b>and</b> fanned herself with one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves: “<b>I</b> should have liked teaching <b>it</b> tricks <b>very</b> much, if—if <b>I</b>'d only been <b>the</b> right size <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b>! Oh dear! <b>I</b>'d nearly forgotten that <b>I</b>'ve got <b>to</b> grow up again! Let me see—how IS <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be managed? <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> eat <b>or</b> drink something <b>or</b> other; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> great question <b>is</b>, <b>what</b>?”
<br>The great question certainly <b>was</b>, <b>what</b>? <b>Alice</b> looked all round <b>her</b> at <b>the</b> flowers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> blades <b>of</b> grass, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> did not see anything that looked like <b>the</b> right thing <b>to</b> eat <b>or</b> drink under <b>the</b> circumstances. There <b>was</b> a large mushroom growing near <b>her</b>, about <b>the</b> same height as herself; <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> looked under <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>on</b> both sides <b>of</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> behind <b>it</b>, <b>it</b> occurred <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that <b>she</b> might as well look <b>and</b> see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>She stretched herself up <b>on</b> tiptoe, <b>and</b> <b>peeped</b> over <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes immediately met those <b>of</b> a large caterpillar, that <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, <b>and</b> taking not <b>the</b> smallest notice <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>or</b> <b>of</b> anything else.

<br><b>Chapter</b> V
<br>ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR
<br>
<br>The Caterpillar <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked at each other for some time <b>in</b> silence: at last <b>the</b> Caterpillar took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth, <b>and</b> addressed <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a languid, sleepy voice.
<br>“Who are YOU?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>This <b>was</b> not an encouraging opening for a <b>conversation</b>. <b>Alice</b> replied, rather shyly, “<b>I</b>—<b>I</b> hardly know, sir, just at present— at least <b>I</b> know who <b>I</b> WAS when <b>I</b> got up this morning, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> must have been changed several times since then.”
<br>“What <b>do</b> you mean <b>by</b> that?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”
<br>“<b>I</b> can't explain MYSELF, <b>I</b>'m afraid, sir” said <b>Alice</b>, “because <b>I</b>'m not myself, you see.”
<br>“<b>I</b> don't see,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“<b>I</b>'m afraid <b>I</b> can't put <b>it</b> more clearly,” <b>Alice</b> replied <b>very</b> politely, “for <b>I</b> can't understand <b>it</b> myself <b>to</b> begin with; <b>and</b> being so many different sizes <b>in</b> a day <b>is</b> <b>very</b> confusing.”
<br>“It isn't,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, perhaps you haven't found <b>it</b> so yet,” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>but</b> when you have <b>to</b> turn <b>into</b> a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—<b>and</b> then after that <b>into</b> a butterfly, <b>I</b> should think you'll feel <b>it</b> a little queer, won't you?”
<br>“Not a bit,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said <b>Alice</b>; “all <b>I</b> know <b>is</b>, <b>it</b> would feel <b>very</b> queer <b>to</b> ME.”
<br>“You!” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are YOU?”
<br>Which brought them back again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b>. <b>Alice</b> felt a little irritated at <b>the</b> Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> drew herself up <b>and</b> said, <b>very</b> gravely, “<b>I</b> think, you out <b>to</b> tell me who YOU are, first.”
<br>“Why?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>Here <b>was</b> another puzzling question; <b>and</b> as <b>Alice</b> could not think <b>of</b> any good reason, <b>and</b> as <b>the</b> Caterpillar seemed <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> a VERY unpleasant state <b>of</b> mind, <b>she</b> turned away.
<br>“Come back!” <b>the</b> Caterpillar called after <b>her</b>. “<b>I</b>'ve something important <b>to</b> say!”
<br>This sounded promising, certainly: <b>Alice</b> turned <b>and</b> came back again.
<br>“Keep your temper,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Is that all?” said <b>Alice</b>, swallowing down <b>her</b> anger as well as <b>she</b> could.
<br>“No,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might as well wait, as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b>, <b>and</b> perhaps after all <b>it</b> might tell <b>her</b> something worth hearing. For some minutes <b>it</b> puffed away <b>without</b> speaking, <b>but</b> at last <b>it</b> unfolded its arms, took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth again, <b>and</b> said, “So you think you're changed, <b>do</b> you?”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m afraid <b>I</b> am, sir,” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>I</b> can't remember things as <b>I</b> used—<b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't keep <b>the</b> same size for ten minutes together!”
<br>“Can't remember WHAT things?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b>'ve tried <b>to</b> say «HOW DOTH <b>THE</b> LITTLE BUSY BEE,» <b>but</b> <b>it</b> all came different!” <b>Alice</b> replied <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> melancholy voice.
<br>“Repeat, «YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"“ said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> folded <b>her</b> hands, <b>and</b> began:—
<br>“You are old, Father William,” <b>the</b> young man said,
<br>“And your hair has become <b>very</b> white; And yet you incessantly stand <b>on</b> your head—
<br>Do you think, at your age, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> right?”
<br>“In my youth,” Father William replied <b>to</b> his son,
<br>“<b>I</b> feared <b>it</b> might injure <b>the</b> brain; But, now that <b>I</b>'m perfectly sure <b>I</b> have none,
<br>Why, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again <b>and</b> again.”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “as <b>I</b> mentioned before,
<br>And have grown most uncommonly fat; Yet you turned a back-somersault <b>in</b> at <b>the</b> door—
<br>Pray, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason <b>of</b> that?”
<br>“In my youth,” said <b>the</b> sage, as he shook his grey locks,
<br>“<b>I</b> kept all my limbs <b>very</b> supple By <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> this ointment—one shilling <b>the</b> box—
<br>Allow me <b>to</b> sell you a couple?”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “<b>and</b> your jaws are too weak
<br>For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished <b>the</b> goose, with <b>the</b> bones <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beak—
<br>Pray how did you manage <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>“In my youth,” said his father, “<b>I</b> took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law,
<br>And argued each case with my wife; And <b>the</b> muscular strength, which <b>it</b> gave <b>to</b> my jaw,
<br>Has lasted <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> my life.”
<br>“You are old,” said <b>the</b> youth, “one would hardly suppose
<br>That your eye <b>was</b> as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> your nose—
<br>What made you so awfully clever?”
<br>“<b>I</b> have answered three questions, <b>and</b> that <b>is</b> enough,”
<br>Said his father; “don't give yourself airs! Do you think <b>I</b> can listen all day <b>to</b> such stuff?
<br>Be off, <b>or</b> <b>I</b>'ll kick you down stairs!”
<br>“That <b>is</b> not said right,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Not QUITE right, <b>I</b>'m afraid,” said <b>Alice</b>, timidly; some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words have got altered.”
<br>“It <b>is</b> wrong from <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> end,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar decidedly, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> silence for some minutes.
<br>The Caterpillar <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> speak.
<br>“What size <b>do</b> you want <b>to</b> be?” <b>it</b> asked.
<br>“Oh, <b>I</b>'m not particular as <b>to</b> size,” <b>Alice</b> hastily replied; “only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.”
<br>“<b>I</b> DON'T know,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br><b>Alice</b> said <b>nothing</b>: <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never been so much contradicted <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life before, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> felt that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> losing <b>her</b> temper.
<br>“Are you content now?” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,” said <b>Alice</b>: “three inches <b>is</b> such a wretched height <b>to</b> be.”
<br>“It <b>is</b> a <b>very</b> good height indeed!” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as <b>it</b> spoke (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> exactly three inches high).
<br>“But <b>I</b>'m not used <b>to</b> <b>it</b>!” pleaded poor <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a piteous tone. And <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> herself, “<b>I</b> wish <b>the</b> creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!”
<br>“You'll <b>get</b> used <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> time,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> put <b>the</b> hookah <b>into</b> its mouth <b>and</b> began smoking again.
<br>This time <b>Alice</b> waited patiently until <b>it</b> chose <b>to</b> speak again. In a minute <b>or</b> two <b>the</b> Caterpillar took <b>the</b> hookah out <b>of</b> its mouth <b>and</b> yawned <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b>, <b>and</b> shook itself. Then <b>it</b> got down off <b>the</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> crawled away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grass, merely remarking as <b>it</b> went, “One side will make you grow taller, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other side will make you grow shorter.”
<br>“One side <b>of</b> WHAT? The other side <b>of</b> WHAT?” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>to</b> herself.
<br>“Of <b>the</b> mushroom,” said <b>the</b> Caterpillar, just as if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> asked <b>it</b> aloud; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> another moment <b>it</b> <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> sight.
<br><b>Alice</b> remained looking thoughtfully at <b>the</b> mushroom for a minute, trying <b>to</b> make out which were <b>the</b> two sides <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; <b>and</b> as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> perfectly round, <b>she</b> found this a <b>very</b> difficult question. However, at last <b>she</b> stretched <b>her</b> arms round <b>it</b> as far as they would go, <b>and</b> broke off a bit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge with each hand.
<br>“And now which <b>is</b> which?” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> nibbled a little <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right-hand bit <b>to</b> try <b>the</b> effect: <b>the</b> next moment <b>she</b> felt a violent blow underneath <b>her</b> chin: <b>it</b> <b>had</b> struck <b>her</b> foot!
<br>She <b>was</b> a good deal frightened <b>by</b> this <b>very</b> sudden change, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> felt that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> be lost, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shrinking rapidly; so <b>she</b> set <b>to</b> work at <b>once</b> <b>to</b> eat some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other bit. Her chin <b>was</b> pressed so closely against <b>her</b> foot, that there <b>was</b> hardly room <b>to</b> open <b>her</b> mouth; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> did <b>it</b> at last, <b>and</b> managed <b>to</b> swallow a morsel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lefthand bit.
<br>“Come, my head's free at last!” said <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> delight, which changed <b>into</b> alarm <b>in</b> another moment, when <b>she</b> found that <b>her</b> shoulders were nowhere <b>to</b> be found: all <b>she</b> could see, when <b>she</b> looked down, <b>was</b> an immense length <b>of</b> neck, which seemed <b>to</b> rise like a stalk out <b>of</b> a sea <b>of</b> green leaves that lay far below <b>her</b>.
<br>“What CAN all that green stuff be?” said <b>Alice</b>. “And where HAVE my shoulders got <b>to</b>? And oh, my poor hands, how <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>I</b> can't see you?” She <b>was</b> moving them about as <b>she</b> spoke, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> result seemed <b>to</b> follow, except a little shaking among <b>the</b> distant green leaves.
<br>As there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> getting <b>her</b> hands up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> head, <b>she</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> head down <b>to</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> delighted <b>to</b> find that <b>her</b> neck would bend about easily <b>in</b> any direction, like a serpent. She <b>had</b> just succeeded <b>in</b> curving <b>it</b> down <b>into</b> a graceful zigzag, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> dive <b>in</b> among <b>the</b> leaves, which <b>she</b> found <b>to</b> be <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees under which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been wandering, when a sharp hiss made <b>her</b> draw back <b>in</b> a hurry: a large pigeon <b>had</b> flown <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> beating <b>her</b> violently with its wings.
<br>“Serpent!” screamed <b>the</b> Pigeon.
<br>“<b>I</b>'m NOT a serpent!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly. “Let me alone!”
<br>“Serpent, <b>I</b> say again!” repeated <b>the</b> Pigeon, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> a more subdued tone, <b>and</b> added with a kind <b>of</b> sob, “<b>I</b>'ve tried every way, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> seems <b>to</b> suit them!”
<br>“<b>I</b> haven't <b>the</b> least idea <b>what</b> you're talking about,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“<b>I</b>'ve tried <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> trees, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ve tried banks, <b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ve tried hedges,” <b>the</b> Pigeon went <b>on</b>, <b>without</b> attending <b>to</b> <b>her</b>; “<b>but</b> those serpents! There's <b>no</b> pleasing them!”
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> more <b>and</b> more puzzled, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> saying anything more till <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>had</b> finished.
<br>“As if <b>it</b> wasn't trouble enough hatching <b>the</b> eggs,” said <b>the</b> Pigeon; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> must be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> look-out for serpents night <b>and</b> day! Why, <b>I</b> haven't <b>had</b> a wink <b>of</b> sleep these three weeks!”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m <b>very</b> sorry you've been annoyed,” said <b>Alice</b>, who <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> see its meaning.
<br>“And just as <b>I</b>'d taken <b>the</b> highest tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood,” continued <b>the</b> Pigeon, raising its voice <b>to</b> a shriek, “<b>and</b> just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking <b>I</b> should be free <b>of</b> them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from <b>the</b> sky! Ugh, Serpent!”
<br>“But <b>I</b>'m NOT a serpent, <b>I</b> tell you!” said <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b>'m a—<b>I</b>'m a—”
<br>“Well! WHAT are you?” said <b>the</b> Pigeon. “<b>I</b> can see you're trying <b>to</b> invent something!”
<br>“<b>I</b>—<b>I</b>'m a little girl,” said <b>Alice</b>, rather doubtfully, as <b>she</b> remembered <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> changes <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone through that day.
<br>“A likely story indeed!” said <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deepest contempt. “<b>I</b>'ve seen a good many little girls <b>in</b> my time, <b>but</b> never ONE with such a neck as that! No, <b>no</b>! You're a serpent; <b>and</b> there's <b>no</b> <b>use</b> denying <b>it</b>. <b>I</b> suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!”
<br>“<b>I</b> HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b>, who <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> truthful child; “<b>but</b> little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents <b>do</b>, you know.”
<br>“<b>I</b> don't believe <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Pigeon; “<b>but</b> if they <b>do</b>, why then they're a kind <b>of</b> serpent, that's all <b>I</b> can say.”
<br>This <b>was</b> such a new idea <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite silent for a minute <b>or</b> two, which gave <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>the</b> opportunity <b>of</b> adding, “You're looking for eggs, <b>I</b> know THAT well enough; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> does <b>it</b> matter <b>to</b> me whether you're a little girl <b>or</b> a serpent?”
<br>“It matters a good deal <b>to</b> ME,” said <b>Alice</b> hastily; “<b>but</b> <b>I</b>'m not looking for eggs, as <b>it</b> happens; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>was</b>, <b>I</b> shouldn't want YOURS: <b>I</b> don't like them raw.”
<br>“Well, be off, then!” said <b>the</b> Pigeon <b>in</b> a sulky tone, as <b>it</b> settled down again <b>into</b> its nest. <b>Alice</b> crouched down among <b>the</b> trees as well as <b>she</b> could, for <b>her</b> neck kept getting entangled among <b>the</b> branches, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>and</b> untwist <b>it</b>. After a while <b>she</b> remembered that <b>she</b> still held <b>the</b> pieces <b>of</b> mushroom <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> set <b>to</b> work <b>very</b> carefully, nibbling first at one <b>and</b> then at <b>the</b> other, <b>and</b> growing sometimes taller <b>and</b> sometimes shorter, until <b>she</b> <b>had</b> succeeded <b>in</b> bringing herself down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> usual height.
<br>It <b>was</b> so long since <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been anything near <b>the</b> right size, that <b>it</b> felt quite strange at first; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> got used <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a few minutes, <b>and</b> began talking <b>to</b> herself, as usual. “Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! <b>I</b>'m never sure <b>what</b> <b>I</b>'m going <b>to</b> be, from one minute <b>to</b> another! However, <b>I</b>'ve got back <b>to</b> my right size: <b>the</b> next thing <b>is</b>, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> that beautiful garden—how IS that <b>to</b> be done, <b>I</b> wonder?” As <b>she</b> said this, <b>she</b> came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house <b>in</b> <b>it</b> about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b>'ll never <b>do</b> <b>to</b> come upon them THIS size: why, <b>I</b> should frighten them out <b>of</b> their wits!” So <b>she</b> began nibbling at <b>the</b> righthand bit again, <b>and</b> did not venture <b>to</b> go near <b>the</b> house till <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought herself down <b>to</b> nine inches high.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> VI
<br>PIG AND PEPPER
<br>
<br>For a minute <b>or</b> two <b>she</b> stood looking at <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> wondering <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next, when suddenly a footman <b>in</b> livery came running out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood—(<b>she</b> considered him <b>to</b> be a footman because he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> livery: otherwise, judging <b>by</b> his face only, <b>she</b> would have called him a fish)—<b>and</b> rapped loudly at <b>the</b> door with his knuckles. It <b>was</b> opened <b>by</b> another footman <b>in</b> livery, with a round face, <b>and</b> large eyes like a frog; <b>and</b> both footmen, <b>Alice</b> noticed, <b>had</b> powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt <b>very</b> curious <b>to</b> know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all about, <b>and</b> crept a little way out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wood <b>to</b> listen.
<br>The Fish-Footman began <b>by</b> producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, <b>and</b> this he handed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, saying, <b>in</b> a solemn tone, “For <b>the</b> Duchess. An invitation from <b>the</b> Queen <b>to</b> play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same solemn tone, only changing <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words a little, “From <b>the</b> Queen. An invitation for <b>the</b> Duchess <b>to</b> play croquet.”
<br>Then they both bowed low, <b>and</b> their curls got entangled together.
<br><b>Alice</b> laughed so much at this, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> run back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood for fear <b>of</b> their hearing <b>her</b>; <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> next <b>peeped</b> out <b>the</b> Fish-Footman <b>was</b> gone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground near <b>the</b> door, staring stupidly up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky.
<br><b>Alice</b> went timidly up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>and</b> knocked.
<br>“There's <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> knocking,” said <b>the</b> Footman, “<b>and</b> that for two reasons. First, because <b>I</b>'m <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, <b>no</b> one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there <b>was</b> a most extraordinary noise going <b>on</b> within—a constant howling <b>and</b> sneezing, <b>and</b> every now <b>and</b> then a great crash, as if a dish <b>or</b> kettle <b>had</b> been broken <b>to</b> pieces.
<br>“Please, then,” said <b>Alice</b>, “how am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b>?”
<br>“There might be some sense <b>in</b> your knocking,” <b>the</b> Footman went <b>on</b> <b>without</b> attending <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, “if we <b>had</b> <b>the</b> door between us. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could let you out, you know.” He <b>was</b> looking up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky all <b>the</b> time he <b>was</b> speaking, <b>and</b> this <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can't help <b>it</b>,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself; “his eyes are so VERY nearly at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b>?” <b>she</b> repeated, aloud.
<br>“<b>I</b> shall sit here,” <b>the</b> Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”
<br>At this moment <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house opened, <b>and</b> a large plate came skimming out, straight at <b>the</b> Footman's head: <b>it</b> just grazed his nose, <b>and</b> broke <b>to</b> pieces against one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees behind him.
<br>“—<b>or</b> next day, maybe,” <b>the</b> Footman continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same tone, exactly as if <b>nothing</b> <b>had</b> happened.
<br>“How am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b>?” asked <b>Alice</b> again, <b>in</b> a louder tone.
<br>“ARE you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> at all?” said <b>the</b> Footman. “That's <b>the</b> first question, you know.”
<br>It <b>was</b>, <b>no</b> doubt: only <b>Alice</b> did not like <b>to</b> be told so. “It's really dreadful,” <b>she</b> muttered <b>to</b> herself, “<b>the</b> way all <b>the</b> creatures argue. It's enough <b>to</b> drive one crazy!”
<br>The Footman seemed <b>to</b> think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “<b>I</b> shall sit here,” he said, “<b>on</b> <b>and</b> off, for days <b>and</b> days.”
<br>“But <b>what</b> am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b>?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Anything you like” said <b>the</b> Footman, <b>and</b> began whistling.
<br>“Oh, there's <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> talking <b>to</b> him,” said <b>Alice</b> desperately: “he's perfectly idiotic!” And <b>she</b> opened <b>the</b> door <b>and</b> went <b>in</b>.
<br>The door led right <b>into</b> a large kitchen, which <b>was</b> full <b>of</b> smoke from one end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other: <b>the</b> Duchess <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a three-legged stool <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle, nursing a baby; <b>the</b> cook <b>was</b> leaning over <b>the</b> fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed <b>to</b> be full <b>of</b> soup.
<br>“There's certainly too much pepper <b>in</b> that soup!” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> herself, as well as <b>she</b> could for sneezing.
<br>There <b>was</b> certainly too much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Even <b>the</b> Duchess sneezed occasionally; <b>and</b> as for <b>the</b> baby, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sneezing <b>and</b> howling alternately <b>without</b> a moment's pause. The only things <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen that did not sneeze, were <b>the</b> cook, <b>and</b> a large cat which <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hearth <b>and</b> grinning from ear <b>to</b> ear.
<br>“Please would you tell me,” said <b>Alice</b>, a little timidly, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not quite sure whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good manners for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”
<br>“It's a Cheshire cat,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “<b>and</b> that's why. Pig!”
<br>She said <b>the</b> last word with such sudden violence that <b>Alice</b> quite jumped; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> saw <b>in</b> another moment that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> addressed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> baby, <b>and</b> not <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, so <b>she</b> took courage, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> again:—
<br><b>I</b> didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; <b>in</b> fact, <b>I</b> didn't know that cats COULD grin.”
<br>“They all can,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> most <b>of</b> 'em <b>do</b>.”
<br>“<b>I</b> don't know <b>of</b> any that <b>do</b>,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>very</b> politely, feeling quite pleased <b>to</b> have got <b>into</b> a <b>conversation</b>.
<br>“You don't know much,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> that's a fact.”
<br><b>Alice</b> did not at all like <b>the</b> tone <b>of</b> this remark, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be as well <b>to</b> introduce some other subject <b>of</b> <b>conversation</b>. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> fix <b>on</b> one, <b>the</b> cook took <b>the</b> cauldron <b>of</b> soup off <b>the</b> fire, <b>and</b> at <b>once</b> set <b>to</b> work throwing everything within <b>her</b> reach at <b>the</b> Duchess <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby- -<b>the</b> fire-irons came first; then followed a shower <b>of</b> saucepans, plates, <b>and</b> dishes. The Duchess took <b>no</b> notice <b>of</b> them even when they hit <b>her</b>; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby <b>was</b> howling so much already, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> quite impossible <b>to</b> say whether <b>the</b> blows hurt <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not.
<br>“Oh, PLEASE mind <b>what</b> you're doing!” cried <b>Alice</b>, jumping up <b>and</b> down <b>in</b> an agony <b>of</b> terror. “Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close <b>by</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> nearly carried <b>it</b> off.
<br>“If everybody minded their own business,” <b>the</b> Duchess said <b>in</b> a hoarse growl, “<b>the</b> world would go round a deal faster than <b>it</b> does.”
<br>“Which would NOT be an advantage,” said <b>Alice</b>, who felt <b>very</b> glad <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an opportunity <b>of</b> showing off a little <b>of</b> <b>her</b> knowledge. “Just think <b>of</b> <b>what</b> work <b>it</b> would make with <b>the</b> day <b>and</b> night! You see <b>the</b> earth takes twenty-four hours <b>to</b> turn round <b>on</b> its axis—”
<br>“Talking <b>of</b> axes,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “chop off <b>her</b> head!”
<br><b>Alice</b> glanced rather anxiously at <b>the</b> cook, <b>to</b> see if <b>she</b> meant <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> hint; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> cook <b>was</b> busily stirring <b>the</b> soup, <b>and</b> seemed not <b>to</b> be listening, so <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> again: “Twenty-four hours, <b>I</b> THINK; <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> twelve? <b>I</b>—”
<br>“Oh, don't bother ME,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>I</b> never could abide figures!” And with that <b>she</b> began nursing <b>her</b> child again, singing a sort <b>of</b> lullaby <b>to</b> <b>it</b> as <b>she</b> did so, <b>and</b> giving <b>it</b> a violent shake at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> every line:
<br>
<br>“Speak roughly <b>to</b> your little boy,
<br>And beat him when he sneezes:
<br>He only does <b>it</b> <b>to</b> annoy,
<br>Because he knows <b>it</b> teases.”
<br>
<br>CHORUS.
<br>(In which <b>the</b> cook <b>and</b> <b>the</b> baby joined):—
<br>“Wow! wow! wow!”
<br>
<br>While <b>the</b> Duchess sang <b>the</b> second verse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, <b>she</b> kept tossing <b>the</b> baby violently up <b>and</b> down, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor little thing howled so, that <b>Alice</b> could hardly hear <b>the</b> words:—
<br>
<br>“<b>I</b> speak severely <b>to</b> my boy,
<br><b>I</b> beat him when he sneezes;
<br>For he can thoroughly enjoy
<br>The pepper when he pleases!”
<br>
<br>CHORUS.
<br>“Wow! wow! wow!”
<br>
<br>“Here! you may nurse <b>it</b> a bit, if you like!” <b>the</b> Duchess said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, flinging <b>the</b> baby at <b>her</b> as <b>she</b> spoke. “<b>I</b> must go <b>and</b> <b>get</b> ready <b>to</b> play croquet with <b>the</b> Queen,” <b>and</b> <b>she</b> hurried out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. The cook threw a frying-pan after <b>her</b> as <b>she</b> went out, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> just missed <b>her</b>.
<br><b>Alice</b> caught <b>the</b> baby with some difficulty, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a queer- shaped little creature, <b>and</b> held out its arms <b>and</b> legs <b>in</b> all directions, “just like a star-fish,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. The poor little thing <b>was</b> snorting like a steam-engine when <b>she</b> caught <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> kept doubling itself up <b>and</b> straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for <b>the</b> first minute <b>or</b> two, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> as much as <b>she</b> could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> hold <b>it</b>.
<br>As soon as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made out <b>the</b> proper way <b>of</b> nursing <b>it</b>, (which <b>was</b> <b>to</b> twist <b>it</b> up <b>into</b> a sort <b>of</b> knot, <b>and</b> then keep tight hold <b>of</b> its right ear <b>and</b> left foot, so as <b>to</b> prevent its undoing itself,) <b>she</b> carried <b>it</b> out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open air. “IF <b>I</b> don't take this child away with me,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “they're sure <b>to</b> kill <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a day <b>or</b> two: wouldn't <b>it</b> be murder <b>to</b> leave <b>it</b> behind?” She said <b>the</b> last words out loud, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little thing grunted <b>in</b> reply (<b>it</b> <b>had</b> left off sneezing <b>by</b> this time). “Don't grunt,” said <b>Alice</b>; “that's not at all a proper way <b>of</b> expressing yourself.”
<br>The baby grunted again, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked <b>very</b> anxiously <b>into</b> its face <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> matter with <b>it</b>. There could be <b>no</b> doubt that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether <b>Alice</b> did not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thing at all. “But perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only sobbing,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>, <b>and</b> looked <b>into</b> its eyes again, <b>to</b> see if there were any tears.
<br>No, there were <b>no</b> tears. “If you're going <b>to</b> turn <b>into</b> a pig, my dear,” said <b>Alice</b>, seriously, “<b>I</b>'ll have <b>nothing</b> more <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (<b>or</b> grunted, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible <b>to</b> say which), <b>and</b> they went <b>on</b> for some while <b>in</b> silence.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> just <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> think <b>to</b> herself, “Now, <b>what</b> am <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this creature when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> home?” when <b>it</b> grunted again, so violently, that <b>she</b> looked down <b>into</b> its face <b>in</b> some alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about <b>it</b>: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> neither more nor less than a pig, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> felt that <b>it</b> would be quite absurd for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>it</b> further.
<br>So <b>she</b> set <b>the</b> little creature down, <b>and</b> felt quite relieved <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> trot away quietly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wood. “If <b>it</b> <b>had</b> grown up,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, “<b>it</b> would have made a dreadfully ugly child: <b>but</b> <b>it</b> makes rather a handsome pig, <b>I</b> think.” And <b>she</b> began thinking over other children <b>she</b> knew, who might <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well as pigs, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> just saying <b>to</b> herself, “if one only knew <b>the</b> right way <b>to</b> change them—” when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a little startled <b>by</b> seeing <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a bough <b>of</b> a tree a few yards off.
<br>The Cat only grinned when <b>it</b> saw <b>Alice</b>. It looked good- natured, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>: still <b>it</b> <b>had</b> VERY long claws <b>and</b> a great many teeth, so <b>she</b> felt that <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be treated with respect.
<br>“Cheshire Puss,” <b>she</b> began, rather timidly, as <b>she</b> did not at all know whether <b>it</b> would like <b>the</b> name: however, <b>it</b> only grinned a little wider. “Come, <b>it</b>'s pleased so far,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>. “Would you tell me, please, which way <b>I</b> ought <b>to</b> go from here?”
<br>“That depends a good deal <b>on</b> where you want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b>,” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“<b>I</b> don't much care where—” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> doesn't matter which way you go,” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“—so long as <b>I</b> <b>get</b> SOMEWHERE,” <b>Alice</b> added as an explanation.
<br>“Oh, you're sure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”
<br><b>Alice</b> felt that this could not be denied, so <b>she</b> tried another question. “What sort <b>of</b> people live about here?”
<br>“In THAT direction,” <b>the</b> Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: <b>and</b> <b>in</b> THAT direction,” waving <b>the</b> other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.”
<br>“But <b>I</b> don't want <b>to</b> go among mad people,” <b>Alice</b> remarked.
<br>“Oh, you can't help that,” said <b>the</b> Cat: “we're all mad here. <b>I</b>'m mad. You're mad.”
<br>“How <b>do</b> you know <b>I</b>'m mad?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You must be,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “<b>or</b> you wouldn't have come here.”
<br><b>Alice</b> didn't think that proved <b>it</b> at all; however, <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> “And how <b>do</b> you know that you're mad?”
<br>“To begin with,” said <b>the</b> Cat, “a dog's not mad. You grant that?”
<br>“<b>I</b> suppose so,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Well, then,” <b>the</b> Cat went <b>on</b>, “you see, a dog growls when <b>it</b>'s angry, <b>and</b> wags its tail when <b>it</b>'s pleased. Now <b>I</b> growl when <b>I</b>'m pleased, <b>and</b> wag my tail when <b>I</b>'m angry. Therefore <b>I</b>'m mad.”
<br>“<b>I</b> call <b>it</b> purring, not growling,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Call <b>it</b> <b>what</b> you like,” said <b>the</b> Cat. “Do you play croquet with <b>the</b> Queen <b>to</b>-day?”
<br>“<b>I</b> should like <b>it</b> <b>very</b> much,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> haven't been invited yet.”
<br>“You'll see me there,” said <b>the</b> Cat, <b>and</b> vanished.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> not much surprised at this, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> getting so used <b>to</b> queer things happening. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> looking at <b>the</b> place where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been, <b>it</b> suddenly appeared again.
<br>“By-<b>the</b>-bye, <b>what</b> became <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby?” said <b>the</b> Cat. “<b>I</b>'d nearly forgotten <b>to</b> ask.”
<br>“It turned <b>into</b> a pig,” <b>Alice</b> quietly said, just as if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> come back <b>in</b> a natural way.
<br>“<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would,” said <b>the</b> Cat, <b>and</b> vanished again.
<br><b>Alice</b> waited a little, half expecting <b>to</b> see <b>it</b> again, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> did not appear, <b>and</b> after a minute <b>or</b> two <b>she</b> walked <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> March Hare <b>was</b> said <b>to</b> live. “<b>I</b>'ve seen hatters before,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself; “<b>the</b> March Hare will be much <b>the</b> most interesting, <b>and</b> perhaps as this <b>is</b> May <b>it</b> won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> March.” As <b>she</b> said this, <b>she</b> looked up, <b>and</b> there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Cat again, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a branch <b>of</b> a tree.
<br>“Did you say pig, <b>or</b> fig?” said <b>the</b> Cat.
<br>“<b>I</b> said pig,” replied <b>Alice</b>; “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish you wouldn't keep appearing <b>and</b> vanishing so suddenly: you make <b>on</b> quite giddy.”
<br>“All right,” said <b>the</b> Cat; <b>and</b> this time <b>it</b> vanished quite slowly, <b>beginning</b> with <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail, <b>and</b> ending with <b>the</b> grin, which remained some time after <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> gone.
<br>“Well! <b>I</b>'ve often seen a cat <b>without</b> a grin,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>; “<b>but</b> a grin <b>without</b> a cat! It's <b>the</b> most curious thing <b>I</b> ever say <b>in</b> my life!”
<br>She <b>had</b> not gone much farther before <b>she</b> came <b>in</b> sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> March Hare: <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> must be <b>the</b> right house, because <b>the</b> chimneys were shaped like ears <b>and</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>was</b> thatched with fur. It <b>was</b> so large a house, that <b>she</b> did not like <b>to</b> go nearer till <b>she</b> <b>had</b> nibbled some more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lefthand bit <b>of</b> mushroom, <b>and</b> raised herself <b>to</b> about two feet high: even then <b>she</b> walked up towards <b>it</b> rather timidly, saying <b>to</b> herself “Suppose <b>it</b> should be raving mad after all! <b>I</b> almost wish <b>I</b>'d gone <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Hatter instead!”
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> VII
<br>A MAD TEA-PARTY
<br>
<br>There <b>was</b> a table set out under a tree <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> March Hare <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hatter were <b>having</b> tea at <b>it</b>: a Dormouse <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> between them, fast asleep, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other two were using <b>it</b> as a cushion, resting their elbows <b>on</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for <b>the</b> Dormouse,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>; “only, as <b>it</b>'s asleep, <b>I</b> suppose <b>it</b> doesn't mind.”
<br>The table <b>was</b> a large one, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> three were all crowded together at one corner <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw <b>Alice</b> coming. “There's PLENTY <b>of</b> room!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> sat down <b>in</b> a large arm-chair at one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table.
<br>“Have some wine,” <b>the</b> March Hare said <b>in</b> an encouraging tone.
<br><b>Alice</b> looked all round <b>the</b> table, <b>but</b> there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>but</b> tea. “<b>I</b> don't see any wine,” <b>she</b> remarked.
<br>“There isn't any,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> wasn't <b>very</b> civil <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> offer <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b> angrily.
<br>“It wasn't <b>very</b> civil <b>of</b> you <b>to</b> sit down <b>without</b> being invited,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“<b>I</b> didn't know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> YOUR table,” said <b>Alice</b>; “<b>it</b>'s laid for a great many more than three.”
<br>“Your hair wants cutting,” said <b>the</b> Hatter. He <b>had</b> been looking at <b>Alice</b> for some time with great curiosity, <b>and</b> this <b>was</b> his first speech.
<br>“You should learn not <b>to</b> make personal remarks,” <b>Alice</b> said with some severity; “<b>it</b>'s <b>very</b> rude.”
<br>The Hatter opened his eyes <b>very</b> wide <b>on</b> hearing this; <b>but</b> all he SAID <b>was</b>, “Why <b>is</b> a raven like a writing-desk?”
<br>“Come, we shall have some fun now!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b>'m glad they've begun asking riddles.—<b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> can guess that,” <b>she</b> added aloud.
<br>“Do you mean that you think you can find out <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Exactly so,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Then you should say <b>what</b> you mean,” <b>the</b> March Hare went <b>on</b>.
<br>“<b>I</b> <b>do</b>,” <b>Alice</b> hastily replied; “at least—at least <b>I</b> mean <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say—that's <b>the</b> same thing, you know.”
<br>“Not <b>the</b> same thing a bit!” said <b>the</b> Hatter. “You might just as well say that «<b>I</b> see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> eat» <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same thing as «<b>I</b> eat <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see»!”
<br>“You might just as well say,” added <b>the</b> March Hare, “that «<b>I</b> like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b>» <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same thing as «<b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like»!”
<br>“You might just as well say,” added <b>the</b> Dormouse, who seemed <b>to</b> be talking <b>in</b> his sleep, “that «<b>I</b> breathe when <b>I</b> sleep» <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same thing as «<b>I</b> sleep when <b>I</b> breathe»!”
<br>“It IS <b>the</b> same thing with you,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b> here <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> dropped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> party sat silent for a minute, while <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> over all <b>she</b> could remember about ravens <b>and</b> writing-desks, which wasn't much.
<br>The Hatter <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> silence. “What day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?” he said, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>: he <b>had</b> taken his watch out <b>of</b> his pocket, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> looking at <b>it</b> uneasily, shaking <b>it</b> every now <b>and</b> then, <b>and</b> holding <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his ear.
<br><b>Alice</b> considered a little, <b>and</b> then said “The fourth.”
<br>“Two days wrong!” sighed <b>the</b> Hatter. “<b>I</b> told you butter wouldn't suit <b>the</b> works!” he added looking angrily at <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> BEST butter,” <b>the</b> March Hare meekly replied.
<br>“Yes, <b>but</b> some crumbs must have got <b>in</b> as well,” <b>the</b> Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn't have put <b>it</b> <b>in</b> with <b>the</b> bread-knife.”
<br>The March Hare took <b>the</b> watch <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> gloomily: then he dipped <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his cup <b>of</b> tea, <b>and</b> looked at <b>it</b> again: <b>but</b> he could think <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> better <b>to</b> say than his first remark, “It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> BEST butter, you know.”
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a funny watch!” <b>she</b> remarked. “It tells <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month, <b>and</b> doesn't tell <b>what</b> o'clock <b>it</b> <b>is</b>!”
<br>“Why should <b>it</b>?” muttered <b>the</b> Hatter. “Does YOUR watch tell you <b>what</b> year <b>it</b> <b>is</b>?”
<br>“Of course not,” <b>Alice</b> replied <b>very</b> readily: “<b>but</b> that's because <b>it</b> stays <b>the</b> same year for such a long time together.”
<br>“Which <b>is</b> just <b>the</b> case with MINE,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br><b>Alice</b> felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed <b>to</b> have <b>no</b> sort <b>of</b> meaning <b>in</b> <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> certainly English. “<b>I</b> don't quite understand you,” <b>she</b> said, as politely as <b>she</b> could.
<br>“The Dormouse <b>is</b> asleep again,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b> he poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
<br>The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, <b>and</b> said, <b>without</b> opening its eyes, “Of course, <b>of</b> course; just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> remark myself.”
<br>“Have you guessed <b>the</b> riddle yet?” <b>the</b> Hatter said, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> again.
<br>“No, <b>I</b> give <b>it</b> up,” <b>Alice</b> replied: “that's <b>the</b> answer?”
<br>“<b>I</b> haven't <b>the</b> slightest idea,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“Nor <b>I</b>,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br><b>Alice</b> sighed wearily. “<b>I</b> think you might <b>do</b> something better with <b>the</b> time,” <b>she</b> said, “than waste <b>it</b> <b>in</b> asking riddles that have <b>no</b> answers.”
<br>“If you knew Time as well as <b>I</b> <b>do</b>,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, “you wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.”
<br>“<b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> you mean,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Of course you don't!” <b>the</b> Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. “<b>I</b> dare say you never even spoke <b>to</b> Time!”
<br>“Perhaps not,” <b>Alice</b> cautiously replied: “<b>but</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> have <b>to</b> beat time when <b>I</b> learn music.”
<br>“Ah! that accounts for <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Hatter. “He won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept <b>on</b> good terms with him, he'd <b>do</b> almost anything you liked with <b>the</b> clock. For instance, suppose <b>it</b> were nine o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, just time <b>to</b> begin lessons: you'd only have <b>to</b> whisper a hint <b>to</b> Time, <b>and</b> round goes <b>the</b> clock <b>in</b> a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!”
<br>(`<b>I</b> only wish <b>it</b> <b>was</b>,” <b>the</b> March Hare said <b>to</b> itself <b>in</b> a whisper.)
<br>“That would be grand, certainly,” said <b>Alice</b> thoughtfully: “<b>but</b> then—<b>I</b> shouldn't be hungry for <b>it</b>, you know.”
<br>“Not at first, perhaps,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “<b>but</b> you could keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> half-past one as long as you liked.”
<br>“Is that <b>the</b> way YOU manage?” <b>Alice</b> asked.
<br>The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not <b>I</b>!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March—just before HE went mad, you know—” (pointing with his tea spoon at <b>the</b> March Hare,) “—<b>it</b> <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> great concert given <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Queen <b>of</b> Hearts, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sing
<br>
<br>«Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
<br>How <b>I</b> wonder <b>what</b> you're at!»
<br>
<br>You know <b>the</b> song, perhaps?”
<br>“<b>I</b>'ve heard something like <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“It goes <b>on</b>, you know,” <b>the</b> Hatter continued, “<b>in</b> this way:—
<br>
<br>«Up above <b>the</b> world you fly,
<br>Like a tea-tray <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky.
<br>Twinkle, twinkle—"“
<br>
<br>Here <b>the</b> Dormouse shook itself, <b>and</b> began singing <b>in</b> its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> so long that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pinch <b>it</b> <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> stop.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b>'d hardly finished <b>the</b> first verse,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, “when <b>the</b> Queen jumped up <b>and</b> bawled out, «He's murdering <b>the</b> time! Off with his head!"“
<br>“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“And ever since that,” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a mournful tone, “he won't <b>do</b> a thing <b>I</b> ask! It's always six o'clock now.”
<br>A bright idea came <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s head. “Is that <b>the</b> reason so many tea-things are put out here?” <b>she</b> asked.
<br>“Yes, that's <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Hatter with a sigh: “<b>it</b>'s always tea-time, <b>and</b> we've <b>no</b> time <b>to</b> wash <b>the</b> things between whiles.”
<br>“Then you keep moving round, <b>I</b> suppose?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Exactly so,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “as <b>the</b> things <b>get</b> used up.”
<br>“But <b>what</b> happens when you come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> again?” <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> ask.
<br>“Suppose we change <b>the</b> subject,” <b>the</b> March Hare interrupted, yawning. “<b>I</b>'m getting <b>tired</b> <b>of</b> this. <b>I</b> vote <b>the</b> young lady tells us a story.”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m afraid <b>I</b> don't know one,” said <b>Alice</b>, rather alarmed at <b>the</b> proposal.
<br>“Then <b>the</b> Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And they pinched <b>it</b> <b>on</b> both sides at <b>once</b>.
<br>The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “<b>I</b> wasn't asleep,” he said <b>in</b> a hoarse, feeble voice: “<b>I</b> heard every word you fellows were saying.”
<br>“Tell us a story!” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Yes, please <b>do</b>!” pleaded <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“And be quick about <b>it</b>,” added <b>the</b> Hatter, “<b>or</b> you'll be asleep again before <b>it</b>'s done.”
<br>“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” <b>the</b> Dormouse began <b>in</b> a great hurry; “<b>and</b> their names were Elsie, Lacie, <b>and</b> Tillie; <b>and</b> they lived at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well—”
<br>“What did they live <b>on</b>?” said <b>Alice</b>, who always took a great interest <b>in</b> questions <b>of</b> eating <b>and</b> drinking.
<br>“They lived <b>on</b> treacle,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, after thinking a minute <b>or</b> two.
<br>“They couldn't have done that, you know,” <b>Alice</b> gently remarked; “they'd have been ill.”
<br>“So they were,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse; “VERY ill.”
<br><b>Alice</b> tried <b>to</b> fancy <b>to</b> herself <b>what</b> such an extraordinary ways <b>of</b> living would be like, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> puzzled <b>her</b> too much, so <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>: “But why did they live at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well?”
<br>“Take some more tea,” <b>the</b> March Hare said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>very</b> earnestly.
<br>“<b>I</b>'ve <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> yet,” <b>Alice</b> replied <b>in</b> an offended tone, “so <b>I</b> can't take more.”
<br>“You mean you can't take LESS,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “<b>it</b>'s <b>very</b> easy <b>to</b> take MORE than <b>nothing</b>.”
<br>“Nobody asked YOUR opinion,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Who's making personal remarks now?” <b>the</b> Hatter asked triumphantly.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not quite know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> this: so <b>she</b> helped herself <b>to</b> some tea <b>and</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter, <b>and</b> then turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse, <b>and</b> repeated <b>her</b> question. “Why did they live at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> a well?”
<br>The Dormouse again took a minute <b>or</b> two <b>to</b> think about <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> then said, “It <b>was</b> a treacle-well.”
<br>“There's <b>no</b> such thing!” <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>very</b> angrily, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hatter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> March Hare went “Sh! sh!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse sulkily remarked, “If you can't be civil, you'd better finish <b>the</b> story for yourself.”
<br>“No, please go <b>on</b>!” <b>Alice</b> said <b>very</b> humbly; “<b>I</b> won't interrupt again. <b>I</b> dare say there may be ONE.”
<br>“One, indeed!” said <b>the</b> Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented <b>to</b> go <b>on</b>. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning <b>to</b> draw, you know—”
<br>“What did they draw?” said <b>Alice</b>, quite forgetting <b>her</b> promise.
<br>“Treacle,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, <b>without</b> considering at all this time.
<br>“<b>I</b> want a clean cup,” interrupted <b>the</b> Hatter: “let's all move one place <b>on</b>.”
<br>He moved <b>on</b> as he spoke, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse followed him: <b>the</b> March Hare moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse's place, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> rather unwillingly took <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> March Hare. The Hatter <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only one who got any advantage from <b>the</b> change: <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> a good deal worse off than before, as <b>the</b> March Hare <b>had</b> just upset <b>the</b> milk-jug <b>into</b> his plate.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not wish <b>to</b> offend <b>the</b> Dormouse again, so <b>she</b> began <b>very</b> cautiously: “But <b>I</b> don't understand. Where did they draw <b>the</b> treacle from?”
<br>“You can draw water out <b>of</b> a water-well,” said <b>the</b> Hatter; “so <b>I</b> should think you could draw treacle out <b>of</b> a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”
<br>“But they were IN <b>the</b> well,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse, not choosing <b>to</b> notice this last remark.
<br>“Of course they were', said <b>the</b> Dormouse; “—well <b>in</b>.”
<br>This answer so confused poor <b>Alice</b>, that <b>she</b> let <b>the</b> Dormouse go <b>on</b> for some time <b>without</b> interrupting <b>it</b>.
<br>“They were learning <b>to</b> draw,” <b>the</b> Dormouse went <b>on</b>, yawning <b>and</b> rubbing its eyes, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> getting <b>very</b> sleepy; “<b>and</b> they drew all manner <b>of</b> things—everything that begins with an M—”
<br>“Why with an M?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why not?” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> silent.
<br>The Dormouse <b>had</b> closed its eyes <b>by</b> this time, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going off <b>into</b> a doze; <b>but</b>, <b>on</b> being pinched <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>it</b> woke up again with a little shriek, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b>: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moon, <b>and</b> memory, <b>and</b> muchness— you know you say things are «much <b>of</b> a muchness"—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing <b>of</b> a muchness?”
<br>“Really, now you ask me,” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>very</b> much confused, “<b>I</b> don't think—”
<br>“Then you shouldn't talk,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>This piece <b>of</b> rudeness <b>was</b> more than <b>Alice</b> could bear: <b>she</b> got up <b>in</b> great disgust, <b>and</b> walked off; <b>the</b> Dormouse fell asleep instantly, <b>and</b> neither <b>of</b> <b>the</b> others took <b>the</b> least notice <b>of</b> <b>her</b> going, though <b>she</b> looked back <b>once</b> <b>or</b> <b>twice</b>, half hoping that they would call after <b>her</b>: <b>the</b> last time <b>she</b> saw them, they were trying <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> Dormouse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> teapot.
<br>“At any rate <b>I</b>'ll never go THERE again!” said <b>Alice</b> as <b>she</b> picked <b>her</b> way through <b>the</b> wood. “It's <b>the</b> stupidest tea-party <b>I</b> ever <b>was</b> at <b>in</b> all my life!”
<br>Just as <b>she</b> said this, <b>she</b> noticed that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees <b>had</b> a door leading right <b>into</b> <b>it</b>. “That's <b>very</b> curious!” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>. “But everything's curious today. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> may as well go <b>in</b> at <b>once</b>.” And <b>in</b> <b>she</b> went.
<br>Once more <b>she</b> found herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> long hall, <b>and</b> close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> little glass table. “Now, <b>I</b>'ll manage better this time,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, <b>and</b> began <b>by</b> taking <b>the</b> little golden key, <b>and</b> unlocking <b>the</b> door that led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden. Then <b>she</b> wet <b>to</b> work nibbling at <b>the</b> mushroom (<b>she</b> <b>had</b> kept a piece <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocked) till <b>she</b> <b>was</b> about a foot high: then <b>she</b> walked down <b>the</b> little passage: <b>and</b> THEN—<b>she</b> found herself at last <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beautiful garden, among <b>the</b> bright flower-beds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cool fountains.
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> VIII
<br><b>THE</b> QUEEN'S CROQUET-GROUND
<br>
<br>A large rose-tree stood near <b>the</b> entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden: <b>the</b> roses growing <b>on</b> <b>it</b> were white, <b>but</b> there were three gardeners at <b>it</b>, busily painting them red. <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> this a <b>very</b> curious thing, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> went nearer <b>to</b> watch them, <b>and</b> just as <b>she</b> came up <b>to</b> them <b>she</b> heard one <b>of</b> them say, “Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!”
<br>“<b>I</b> couldn't help <b>it</b>,” said Five, <b>in</b> a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”
<br>On which Seven looked up <b>and</b> said, “That's right, Five! Always lay <b>the</b> blame <b>on</b> others!”
<br>“YOU'D better not talk!'said Five. “<b>I</b> heard <b>the</b> Queen say only yesterday you deserved <b>to</b> be beheaded!”
<br>“What for?” said <b>the</b> one who <b>had</b> spoken first.
<br>“That's none <b>of</b> YOUR business, Two!” said Seven.
<br>“Yes, <b>it</b> IS his business!” said Five, “<b>and</b> <b>I</b>'ll tell him—<b>it</b> <b>was</b> for bringing <b>the</b> cook tulip-roots instead <b>of</b> onions.”
<br>Seven flung down his brush, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> just begun “Well, <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> unjust things—” when his eye chanced <b>to</b> fall upon <b>Alice</b>, as <b>she</b> stood watching them, <b>and</b> he checked himself suddenly: <b>the</b> others looked round also, <b>and</b> all <b>of</b> them bowed low.
<br>“Would you tell me,” said <b>Alice</b>, a little timidly, “why you are painting those roses?”
<br>Five <b>and</b> Seven said <b>nothing</b>, <b>but</b> looked at Two. Two began <b>in</b> a low voice, “Why <b>the</b> fact <b>is</b>, you see, Miss, this here ought <b>to</b> have been a RED rose-tree, <b>and</b> we put a white one <b>in</b> <b>by</b> mistake; <b>and</b> if <b>the</b> Queen <b>was</b> <b>to</b> find <b>it</b> out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore <b>she</b> comes, <b>to</b>—” At this moment Five, who <b>had</b> been anxiously looking across <b>the</b> garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There <b>was</b> a sound <b>of</b> many footsteps, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> looked round, eager <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like <b>the</b> three gardeners, oblong <b>and</b> flat, with their hands <b>and</b> feet at <b>the</b> corners: next <b>the</b> ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, <b>and</b> walked two <b>and</b> two, as <b>the</b> soldiers did. After these came <b>the</b> royal children; there were ten <b>of</b> them, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> little dears came jumping merrily along hand <b>in</b> hand, <b>in</b> couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came <b>the</b> guests, mostly Kings <b>and</b> Queens, <b>and</b> among them <b>Alice</b> recognised <b>the</b> White Rabbit: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> talking <b>in</b> a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that <b>was</b> said, <b>and</b> went <b>by</b> <b>without</b> noticing <b>her</b>. Then followed <b>the</b> Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, carrying <b>the</b> King's crown <b>on</b> a crimson velvet cushion; <b>and</b>, last <b>of</b> all this grand procession, came <b>THE</b> KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> rather doubtful whether <b>she</b> ought not <b>to</b> lie down <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face like <b>the</b> three gardeners, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> could not remember every <b>having</b> heard <b>of</b> such a rule at processions; “<b>and</b> besides, <b>what</b> would be <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a procession,” <b>thought</b> <b>she</b>, “if people <b>had</b> all <b>to</b> lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see <b>it</b>?” So <b>she</b> stood still where <b>she</b> <b>was</b>, <b>and</b> waited.
<br>When <b>the</b> procession came opposite <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, they all stopped <b>and</b> looked at <b>her</b>, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen said severely “Who <b>is</b> this?” She said <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, who only bowed <b>and</b> smiled <b>in</b> reply.
<br>“Idiot!” said <b>the</b> Queen, tossing <b>her</b> head impatiently; <b>and</b>, turning <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, “What's your name, child?”
<br>“My name <b>is</b> <b>Alice</b>, so please your Majesty,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>very</b> politely; <b>but</b> <b>she</b> added, <b>to</b> herself, “Why, they're only a pack <b>of</b> cards, after all. <b>I</b> needn't be afraid <b>of</b> them!”
<br>“And who are THESE?” said <b>the</b> Queen, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners who were lying round <b>the</b> rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying <b>on</b> their faces, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pattern <b>on</b> their backs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pack, <b>she</b> could not tell whether they were gardeners, <b>or</b> soldiers, <b>or</b> courtiers, <b>or</b> three <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own children.
<br>“How should <b>I</b> know?” said <b>Alice</b>, surprised at <b>her</b> own courage. “It's <b>no</b> business <b>of</b> MINE.”
<br>The Queen turned crimson with fury, <b>and</b>, after glaring at <b>her</b> for a moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with <b>her</b> head! Off—”
<br>“Nonsense!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>very</b> loudly <b>and</b> decidedly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen <b>was</b> silent.
<br>The King laid his hand upon <b>her</b> arm, <b>and</b> timidly said “Consider, my dear: <b>she</b> <b>is</b> only a child!”
<br>The Queen turned angrily away from him, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave “Turn them over!”
<br>The Knave did so, <b>very</b> carefully, with one foot.
<br>“Get up!” said <b>the</b> Queen, <b>in</b> a shrill, loud voice, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three gardeners instantly jumped up, <b>and</b> began bowing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King, <b>the</b> Queen, <b>the</b> royal children, <b>and</b> everybody else.
<br>“Leave off that!” screamed <b>the</b> Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rose-tree, <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, “What HAVE you been doing here?”
<br>“May <b>it</b> please your Majesty,” said Two, <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> humble tone, going down <b>on</b> one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”
<br>“<b>I</b> see!” said <b>the</b> Queen, who <b>had</b> meanwhile been examining <b>the</b> roses. “Off with their heads!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> procession moved <b>on</b>, three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers remaining behind <b>to</b> execute <b>the</b> unfortunate gardeners, who ran <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> for protection.
<br>“You shan't be beheaded!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> put them <b>into</b> a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute <b>or</b> two, looking for them, <b>and</b> then quietly marched off after <b>the</b> others.
<br>“Are their heads off?” shouted <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Their heads are gone, if <b>it</b> please your Majesty!” <b>the</b> soldiers shouted <b>in</b> reply.
<br>“That's right!” shouted <b>the</b> Queen. “Can you play croquet?”
<br>The soldiers were silent, <b>and</b> looked at <b>Alice</b>, as <b>the</b> question <b>was</b> evidently meant for <b>her</b>.
<br>“Yes!” shouted <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>, then!” roared <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> joined <b>the</b> procession, wondering <b>very</b> much <b>what</b> would happen next.
<br>“It's—<b>it</b>'s a <b>very</b> fine day!” said a timid voice at <b>her</b> side. She <b>was</b> walking <b>by</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit, who <b>was</b> peeping anxiously <b>into</b> <b>her</b> face.
<br>“Very,” said <b>Alice</b>: “—where's <b>the</b> Duchess?”
<br>“Hush! Hush!” said <b>the</b> Rabbit <b>in</b> a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, <b>and</b> then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ear, <b>and</b> whispered “She's under sentence <b>of</b> execution.”
<br>“What for?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Did you say «What a pity!»?” <b>the</b> Rabbit asked.
<br>“No, <b>I</b> didn't,” said <b>Alice</b>: “<b>I</b> don't think <b>it</b>'s at all a pity. <b>I</b> said «What for?"“
<br>“She boxed <b>the</b> Queen's ears—” <b>the</b> Rabbit began. <b>Alice</b> gave a little scream <b>of</b> laughter. “Oh, hush!” <b>the</b> Rabbit whispered <b>in</b> a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, <b>she</b> came rather late, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen said—”
<br>“Get <b>to</b> your places!” shouted <b>the</b> Queen <b>in</b> a voice <b>of</b> thunder, <b>and</b> people began running about <b>in</b> all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down <b>in</b> a minute <b>or</b> two, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game began. <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never seen such a curious croquet-ground <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all ridges <b>and</b> furrows; <b>the</b> balls were live hedgehogs, <b>the</b> mallets live flamingoes, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> soldiers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> double themselves up <b>and</b> <b>to</b> stand <b>on</b> their hands <b>and</b> feet, <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> arches.
<br>The chief difficulty <b>Alice</b> found at first <b>was</b> <b>in</b> managing <b>her</b> flamingo: <b>she</b> succeeded <b>in</b> getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under <b>her</b> arm, with its legs hanging down, <b>but</b> generally, just as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got its neck nicely straightened out, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> hedgehog a blow with its head, <b>it</b> WOULD twist itself round <b>and</b> look up <b>in</b> <b>her</b> face, with such a puzzled expression that <b>she</b> could not help bursting out laughing: <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got its head down, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> begin again, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> provoking <b>to</b> find that <b>the</b> hedgehog <b>had</b> unrolled itself, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act <b>of</b> crawling away: besides all this, there <b>was</b> generally a ridge <b>or</b> furrow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way wherever <b>she</b> wanted <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> hedgehog <b>to</b>, <b>and</b>, as <b>the</b> doubled-up soldiers were always getting up <b>and</b> walking off <b>to</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, <b>Alice</b> soon came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a <b>very</b> difficult game indeed.
<br>The players all played at <b>once</b> <b>without</b> waiting for turns, quarrelling all <b>the</b> while, <b>and</b> fighting for <b>the</b> hedgehogs; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> short time <b>the</b> Queen <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a furious passion, <b>and</b> went stamping about, <b>and</b> shouting “Off with his head!” <b>or</b> “Off with <b>her</b> head!” about <b>once</b> <b>in</b> a minute.
<br><b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> feel <b>very</b> uneasy: <b>to</b> be sure, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not as yet <b>had</b> any dispute with <b>the</b> Queen, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> knew that <b>it</b> might happen any minute, “<b>and</b> then,” <b>thought</b> <b>she</b>, “<b>what</b> would become <b>of</b> me? They're dreadfully fond <b>of</b> beheading people here; <b>the</b> great wonder <b>is</b>, that there's any one left alive!”
<br>She <b>was</b> looking about for some way <b>of</b> escape, <b>and</b> wondering whether <b>she</b> could <b>get</b> away <b>without</b> being seen, when <b>she</b> noticed a curious appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air: <b>it</b> puzzled <b>her</b> <b>very</b> much at first, <b>but</b>, after watching <b>it</b> a minute <b>or</b> two, <b>she</b> made <b>it</b> out <b>to</b> be a grin, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself “It's <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat: now <b>I</b> shall have somebody <b>to</b> talk <b>to</b>.”
<br>“How are you getting <b>on</b>?” said <b>the</b> Cat, as soon as there <b>was</b> mouth enough for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> speak with.
<br><b>Alice</b> waited till <b>the</b> eyes appeared, <b>and</b> then nodded. “It's <b>no</b> <b>use</b> speaking <b>to</b> <b>it</b>,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>, “till its ears have come, <b>or</b> at least one <b>of</b> them.” In another minute <b>the</b> whole head appeared, <b>and</b> then <b>Alice</b> put down <b>her</b> flamingo, <b>and</b> began an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, feeling <b>very</b> glad <b>she</b> <b>had</b> someone <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>her</b>. The Cat seemed <b>to</b> think that there <b>was</b> enough <b>of</b> <b>it</b> now <b>in</b> sight, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> more <b>of</b> <b>it</b> appeared.
<br>“<b>I</b> don't think they play at all fairly,” <b>Alice</b> began, <b>in</b> rather a complaining tone,” <b>and</b> they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak—<b>and</b> they don't seem <b>to</b> have any rules <b>in</b> particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends <b>to</b> them—<b>and</b> you've <b>no</b> idea how confusing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> all <b>the</b> things being alive; for instance, there's <b>the</b> arch <b>I</b>'ve got <b>to</b> go through next walking about at <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground—<b>and</b> <b>I</b> should have croqueted <b>the</b> Queen's hedgehog just now, only <b>it</b> ran away when <b>it</b> saw mine coming?”
<br>“How <b>do</b> you like <b>the</b> Queen?” said <b>the</b> Cat <b>in</b> a low voice.
<br>“Not at all,” said <b>Alice</b>: “<b>she</b>'s so extremely—” Just then <b>she</b> noticed that <b>the</b> Queen <b>was</b> close behind <b>her</b>, listening: so <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, “—likely <b>to</b> win, that <b>it</b>'s hardly worth while finishing <b>the</b> game.”
<br>The Queen smiled <b>and</b> passed <b>on</b>.
<br>“Who ARE you talking <b>to</b>?” said <b>the</b> King, going up <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> looking at <b>the</b> Cat's head with great curiosity.
<br>“It's a friend <b>of</b> mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said <b>Alice</b>: “allow me <b>to</b> introduce <b>it</b>.”
<br>“<b>I</b> don't like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at all,” said <b>the</b> King: “however, <b>it</b> may kiss my hand if <b>it</b> likes.”
<br>“<b>I</b>'d rather not,” <b>the</b> Cat remarked.
<br>“Don't be impertinent,” said <b>the</b> King, “<b>and</b> don't look at me like that!” He got behind <b>Alice</b> as he spoke.
<br>“A cat may look at a king,” said <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b>'ve read that <b>in</b> some <b>book</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> don't remember where.”
<br>“Well, <b>it</b> must be removed,” said <b>the</b> King <b>very</b> decidedly, <b>and</b> he called <b>the</b> Queen, who <b>was</b> passing at <b>the</b> moment, “My dear! <b>I</b> wish you would have this cat removed!”
<br>The Queen <b>had</b> only one way <b>of</b> settling all difficulties, great <b>or</b> small. “Off with his head!” <b>she</b> said, <b>without</b> even looking round.
<br>“<b>I</b>'ll fetch <b>the</b> executioner myself,” said <b>the</b> King eagerly, <b>and</b> he hurried off.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> might as well go back, <b>and</b> see how <b>the</b> game <b>was</b> going <b>on</b>, as <b>she</b> heard <b>the</b> Queen's voice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, screaming with passion. She <b>had</b> already heard <b>her</b> sentence three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> players <b>to</b> be executed for <b>having</b> missed their turns, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> did not like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> things at all, as <b>the</b> game <b>was</b> <b>in</b> such confusion that <b>she</b> never knew whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>her</b> turn <b>or</b> not. So <b>she</b> went <b>in</b> search <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hedgehog.
<br>The hedgehog <b>was</b> engaged <b>in</b> a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b> an excellent opportunity for croqueting one <b>of</b> them with <b>the</b> other: <b>the</b> only difficulty <b>was</b>, that <b>her</b> flamingo <b>was</b> gone across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden, where <b>Alice</b> could see <b>it</b> trying <b>in</b> a helpless sort <b>of</b> way <b>to</b> fly up <b>into</b> a tree.
<br>By <b>the</b> time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> caught <b>the</b> flamingo <b>and</b> brought <b>it</b> back, <b>the</b> fight <b>was</b> over, <b>and</b> both <b>the</b> hedgehogs were out <b>of</b> sight: “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter much,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “as all <b>the</b> arches are gone from <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground.” So <b>she</b> tucked <b>it</b> away under <b>her</b> arm, that <b>it</b> might not escape again, <b>and</b> went back for a little more <b>conversation</b> with <b>her</b> friend.
<br>When <b>she</b> got back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cheshire Cat, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> surprised <b>to</b> find quite a large crowd collected round <b>it</b>: there <b>was</b> a dispute going <b>on</b> between <b>the</b> executioner, <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen, who were all talking at <b>once</b>, while all <b>the</b> rest were quite silent, <b>and</b> looked <b>very</b> uncomfortable.
<br>The moment <b>Alice</b> appeared, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> appealed <b>to</b> <b>by</b> all three <b>to</b> settle <b>the</b> question, <b>and</b> they repeated their arguments <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, though, as they all spoke at <b>once</b>, <b>she</b> found <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard indeed <b>to</b> make out exactly <b>what</b> they said.
<br>The executioner's argument <b>was</b>, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there <b>was</b> a body <b>to</b> cut <b>it</b> off from: that he <b>had</b> never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> such a thing before, <b>and</b> he wasn't going <b>to</b> begin at HIS time <b>of</b> life.
<br>The King's argument <b>was</b>, that anything that <b>had</b> a head could be beheaded, <b>and</b> that you weren't <b>to</b> talk nonsense.
<br>The Queen's argument <b>was</b>, that if something wasn't done about <b>it</b> <b>in</b> less than <b>no</b> time <b>she</b>'d have everybody executed, all round. (It <b>was</b> this last remark that <b>had</b> made <b>the</b> whole party look so grave <b>and</b> anxious.)
<br><b>Alice</b> could think <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> say <b>but</b> “It belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Duchess: you'd better ask HER about <b>it</b>.”
<br>“She's <b>in</b> prison,” <b>the</b> Queen said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> executioner: “fetch <b>her</b> here.” And <b>the</b> executioner went off like an arrow.
<br>The Cat's head began fading away <b>the</b> moment he <b>was</b> gone, <b>and</b>, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time he <b>had</b> disappeared; so <b>the</b> King <b>and</b> <b>the</b> executioner ran wildly up <b>and</b> down looking for <b>it</b>, while <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party went back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game.
<br>

<br><b>Chapter</b> IX
<br><b>THE</b> MOCK TURTLE'S STORY
<br>
<br>“You can't think you glad <b>I</b> am <b>to</b> see you again, you dear old thing!” said <b>the</b> Duchess, as <b>she</b> tucked <b>her</b> arm affectionately <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s, <b>and</b> they walked off together.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> glad <b>to</b> find <b>her</b> <b>in</b> such a pleasant temper, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself that perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only <b>the</b> pepper that <b>had</b> made <b>her</b> so savage when they met <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen.
<br>“When <b>I</b>'M a Duchess,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, (not <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> hopeful tone though), “<b>I</b> won't have any pepper <b>in</b> my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does <b>very</b> well <b>without</b>—Maybe <b>it</b>'s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>, <b>very</b> much pleased at <b>having</b> found out a new kind <b>of</b> rule, “<b>and</b> vinegar that makes them sour—<b>and</b> camomile that makes them bitter—<b>and</b>—<b>and</b> barley-sugar <b>and</b> such things that make children sweet-tempered. <b>I</b> only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about <b>it</b>, you know—”
<br>She <b>had</b> quite forgotten <b>the</b> Duchess <b>by</b> this time, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> a little startled when <b>she</b> heard <b>her</b> voice close <b>to</b> <b>her</b> ear. “You're thinking about something, my dear, <b>and</b> that makes you forget <b>to</b> talk. <b>I</b> can't tell you just now <b>what</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that <b>is</b>, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shall remember <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a bit.”
<br>“Perhaps <b>it</b> hasn't one,” <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> remark.
<br>“Tut, tut, child!” said <b>the</b> Duchess. “Everything's got a moral, if only you can find <b>it</b>.” And <b>she</b> squeezed herself up closer <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>'s side as <b>she</b> spoke.
<br><b>Alice</b> did not much like keeping so close <b>to</b> <b>her</b>: first, because <b>the</b> Duchess <b>was</b> VERY ugly; <b>and</b> secondly, because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> exactly <b>the</b> right height <b>to</b> rest <b>her</b> chin upon <b>Alice</b>'s shoulder, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, <b>she</b> did not like <b>to</b> be rude, so <b>she</b> bore <b>it</b> as well as <b>she</b> could.
<br>“The game's going <b>on</b> rather better now,” <b>she</b> said, <b>by</b> way <b>of</b> keeping up <b>the</b> <b>conversation</b> a little.
<br>“'Tis so,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that <b>is</b>—"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes <b>the</b> world go round!"“
<br>“Somebody said,” <b>Alice</b> whispered, “that <b>it</b>'s done <b>by</b> everybody minding their own business!”
<br>“Ah, well! It means much <b>the</b> same thing,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, digging <b>her</b> sharp little chin <b>into</b> <b>Alice</b>'s shoulder as <b>she</b> added, “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> THAT <b>is</b>—"Take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sense, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sounds will take care <b>of</b> themselves."“
<br>“How fond <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>of</b> finding morals <b>in</b> things!” <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself.
<br>“<b>I</b> dare say you're wondering why <b>I</b> don't put my arm round your waist,” <b>the</b> Duchess said after a pause: “<b>the</b> reason <b>is</b>, that <b>I</b>'m doubtful about <b>the</b> temper <b>of</b> your flamingo. Shall <b>I</b> try <b>the</b> experiment?”
<br>“HE might bite,” <b>Alice</b> cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> experiment tried.
<br>“Very true,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “flamingoes <b>and</b> mustard both bite. And <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that <b>is</b>—"Birds <b>of</b> a feather flock together."“
<br>“Only mustard isn't a bird,” <b>Alice</b> remarked.
<br>“Right, as usual,” said <b>the</b> Duchess: “<b>what</b> a clear way you have <b>of</b> putting things!”
<br>“It's a mineral, <b>I</b> THINK,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Of course <b>it</b> <b>is</b>,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, who seemed ready <b>to</b> agree <b>to</b> everything that <b>Alice</b> said; “there's a large mustard-mine near here. And <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that <b>is</b>—"The more there <b>is</b> <b>of</b> mine, <b>the</b> less there <b>is</b> <b>of</b> yours."“
<br>“Oh, <b>I</b> know!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>, who <b>had</b> not attended <b>to</b> this last remark, “<b>it</b>'s a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b>.”
<br>“<b>I</b> quite agree with you,” said <b>the</b> Duchess; “<b>and</b> <b>the</b> moral <b>of</b> that <b>is</b>—"Be <b>what</b> you would seem <b>to</b> be"—<b>or</b> if you'd like <b>it</b> put more simply—"Never imagine yourself not <b>to</b> be otherwise than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> might appear <b>to</b> others that <b>what</b> you were <b>or</b> might have been <b>was</b> not otherwise than <b>what</b> you <b>had</b> been would have appeared <b>to</b> them <b>to</b> be otherwise."“
<br>“<b>I</b> think <b>I</b> should understand that better,” <b>Alice</b> said <b>very</b> politely, “if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> written down: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> can't quite follow <b>it</b> as you say <b>it</b>.”
<br>“That's <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could say if <b>I</b> chose,” <b>the</b> Duchess replied, <b>in</b> a pleased tone.
<br>“Pray don't trouble yourself <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> any longer than that,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Oh, don't talk about trouble!” said <b>the</b> Duchess. “<b>I</b> make you a present <b>of</b> everything <b>I</b>'ve said as yet.”
<br>“A cheap sort <b>of</b> present!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b>'m glad they don't give birthday presents like that!” But <b>she</b> did not venture <b>to</b> say <b>it</b> out loud.
<br>“Thinking again?” <b>the</b> Duchess asked, with another dig <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sharp little chin.
<br>“<b>I</b>'ve a right <b>to</b> think” said <b>Alice</b> sharply, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> feel a little worried.
<br>“Just about as much right,” said <b>the</b> Duchess, “as pigs have <b>to</b> fly; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> m—”
<br>But here, <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>'s great surprise, <b>the</b> Duchess's voice died away, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>her</b> favourite word “moral,” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arm that <b>was</b> linked <b>into</b> hers began <b>to</b> tremble. <b>Alice</b> looked up, <b>and</b> there stood <b>the</b> Queen <b>in</b> front <b>of</b> them, with <b>her</b> arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
<br>“A fine day, your Majesty!” <b>the</b> Duchess began <b>in</b> a low, weak voice.
<br>“Now, <b>I</b> give you fair warning,” shouted <b>the</b> Queen, stamping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground as <b>she</b> spoke; “either you <b>or</b> your head must be off, <b>and</b> that <b>in</b> about half <b>no</b> time! Take your choice!”
<br>The Duchess took <b>her</b> choice, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> gone <b>in</b> a moment.
<br>“Let's go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> game,” <b>the</b> Queen said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>; <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> too much frightened <b>to</b> say a word, <b>but</b> slowly followed <b>her</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> croquet-ground.
<br>The other guests <b>had</b> taken advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's absence, <b>and</b> were resting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade: however, <b>the</b> moment they saw <b>her</b>, they hurried back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game, <b>the</b> Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.
<br>All <b>the</b> time they were playing <b>the</b> Queen never left off quarrelling with <b>the</b> other players, <b>and</b> shouting “Off with his head!” <b>or</b> “Off with <b>her</b> head!” Those whom <b>she</b> sentenced were taken <b>into</b> custody <b>by</b> <b>the</b> soldiers, who <b>of</b> course <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave off being arches <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, so that <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> half an hour <b>or</b> so there were <b>no</b> arches left, <b>and</b> all <b>the</b> players, except <b>the</b> King, <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b>, were <b>in</b> custody <b>and</b> under sentence <b>of</b> execution.
<br>Then <b>the</b> Queen left off, quite out <b>of</b> breath, <b>and</b> said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, “Have you seen <b>the</b> Mock Turtle yet?”
<br>“No,” said <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b> don't even know <b>what</b> a Mock Turtle <b>is</b>.”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> thing Mock Turtle Soup <b>is</b> made from,” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“<b>I</b> never saw one, <b>or</b> heard <b>of</b> one,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>, then,” said <b>the</b> Queen, “<b>and</b> he shall tell you his history,”
<br>As they walked off together, <b>Alice</b> heard <b>the</b> King say <b>in</b> a low voice, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, THAT'S a good thing!” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> felt quite unhappy at <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> executions <b>the</b> Queen <b>had</b> ordered.
<br>They <b>very</b> soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. (IF you don't know <b>what</b> a Gryphon <b>is</b>, look at <b>the</b> picture.) “Up, lazy thing!” said <b>the</b> Queen, “<b>and</b> take this young lady <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> hear his history. <b>I</b> must go back <b>and</b> see after some executions <b>I</b> have ordered'; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> walked off, leaving <b>Alice</b> alone with <b>the</b> Gryphon. <b>Alice</b> did not quite like <b>the</b> look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creature, <b>but</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be quite as safe <b>to</b> stay with <b>it</b> as <b>to</b> go after that savage Queen: so <b>she</b> waited.
<br>The Gryphon sat up <b>and</b> rubbed its eyes: then <b>it</b> watched <b>the</b> Queen till <b>she</b> <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> sight: then <b>it</b> chuckled. “What fun!” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, half <b>to</b> itself, half <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“What IS <b>the</b> fun?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why, SHE,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “It's all <b>her</b> fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>“Everybody says «come <b>on</b>!» here,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, as <b>she</b> went slowly after <b>it</b>: “<b>I</b> never <b>was</b> so ordered about <b>in</b> all my life, never!”
<br>They <b>had</b> not gone far before they saw <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance, <b>sitting</b> sad <b>and</b> lonely <b>on</b> a little ledge <b>of</b> rock, <b>and</b>, as they came nearer, <b>Alice</b> could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply. “What <b>is</b> his sorrow?” <b>she</b> asked <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon answered, <b>very</b> nearly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same words as before, “It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got <b>no</b> sorrow, you know. Come <b>on</b>!”
<br>So they went up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full <b>of</b> tears, <b>but</b> said <b>nothing</b>.
<br>“This here young lady,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “<b>she</b> wants for <b>to</b> know your history, <b>she</b> <b>do</b>.”
<br>“<b>I</b>'ll tell <b>it</b> <b>her</b>,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>in</b> a deep, hollow tone: “sit down, both <b>of</b> you, <b>and</b> don't speak a word till <b>I</b>'ve finished.”
<br>So they sat down, <b>and</b> nobody spoke for some minutes. <b>Alice</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself, “<b>I</b> don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.” But <b>she</b> waited patiently.
<br>“Once,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “<b>I</b> <b>was</b> a real Turtle.”
<br>These words were followed <b>by</b> a <b>very</b> long silence, broken only <b>by</b> an occasional exclamation <b>of</b> “Hjckrrh!” from <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> constant heavy sobbing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle. <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> nearly getting up <b>and</b> saying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” <b>but</b> <b>she</b> could not help thinking there MUST be more <b>to</b> come, so <b>she</b> sat still <b>and</b> said <b>nothing</b>.
<br>“When we were little,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle went <b>on</b> at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now <b>and</b> then, “we went <b>to</b> school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea. The master <b>was</b> an old Turtle—we used <b>to</b> call him Tortoise—”
<br>“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?” <b>Alice</b> asked.
<br>“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle angrily: “really you are <b>very</b> dull!”
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> be ashamed <b>of</b> yourself for asking such a simple question,” added <b>the</b> Gryphon; <b>and</b> then they both sat silent <b>and</b> looked at poor <b>Alice</b>, who felt ready <b>to</b> sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> earth. At last <b>the</b> Gryphon said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “Drive <b>on</b>, old fellow! Don't be all day about <b>it</b>!” <b>and</b> he went <b>on</b> <b>in</b> these words:
<br>“Yes, we went <b>to</b> school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea, though you mayn't believe <b>it</b>—”
<br>“<b>I</b> never said <b>I</b> didn't!” interrupted <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You did,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Hold your tongue!” added <b>the</b> Gryphon, before <b>Alice</b> could speak again. The Mock Turtle went <b>on</b>.
<br>“We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best <b>of</b> educations—<b>in</b> fact, we went <b>to</b> school every day—”
<br>“<b>I</b>'VE been <b>to</b> a day-school, too,” said <b>Alice</b>; “you needn't be so proud as all that.”
<br>“With extras?” asked <b>the</b> Mock Turtle a little anxiously.
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b>, “we learned French <b>and</b> music.”
<br>“And washing?” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Certainly not!” said <b>Alice</b> indignantly.
<br>“Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> great relief. “Now at OURS they <b>had</b> at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill, «French, music, AND WASHING—extra."“
<br>“You couldn't have wanted <b>it</b> much,” said <b>Alice</b>; “living at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea.”
<br>“<b>I</b> couldn't afford <b>to</b> learn <b>it</b>.” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle with a sigh. “<b>I</b> only took <b>the</b> regular course.”
<br>“What <b>was</b> that?” inquired <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Reeling <b>and</b> Writhing, <b>of</b> course, <b>to</b> begin with,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied; “<b>and</b> then <b>the</b> different branches <b>of</b> Arithmetic— Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, <b>and</b> Derision.”
<br>“<b>I</b> never heard <b>of</b> «Uglification,» <b>Alice</b> ventured <b>to</b> say. “What <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws <b>in</b> surprise. “What! Never heard <b>of</b> uglifying!” <b>it</b> exclaimed. “You know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> beautify <b>is</b>, <b>I</b> suppose?”
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b> doubtfully: “<b>it</b> means—<b>to</b>—make—anything— prettier.”
<br>“Well, then,” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b>, “if you don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> uglify <b>is</b>, you ARE a simpleton.”
<br><b>Alice</b> did not feel encouraged <b>to</b> ask any more questions about <b>it</b>, so <b>she</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, <b>and</b> said “What else <b>had</b> you <b>to</b> learn?”
<br>“Well, there <b>was</b> Mystery,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied, counting off <b>the</b> subjects <b>on</b> his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient <b>and</b> modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—<b>the</b> Drawling-master <b>was</b> an old conger-eel, that used <b>to</b> come <b>once</b> a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, <b>and</b> Fainting <b>in</b> Coils.”
<br>“What <b>was</b> THAT like?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b> can't show <b>it</b> you myself,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “<b>I</b>'m too stiff. And <b>the</b> Gryphon never learnt <b>it</b>.”
<br>“Hadn't time,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: “<b>I</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Classics master, though. He <b>was</b> an old crab, HE <b>was</b>.”
<br>“<b>I</b> never went <b>to</b> him,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught Laughing <b>and</b> Grief, they used <b>to</b> say.”
<br>“So he did, so he did,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, sighing <b>in</b> his turn; <b>and</b> both creatures hid their faces <b>in</b> their paws.
<br>“And how many hours a day did you <b>do</b> lessons?” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>in</b> a hurry <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject.
<br>“Ten hours <b>the</b> first day,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “nine <b>the</b> next, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>.”
<br>“What a curious plan!” exclaimed <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“That's <b>the</b> reason they're called lessons,” <b>the</b> Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day <b>to</b> day.”
<br>This <b>was</b> quite a new idea <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> over a little before <b>she</b> made <b>her</b> next remark. “Then <b>the</b> eleventh day must have been a holiday?”
<br>“Of course <b>it</b> <b>was</b>,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“And how did you manage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> twelfth?” <b>Alice</b> went <b>on</b> eagerly.
<br>“That's enough about lessons,” <b>the</b> Gryphon interrupted <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> decided tone: “tell <b>her</b> something about <b>the</b> games now.”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> X
<br><b>THE</b> LOBSTER QUADRILLE
<br>
<br>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, <b>and</b> drew <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> one flapper across his eyes. He looked at <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> speak, <b>but</b> for a minute <b>or</b> two sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he <b>had</b> a bone <b>in</b> his throat,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: <b>and</b> <b>it</b> set <b>to</b> work shaking him <b>and</b> punching him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back. At last <b>the</b> Mock Turtle recovered his voice, <b>and</b>, with tears running down his cheeks, he went <b>on</b> again:—
<br>“You may not have lived much under <b>the</b> sea—” (<b>I</b> haven't,” said <b>Alice</b>)—`<b>and</b> perhaps you were never even introduced <b>to</b> a lobster- -” (<b>Alice</b> began <b>to</b> say “<b>I</b> <b>once</b> tasted—” <b>but</b> checked herself hastily, <b>and</b> said “No, never') “—so you can have <b>no</b> idea <b>what</b> a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille <b>is</b>!”
<br>“No, indeed,” said <b>Alice</b>. “What sort <b>of</b> a dance <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?”
<br>“Why,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “you first form <b>into</b> a line along <b>the</b> sea-shore—”
<br>“Two lines!” cried <b>the</b> Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, <b>and</b> so <b>on</b>; then, when you've cleared all <b>the</b> jelly-fish out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way—”
<br>“THAT generally takes some time,” interrupted <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“—you advance <b>twice</b>—”
<br>“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Of course,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “advance <b>twice</b>, set <b>to</b> partners—”
<br>“—change lobsters, <b>and</b> retire <b>in</b> same order,” continued <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Then, you know,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle went <b>on</b>, “you throw <b>the</b>—”
<br>“The lobsters!” shouted <b>the</b> Gryphon, with a bound <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air.
<br>“—as far out <b>to</b> sea as you can—”
<br>“Swim after them!” screamed <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Back <b>to</b> land again, <b>and</b> that's all <b>the</b> first figure,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two creatures, who <b>had</b> been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again <b>very</b> sadly <b>and</b> quietly, <b>and</b> looked at <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“It must be a <b>very</b> pretty dance,” said <b>Alice</b> timidly.
<br>“Would you like <b>to</b> see a little <b>of</b> <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“Very much indeed,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Come, let's try <b>the</b> first figure!” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon. “We can <b>do</b> <b>without</b> lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
<br>“Oh, YOU sing,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “<b>I</b>'ve forgotten <b>the</b> words.”
<br>So they began solemnly dancing round <b>and</b> round <b>Alice</b>, every now <b>and</b> then treading <b>on</b> <b>her</b> toes when they passed too close, <b>and</b> waving their forepaws <b>to</b> mark <b>the</b> time, while <b>the</b> Mock Turtle sang this, <b>very</b> slowly <b>and</b> sadly:—
<br>“"Will you walk a little faster?» said a whiting <b>to</b> a snail. «There's a porpoise close behind us, <b>and</b> he's treading <b>on</b> my tail. See how eagerly <b>the</b> lobsters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> turtles all advance! They are waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shingle—will you come <b>and</b> join <b>the</b> dance?
<br>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join <b>the</b> dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join <b>the</b> dance?
<br>«You can really have <b>no</b> notion how delightful <b>it</b> will be When they take us up <b>and</b> throw us, with <b>the</b> lobsters, out <b>to</b>
<br>sea!» But <b>the</b> snail replied «Too far, too far!» <b>and</b> gave a look
<br>askance— Said he thanked <b>the</b> whiting kindly, <b>but</b> he would not join <b>the</b> dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
<br><b>the</b> dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
<br><b>the</b> dance.
<br>“"What matters <b>it</b> how far we go?» his scaly friend replied. «There <b>is</b> another shore, you know, upon <b>the</b> other side. The further off from England <b>the</b> nearer <b>is</b> <b>to</b> France— Then turn not pale, beloved snail, <b>but</b> come <b>and</b> join <b>the</b> dance.
<br>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join <b>the</b>
<br>dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join <b>the</b>
<br>dance?"“
<br>“Thank you, <b>it</b>'s a <b>very</b> interesting dance <b>to</b> watch,” said <b>Alice</b>, feeling <b>very</b> glad that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> over at last: “<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so like that curious song about <b>the</b> whiting!”
<br>“Oh, as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whiting,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “they—you've seen them, <b>of</b> course?”
<br>“Yes,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>I</b>'ve often seen them at dinn—” <b>she</b> checked herself hastily.
<br>“<b>I</b> don't know where Dinn may be,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle, “<b>but</b> if you've seen them so often, <b>of</b> course you know <b>what</b> they're like.”
<br>“<b>I</b> believe so,” <b>Alice</b> replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails <b>in</b> their mouths—<b>and</b> they're all over crumbs.”
<br>“You're wrong about <b>the</b> crumbs,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “crumbs would all wash off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea. But they HAVE their tails <b>in</b> their mouths; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reason <b>is</b>—” here <b>the</b> Mock Turtle yawned <b>and</b> shut his eyes.—`Tell <b>her</b> about <b>the</b> reason <b>and</b> all that,” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“The reason <b>is</b>,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon, “that they WOULD go with <b>the</b> lobsters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dance. So they got thrown out <b>to</b> sea. So they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fall a long way. So they got their tails fast <b>in</b> their mouths. So they couldn't <b>get</b> them out again. That's all.”
<br>“Thank you,” said <b>Alice</b>, “<b>it</b>'s <b>very</b> interesting. <b>I</b> never knew so much about a whiting before.”
<br>“<b>I</b> can tell you more than that, if you like,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “Do you know why <b>it</b>'s called a whiting?”
<br>“<b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> about <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>. “Why?”
<br>“IT DOES <b>THE</b> BOOTS AND SHOES.” <b>the</b> Gryphon replied <b>very</b> solemnly.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> thoroughly puzzled. “Does <b>the</b> boots <b>and</b> shoes!” <b>she</b> repeated <b>in</b> a wondering tone.
<br>“Why, <b>what</b> are YOUR shoes done with?” said <b>the</b> Gryphon. “<b>I</b> mean, <b>what</b> makes them so shiny?”
<br><b>Alice</b> looked down at them, <b>and</b> considered a little before <b>she</b> gave <b>her</b> answer. “They're done with blacking, <b>I</b> believe.”
<br>“Boots <b>and</b> shoes under <b>the</b> sea,” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a deep voice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”
<br>“And <b>what</b> are they made <b>of</b>?” <b>Alice</b> asked <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> great curiosity.
<br>“Soles <b>and</b> eels, <b>of</b> course,” <b>the</b> Gryphon replied rather impatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”
<br>“If <b>I</b>'d been <b>the</b> whiting,” said <b>Alice</b>, whose thoughts were still running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> song, “<b>I</b>'d have said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porpoise, «Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"“
<br>“They were obliged <b>to</b> have him with them,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle said: “<b>no</b> wise fish would go anywhere <b>without</b> a porpoise.”
<br>“Wouldn't <b>it</b> really?” said <b>Alice</b> <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> great surprise.
<br>“Of course not,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came <b>to</b> ME, <b>and</b> told me he <b>was</b> going a journey, <b>I</b> should say «With <b>what</b> porpoise?"“
<br>“Don't you mean «purpose»?” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“<b>I</b> mean <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle replied <b>in</b> an offended tone. And <b>the</b> Gryphon added “Come, let's hear some <b>of</b> YOUR adventures.”
<br>“<b>I</b> could tell you my adventures—<b>beginning</b> from this morning,” said <b>Alice</b> a little timidly: “<b>but</b> <b>it</b>'s <b>no</b> <b>use</b> going back <b>to</b> yesterday, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a different person then.”
<br>“Explain all that,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“No, <b>no</b>! The adventures first,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon <b>in</b> an impatient tone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”
<br>So <b>Alice</b> began telling them <b>her</b> adventures from <b>the</b> time when <b>she</b> first saw <b>the</b> White Rabbit. She <b>was</b> a little nervous about <b>it</b> just at first, <b>the</b> two creatures got so close <b>to</b> <b>her</b>, one <b>on</b> each side, <b>and</b> opened their eyes <b>and</b> mouths so VERY wide, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> gained courage as <b>she</b> went <b>on</b>. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till <b>she</b> got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> part about <b>her</b> repeating “YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,” <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caterpillar, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words all coming different, <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> Mock Turtle drew a long breath, <b>and</b> said “That's <b>very</b> curious.”
<br>“It's all about as curious as <b>it</b> can be,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“It all came different!” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “<b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> hear <b>her</b> try <b>and</b> repeat something now. Tell <b>her</b> <b>to</b> begin.” He looked at <b>the</b> Gryphon as if he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> some kind <b>of</b> authority over <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Stand up <b>and</b> repeat «'TIS <b>THE</b> VOICE OF <b>THE</b> SLUGGARD,"“ said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“How <b>the</b> creatures order one about, <b>and</b> make one repeat lessons!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>; “<b>I</b> might as well be at school at <b>once</b>.” However, <b>she</b> got up, <b>and</b> began <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, <b>but</b> <b>her</b> head <b>was</b> so full <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster Quadrille, that <b>she</b> hardly knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> saying, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> words came <b>very</b> queer indeed:—
<br>«'Tis <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster; <b>I</b> heard him declare, «You have baked me too brown, <b>I</b> must sugar my hair.» As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt <b>and</b> his buttons, <b>and</b> turns out his toes.”
<br>[later editions continued as follows When <b>the</b> sands are all dry, he <b>is</b> gay as a lark, And will talk <b>in</b> contemptuous tones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shark, But, when <b>the</b> tide rises <b>and</b> sharks are around, His voice has a timid <b>and</b> tremulous sound.]
<br>“That's different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> used <b>to</b> say when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a child,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b> never heard <b>it</b> before,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> sounds uncommon nonsense.”
<br><b>Alice</b> said <b>nothing</b>; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sat down with <b>her</b> face <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen <b>in</b> a natural way again.
<br>“<b>I</b> should like <b>to</b> have <b>it</b> explained,” said <b>the</b> Mock Turtle.
<br>“She can't explain <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon hastily. “Go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> next verse.”
<br>“But about his toes?” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle persisted. “How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> first position <b>in</b> dancing.” <b>Alice</b> said; <b>but</b> <b>was</b> dreadfully puzzled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, <b>and</b> longed <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> subject.
<br>“Go <b>on</b> with <b>the</b> next verse,” <b>the</b> Gryphon repeated impatiently: “<b>it</b> begins «<b>I</b> passed <b>by</b> his garden."“
<br><b>Alice</b> did not dare <b>to</b> disobey, though <b>she</b> felt sure <b>it</b> would all come wrong, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> went <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a trembling voice:—
<br>“<b>I</b> passed <b>by</b> his garden, <b>and</b> marked, with one eye, How <b>the</b> Owl <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Panther were sharing a pie—”
<br>[later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie-crust, <b>and</b> gravy, <b>and</b> meat, While <b>the</b> Owl <b>had</b> <b>the</b> dish as its share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treat. When <b>the</b> pie <b>was</b> all finished, <b>the</b> Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted <b>to</b> pocket <b>the</b> spoon: While <b>the</b> Panther received knife <b>and</b> fork with a growl, And concluded <b>the</b> banquet—]
<br>“What IS <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> repeating all that stuff,” <b>the</b> Mock Turtle interrupted, “if you don't explain <b>it</b> as you go <b>on</b>? It's <b>by</b> far <b>the</b> most confusing thing <b>I</b> ever heard!”
<br>“Yes, <b>I</b> think you'd better leave off,” said <b>the</b> Gryphon: <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> <b>was</b> only too glad <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.
<br>“Shall we try another figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lobster Quadrille?” <b>the</b> Gryphon went <b>on</b>. “Or would you like <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>to</b> sing you a song?”
<br>“Oh, a song, please, if <b>the</b> Mock Turtle would be so kind,” <b>Alice</b> replied, so eagerly that <b>the</b> Gryphon said, <b>in</b> a rather offended toe, “Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing <b>her</b> «Turtle Soup,» will you, old fellow?”
<br>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, <b>and</b> began, <b>in</b> a voice sometimes choked with sobs, <b>to</b> sing this:—
<br>
<br>“Beautiful Soup, so rich <b>and</b> green,
<br>Waiting <b>in</b> a hot tureen!
<br>Who for such dainties would not stoop?
<br>Soup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, beautiful Soup!
<br>
<br>Soup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, beautiful Soup!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!
<br>
<br>“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,
<br>Game, <b>or</b> any other dish?
<br>Who would not give all else for two penny
<br>worth only <b>of</b> beautiful Soup?
<br>Pennyworth only <b>of</b> beautiful Soup?
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
<br>Beau—ootiful Soo—oop! Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”
<br>
<br>“Chorus again!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle <b>had</b> just begun <b>to</b> repeat <b>it</b>, when a cry <b>of</b> “The trial's <b>beginning</b>!” <b>was</b> heard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance.
<br>“Come <b>on</b>!” cried <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b>, taking <b>Alice</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hand, <b>it</b> hurried off, <b>without</b> waiting for <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song.
<br>“What trial <b>is</b> <b>it</b>?” <b>Alice</b> panted as <b>she</b> ran; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon only answered “Come <b>on</b>!” <b>and</b> ran <b>the</b> faster, while more <b>and</b> more faintly came, carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breeze that followed them, <b>the</b> melancholy words:—
<br>
<br>“Soo—oop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e—e—evening,
<br>Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> XI
<br>WHO STOLE <b>THE</b> TARTS?
<br>
<br>The King <b>and</b> Queen <b>of</b> Hearts were seated <b>on</b> their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts <b>of</b> little birds <b>and</b> beasts, as well as <b>the</b> whole pack <b>of</b> cards: <b>the</b> Knave <b>was</b> standing before them, <b>in</b> chains, with a soldier <b>on</b> each side <b>to</b> guard him; <b>and</b> near <b>the</b> King <b>was</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit, with a trumpet <b>in</b> one hand, <b>and</b> a scroll <b>of</b> parchment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other. In <b>the</b> <b>very</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court <b>was</b> a table, with a large dish <b>of</b> tarts upon <b>it</b>: they looked so good, that <b>it</b> made <b>Alice</b> quite hungry <b>to</b> look at them—`<b>I</b> wish they'd <b>get</b> <b>the</b> trial done,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>, “<b>and</b> hand round <b>the</b> refreshments!” But there seemed <b>to</b> be <b>no</b> chance <b>of</b> this, so <b>she</b> began looking at everything about <b>her</b>, <b>to</b> pass away <b>the</b> time.
<br><b>Alice</b> <b>had</b> never been <b>in</b> a court <b>of</b> justice before, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> read about them <b>in</b> books, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite pleased <b>to</b> find that <b>she</b> knew <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> nearly everything there. “That's <b>the</b> judge,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself, “because <b>of</b> his great wig.”
<br>The judge, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> King; <b>and</b> as he wore his crown over <b>the</b> wig, (look at <b>the</b> frontispiece if you want <b>to</b> see how he did <b>it</b>,) he did not look at all comfortable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> certainly not becoming.
<br>“And that's <b>the</b> jury-box,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>, “<b>and</b> those twelve creatures,” (<b>she</b> <b>was</b> obliged <b>to</b> say “creatures,” you see, because some <b>of</b> them were animals, <b>and</b> some were birds,) “<b>I</b> suppose they are <b>the</b> jurors.” She said this last word two <b>or</b> three times over <b>to</b> herself, being rather proud <b>of</b> <b>it</b>: for <b>she</b> <b>thought</b>, <b>and</b> rightly too, that <b>very</b> few little girls <b>of</b> <b>her</b> age knew <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>it</b> at all. However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.
<br>The twelve jurors were all writing <b>very</b> busily <b>on</b> slates. “What are they doing?” <b>Alice</b> whispered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon. “They can't have anything <b>to</b> put down yet, before <b>the</b> trial's begun.”
<br>“They're putting down their names,” <b>the</b> Gryphon whispered <b>in</b> reply, “for fear they should forget them before <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial.”
<br>“Stupid things!” <b>Alice</b> began <b>in</b> a loud, indignant voice, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> stopped hastily, for <b>the</b> White Rabbit cried out, “Silence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court!” <b>and</b> <b>the</b> King put <b>on</b> his spectacles <b>and</b> looked anxiously round, <b>to</b> make out who <b>was</b> talking.
<br><b>Alice</b> could see, as well as if <b>she</b> were looking over their shoulders, that all <b>the</b> jurors were writing down “stupid things!” <b>on</b> their slates, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> could even make out that one <b>of</b> them didn't know how <b>to</b> spell “stupid,” <b>and</b> that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask his neighbour <b>to</b> tell him. “A nice muddle their slates'll be <b>in</b> before <b>the</b> trial's over!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurors <b>had</b> a pencil that squeaked. This <b>of</b> course, <b>Alice</b> could not stand, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> went round <b>the</b> court <b>and</b> got behind him, <b>and</b> <b>very</b> soon found an opportunity <b>of</b> taking <b>it</b> away. She did <b>it</b> so quickly that <b>the</b> poor little juror (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> Bill, <b>the</b> Lizard) could not make out at all <b>what</b> <b>had</b> become <b>of</b> <b>it</b>; so, after hunting all about for <b>it</b>, he <b>was</b> obliged <b>to</b> write with one finger for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day; <b>and</b> this <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>very</b> little <b>use</b>, as <b>it</b> left <b>no</b> mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slate.
<br>“Herald, read <b>the</b> accusation!” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>On this <b>the</b> White Rabbit blew three blasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trumpet, <b>and</b> then unrolled <b>the</b> parchment scroll, <b>and</b> read as follows:—
<br>“The Queen <b>of</b> Hearts, <b>she</b> made some tarts,
<br>All <b>on</b> a summer day:
<br>The Knave <b>of</b> Hearts, he stole those tarts,
<br>And took them quite away!”
<br>“Consider your verdict,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury.
<br>“Not yet, not yet!” <b>the</b> Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There's a great deal <b>to</b> come before that!”
<br>“Call <b>the</b> first witness,” said <b>the</b> King; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> White Rabbit blew three blasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trumpet, <b>and</b> called out, “First witness!”
<br>The first witness <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Hatter. He came <b>in</b> with a teacup <b>in</b> one hand <b>and</b> a piece <b>of</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other. “<b>I</b> beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these <b>in</b>: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> hadn't quite finished my tea when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sent for.”
<br>“You ought <b>to</b> have finished,” said <b>the</b> King. “When did you begin?”
<br>The Hatter looked at <b>the</b> March Hare, who <b>had</b> followed him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> court, arm-<b>in</b>-arm with <b>the</b> Dormouse. “Fourteenth <b>of</b> March, <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> <b>was</b>,” he said.
<br>“Fifteenth,” said <b>the</b> March Hare.
<br>“Sixteenth,” added <b>the</b> Dormouse.
<br>“Write that down,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> jury eagerly wrote down all three dates <b>on</b> their slates, <b>and</b> then added them up, <b>and</b> reduced <b>the</b> answer <b>to</b> shillings <b>and</b> pence.
<br>“Take off your hat,” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“It isn't mine,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“Stolen!” <b>the</b> King exclaimed, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, who instantly made a memorandum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact.
<br>“<b>I</b> keep them <b>to</b> sell,” <b>the</b> Hatter added as an explanation; “<b>I</b>'ve none <b>of</b> my own. <b>I</b>'m a hatter.”
<br>Here <b>the</b> Queen put <b>on</b> <b>her</b> spectacles, <b>and</b> began staring at <b>the</b> Hatter, who turned pale <b>and</b> fidgeted.
<br>“Give your evidence,” said <b>the</b> King; “<b>and</b> don't be nervous, <b>or</b> <b>I</b>'ll have you executed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot.”
<br>This did not seem <b>to</b> encourage <b>the</b> witness at all: he kept shifting form one foot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, looking uneasily at <b>the</b> Queen, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> his confusion he bit a large piece out <b>of</b> his teacup instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter.
<br>Just at this moment <b>Alice</b> felt a <b>very</b> curious sensation, which puzzled <b>her</b> a good deal until <b>she</b> made out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b>: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> grow larger again, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> at first <b>she</b> would <b>get</b> up <b>and</b> leave <b>the</b> court; <b>but</b> <b>on</b> second thoughts <b>she</b> decided <b>to</b> remain where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> as long as there <b>was</b> room for <b>her</b>.
<br>“<b>I</b> wish you wouldn't squeeze so.” said <b>the</b> Dormouse, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> next <b>to</b> <b>her</b>. “<b>I</b> can hardly breathe.”
<br>“<b>I</b> can't help <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b> <b>very</b> meekly: “<b>I</b>'m growing.”
<br>“You've <b>no</b> right <b>to</b> grow here,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse.
<br>“Don't talk nonsense,” said <b>Alice</b> more boldly: “you know you're growing too.”
<br>“Yes, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> grow at a reasonable pace,” said <b>the</b> Dormouse: “not <b>in</b> that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up <b>very</b> sulkily <b>and</b> crossed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court.
<br>All this time <b>the</b> Queen <b>had</b> never left off staring at <b>the</b> Hatter, <b>and</b>, just as <b>the</b> Dormouse crossed <b>the</b> court, <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court, “Bring me <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> singers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last concert!” <b>on</b> which <b>the</b> wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.
<br>“Give your evidence,” <b>the</b> King repeated angrily, “<b>or</b> <b>I</b>'ll have you executed, whether you're nervous <b>or</b> not.”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m a poor man, your Majesty,” <b>the</b> Hatter began, <b>in</b> a trembling voice, “—<b>and</b> <b>I</b> hadn't begun my tea—not above a week <b>or</b> so—<b>and</b> <b>what</b> with <b>the</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter getting so thin—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> twinkling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tea—”
<br>“The twinkling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>what</b>?” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“It began with <b>the</b> tea,” <b>the</b> Hatter replied.
<br>“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said <b>the</b> King sharply. “Do you take me for a dunce? Go <b>on</b>!”
<br>“<b>I</b>'m a poor man,” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b>, “<b>and</b> most things twinkled after that—only <b>the</b> March Hare said—”
<br>“<b>I</b> didn't!” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“<b>I</b> deny <b>it</b>!” said <b>the</b> King: “leave out that part.”
<br>“Well, at any rate, <b>the</b> Dormouse said—” <b>the</b> Hatter went <b>on</b>, looking anxiously round <b>to</b> see if he would deny <b>it</b> too: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Dormouse denied <b>nothing</b>, being fast asleep.
<br>“After that,” continued <b>the</b> Hatter, “<b>I</b> cut some more bread- <b>and</b>-butter—”
<br>“But <b>what</b> did <b>the</b> Dormouse say?” one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jury asked.
<br>“That <b>I</b> can't remember,” said <b>the</b> Hatter.
<br>“You MUST remember,” remarked <b>the</b> King, “<b>or</b> <b>I</b>'ll have you executed.”
<br>The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup <b>and</b> bread-<b>and</b>-butter, <b>and</b> went down <b>on</b> one knee. “<b>I</b>'m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
<br>“You're a <b>very</b> poor speaker,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>Here one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guinea-pigs cheered, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> immediately suppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. (As that <b>is</b> rather a hard word, <b>I</b> will just explain <b>to</b> you how <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done. They <b>had</b> a large canvas bag, which tied up at <b>the</b> mouth with strings: <b>into</b> this they slipped <b>the</b> guinea-pig, head first, <b>and</b> then sat upon <b>it</b>.)
<br>“<b>I</b>'m glad <b>I</b>'ve seen that done,” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. “<b>I</b>'ve so often read <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspapers, at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> trials, «There <b>was</b> some attempts at applause, which <b>was</b> immediately suppressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court,» <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never understood <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant till now.”
<br>“If that's all you know about <b>it</b>, you may stand down,” continued <b>the</b> King.
<br>“<b>I</b> can't go <b>no</b> lower,” said <b>the</b> Hatter: “<b>I</b>'m <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b>.”
<br>“Then you may SIT down,” <b>the</b> King replied.
<br>Here <b>the</b> other guinea-pig cheered, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> suppressed.
<br>“Come, that finished <b>the</b> guinea-pigs!” <b>thought</b> <b>Alice</b>. “Now we shall <b>get</b> <b>on</b> better.”
<br>“<b>I</b>'d rather finish my tea,” said <b>the</b> Hatter, with an anxious look at <b>the</b> Queen, who <b>was</b> <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> list <b>of</b> singers.
<br>“You may go,” said <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hatter hurriedly left <b>the</b> court, <b>without</b> even waiting <b>to</b> put his shoes <b>on</b>.
<br>“—<b>and</b> just take his head off outside,” <b>the</b> Queen added <b>to</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> officers: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> Hatter <b>was</b> out <b>of</b> sight before <b>the</b> officer could <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.
<br>“Call <b>the</b> next witness!” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>The next witness <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Duchess's cook. She carried <b>the</b> pepper-box <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hand, <b>and</b> <b>Alice</b> guessed who <b>it</b> <b>was</b>, even before <b>she</b> got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> court, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> people near <b>the</b> door began sneezing all at <b>once</b>.
<br>“Give your evidence,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Shan't,” said <b>the</b> cook.
<br>The King looked anxiously at <b>the</b> White Rabbit, who said <b>in</b> a low voice, “Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.”
<br>“Well, if <b>I</b> must, <b>I</b> must,” <b>the</b> King said, with a melancholy air, <b>and</b>, after folding his arms <b>and</b> frowning at <b>the</b> cook till his eyes were nearly out <b>of</b> sight, he said <b>in</b> a deep voice, “What are tarts made <b>of</b>?”
<br>“Pepper, mostly,” said <b>the</b> cook.
<br>“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind <b>her</b>.
<br>“Collar that Dormouse,” <b>the</b> Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out <b>of</b> court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!”
<br>For some minutes <b>the</b> whole court <b>was</b> <b>in</b> confusion, getting <b>the</b> Dormouse turned out, <b>and</b>, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time they <b>had</b> settled down again, <b>the</b> cook <b>had</b> disappeared.
<br>“Never mind!” said <b>the</b> King, with an air <b>of</b> great relief. “Call <b>the</b> next witness.” And he added <b>in</b> an undertone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen, “Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine <b>the</b> next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”
<br><b>Alice</b> watched <b>the</b> White Rabbit as he fumbled over <b>the</b> list, feeling <b>very</b> curious <b>to</b> see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> next witness would be like, “—for they haven't got much evidence YET,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself. Imagine <b>her</b> surprise, when <b>the</b> White Rabbit read out, at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> his shrill little voice, <b>the</b> name “<b>Alice</b>!”
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Chapter</b> XII
<br>ALICE'S EVIDENCE
<br>
<br>“Here!” cried <b>Alice</b>, quite forgetting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flurry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment how large <b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> jumped up <b>in</b> such a hurry that <b>she</b> tipped over <b>the</b> jury-box with <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt, upsetting all <b>the</b> jurymen <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crowd below, <b>and</b> there they lay sprawling about, reminding <b>her</b> <b>very</b> much <b>of</b> a globe <b>of</b> goldfish <b>she</b> <b>had</b> accidentally upset <b>the</b> week before.
<br>“Oh, <b>I</b> BEG your pardon!” <b>she</b> exclaimed <b>in</b> a tone <b>of</b> great dismay, <b>and</b> began picking them up again as quickly as <b>she</b> could, for <b>the</b> accident <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goldfish kept running <b>in</b> <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a vague sort <b>of</b> idea that they must be collected at <b>once</b> <b>and</b> put back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jury-box, <b>or</b> they would die.
<br>“The trial cannot proceed,” said <b>the</b> King <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> grave voice, “until all <b>the</b> jurymen are back <b>in</b> their proper places— ALL,” he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at <b>Alice</b> as he said <b>do</b>.
<br><b>Alice</b> looked at <b>the</b> jury-box, <b>and</b> saw that, <b>in</b> <b>her</b> haste, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> put <b>the</b> Lizard <b>in</b> head downwards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor little thing <b>was</b> waving its tail about <b>in</b> a melancholy way, being quite unable <b>to</b> move. She soon got <b>it</b> out again, <b>and</b> put <b>it</b> right; “not that <b>it</b> signifies much,” <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> herself; “<b>I</b> should think <b>it</b> would be QUITE as much <b>use</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trial one way up as <b>the</b> other.”
<br>As soon as <b>the</b> jury <b>had</b> a little recovered from <b>the</b> shock <b>of</b> being upset, <b>and</b> their slates <b>and</b> pencils <b>had</b> been found <b>and</b> handed back <b>to</b> them, they set <b>to</b> work <b>very</b> diligently <b>to</b> write out a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident, all except <b>the</b> Lizard, who seemed too much overcome <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything <b>but</b> sit with its mouth open, gazing up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court.
<br>“What <b>do</b> you know about this business?” <b>the</b> King said <b>to</b> <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Nothing,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Nothing WHATEVER?” persisted <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Nothing whatever,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“That's <b>very</b> important,” <b>the</b> King said, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury. They were just <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> write this down <b>on</b> their slates, when <b>the</b> White Rabbit interrupted: “UNimportant, your Majesty means, <b>of</b> course,” he said <b>in</b> a <b>very</b> respectful tone, <b>but</b> frowning <b>and</b> making faces at him as he spoke.
<br>“UNimportant, <b>of</b> course, <b>I</b> meant,” <b>the</b> King hastily said, <b>and</b> went <b>on</b> <b>to</b> himself <b>in</b> an undertone, “important—unimportant— unimportant—important—” as if he were trying which word sounded best.
<br>Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jury wrote <b>it</b> down “important,” <b>and</b> some “unimportant.” <b>Alice</b> could see this, as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> near enough <b>to</b> look over their slates; “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter a bit,” <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> herself.
<br>At this moment <b>the</b> King, who <b>had</b> been for some time busily writing <b>in</b> his note-<b>book</b>, cackled out “Silence!” <b>and</b> read out from his <b>book</b>, “Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE <b>THE</b> COURT.”
<br>Everybody looked at <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“<b>I</b>'M not a mile high,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“You are,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Nearly two miles high,” added <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Well, <b>I</b> shan't go, at any rate,” said <b>Alice</b>: “besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented <b>it</b> just now.”
<br>“It's <b>the</b> oldest rule <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b>,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>“Then <b>it</b> ought <b>to</b> be Number One,” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>The King turned pale, <b>and</b> shut his note-<b>book</b> hastily. “Consider your verdict,” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jury, <b>in</b> a low, trembling voice.
<br>“There's more evidence <b>to</b> come yet, please your Majesty,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, jumping up <b>in</b> a great hurry; “this paper has just been picked up.”
<br>“What's <b>in</b> <b>it</b>?” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“<b>I</b> haven't opened <b>it</b> yet, said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, “<b>but</b> <b>it</b> seems <b>to</b> be a letter, written <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prisoner <b>to</b>—<b>to</b> somebody.”
<br>“It must have been that,” said <b>the</b> King, “unless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written <b>to</b> nobody, which isn't usual, you know.”
<br>“Who <b>is</b> <b>it</b> directed <b>to</b>?” said one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurymen.
<br>“It isn't directed at all,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit; “<b>in</b> fact, there's <b>nothing</b> written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> OUTSIDE.” He unfolded <b>the</b> paper as he spoke, <b>and</b> added “It isn't a letter, after all: <b>it</b>'s a set <b>of</b> verses.”
<br>“Are they <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prisoner's handwriting?” asked another <b>of</b> they jurymen.
<br>“No, they're not,” said <b>the</b> White Rabbit, “<b>and</b> that's <b>the</b> queerest thing about <b>it</b>.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)
<br>“He must have imitated somebody else's hand,” said <b>the</b> King. (The jury all brightened up again.)
<br>“Please your Majesty,” said <b>the</b> Knave, “<b>I</b> didn't write <b>it</b>, <b>and</b> they can't prove <b>I</b> did: there's <b>no</b> name signed at <b>the</b> end.”
<br>“If you didn't sign <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> King, “that only makes <b>the</b> matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, <b>or</b> else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.”
<br>There <b>was</b> a general clapping <b>of</b> hands at this: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first really clever thing <b>the</b> King <b>had</b> said that day.
<br>“That PROVES his guilt,” said <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“It proves <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort!” said <b>Alice</b>. “Why, you don't even know <b>what</b> they're about!”
<br>“Read them,” said <b>the</b> King.
<br>The White Rabbit put <b>on</b> his spectacles. “Where shall <b>I</b> begin, please your Majesty?” he asked.
<br>“Begin at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b>,” <b>the</b> King said gravely, “<b>and</b> go <b>on</b> till you come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end: then stop.”
<br>These were <b>the</b> verses <b>the</b> White Rabbit read:—
<br>
<br>“They told me you <b>had</b> been <b>to</b> <b>her</b>,
<br>And mentioned me <b>to</b> him:
<br>She gave me a good character,
<br>But said <b>I</b> could not swim.
<br>He sent them word <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not gone
<br>(We know <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be true):
<br>If <b>she</b> should push <b>the</b> matter <b>on</b>,
<br>What would become <b>of</b> you?
<br><b>I</b> gave <b>her</b> one, they gave him two,
<br>You gave us three <b>or</b> more;
<br>They all returned from him <b>to</b> you,
<br>Though they were mine before.
<br>If <b>I</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should chance <b>to</b> be
<br>Involved <b>in</b> this affair,
<br>He trusts <b>to</b> you <b>to</b> set them free,
<br>Exactly as we were.
<br>My notion <b>was</b> that you <b>had</b> been
<br>(Before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> this fit)
<br>An obstacle that came between
<br>Him, <b>and</b> ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b>.
<br>Don't let him know <b>she</b> liked them best,
<br>For this must ever be
<br>A secret, kept from all <b>the</b> rest,
<br>Between yourself <b>and</b> me.”
<br>
<br>“That's <b>the</b> most important piece <b>of</b> evidence we've heard yet,” said <b>the</b> King, rubbing his hands; “so now let <b>the</b> jury—”
<br>“If any one <b>of</b> them can explain <b>it</b>,” said <b>Alice</b>, (<b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown so large <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few minutes that <b>she</b> wasn't a bit afraid <b>of</b> interrupting him,) “<b>I</b>'ll give him sixpence. _<b>I</b>_ don't believe there's an atom <b>of</b> meaning <b>in</b> <b>it</b>.”
<br>The jury all wrote down <b>on</b> their slates, “SHE doesn't believe there's an atom <b>of</b> meaning <b>in</b> <b>it</b>,” <b>but</b> none <b>of</b> them attempted <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> paper.
<br>“If there's <b>no</b> meaning <b>in</b> <b>it</b>,” said <b>the</b> King, “that saves a world <b>of</b> trouble, you know, as we needn't try <b>to</b> find any. And yet <b>I</b> don't know,” he went <b>on</b>, spreading out <b>the</b> verses <b>on</b> his knee, <b>and</b> looking at them with one eye; “<b>I</b> seem <b>to</b> see some meaning <b>in</b> them, after all. «—SAID <b>I</b> COULD NOT SWIM—» you can't swim, can you?” he added, turning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Knave.
<br>The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do <b>I</b> look like <b>it</b>?” he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely <b>of</b> cardboard.)
<br>“All right, so far,” said <b>the</b> King, <b>and</b> he went <b>on</b> muttering over <b>the</b> verses <b>to</b> himself: “"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE—» that's <b>the</b> jury, <b>of</b> course— «<b>I</b> GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO—» why, that must be <b>what</b> he did with <b>the</b> tarts, you know—”
<br>“But, <b>it</b> goes <b>on</b> «THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"“ said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Why, there they are!” said <b>the</b> King triumphantly, pointing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tarts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table. “Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again—"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT—» you never <b>had</b> fits, my dear, <b>I</b> think?” he said <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen.
<br>“Never!” said <b>the</b> Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at <b>the</b> Lizard as <b>she</b> spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill <b>had</b> left off writing <b>on</b> his slate with one finger, as he found <b>it</b> made <b>no</b> mark; <b>but</b> he now hastily began again, using <b>the</b> ink, that <b>was</b> trickling down his face, as long as <b>it</b> lasted.)
<br>“Then <b>the</b> words don't FIT you,” said <b>the</b> King, looking round <b>the</b> court with a smile. There <b>was</b> a dead silence.
<br>“It's a pun!” <b>the</b> King added <b>in</b> an offended tone, <b>and</b> everybody laughed, “Let <b>the</b> jury consider their verdict,” <b>the</b> King said, for about <b>the</b> twentieth time that day.
<br>“No, <b>no</b>!” said <b>the</b> Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”
<br>“Stuff <b>and</b> nonsense!” said <b>Alice</b> loudly. “The idea <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> sentence first!”
<br>“Hold your tongue!” said <b>the</b> Queen, turning purple.
<br>“<b>I</b> won't!” said <b>Alice</b>.
<br>“Off with <b>her</b> head!” <b>the</b> Queen shouted at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice. Nobody moved.
<br>“Who cares for you?” said <b>Alice</b>, (<b>she</b> <b>had</b> grown <b>to</b> <b>her</b> full size <b>by</b> this time.) “You're <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a pack <b>of</b> cards!”
<br>At this <b>the</b> whole pack rose up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air, <b>and</b> came flying down upon <b>her</b>: <b>she</b> gave a little scream, half <b>of</b> fright <b>and</b> half <b>of</b> anger, <b>and</b> tried <b>to</b> beat them off, <b>and</b> found herself lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b>, with <b>her</b> head <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lap <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>sister</b>, who <b>was</b> gently brushing away some dead leaves that <b>had</b> fluttered down from <b>the</b> trees upon <b>her</b> face.
<br>“Wake up, <b>Alice</b> dear!” said <b>her</b> <b>sister</b>; “Why, <b>what</b> a long sleep you've <b>had</b>!”
<br>“Oh, <b>I</b>'ve <b>had</b> such a curious dream!” said <b>Alice</b>, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> told <b>her</b> <b>sister</b>, as well as <b>she</b> could remember them, all these strange <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> hers that you have just been <b>reading</b> about; <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> finished, <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> kissed <b>her</b>, <b>and</b> said, “It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: <b>but</b> now run <b>in</b> <b>to</b> your tea; <b>it</b>'s getting late.” So <b>Alice</b> got up <b>and</b> ran off, thinking while <b>she</b> ran, as well <b>she</b> might, <b>what</b> a wonderful dream <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been.
<br>But <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> sat still just as <b>she</b> left <b>her</b>, leaning <b>her</b> head <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hand, watching <b>the</b> setting sun, <b>and</b> thinking <b>of</b> little <b>Alice</b> <b>and</b> all <b>her</b> wonderful <b>Adventures</b>, till <b>she</b> too began dreaming after a fashion, <b>and</b> this <b>was</b> <b>her</b> dream:—
<br>First, <b>she</b> dreamed <b>of</b> little <b>Alice</b> herself, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> again <b>the</b> tiny hands were clasped upon <b>her</b> knee, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bright eager eyes were looking up <b>into</b> hers—<b>she</b> could hear <b>the</b> <b>very</b> tones <b>of</b> <b>her</b> voice, <b>and</b> see that queer little toss <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head <b>to</b> keep back <b>the</b> wandering hair that WOULD always <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> eyes—<b>and</b> still as <b>she</b> listened, <b>or</b> seemed <b>to</b> listen, <b>the</b> whole place around <b>her</b> became alive <b>the</b> strange creatures <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>sister</b>'s dream.
<br>The long grass rustled at <b>her</b> feet as <b>the</b> White Rabbit hurried <b>by</b>—<b>the</b> frightened Mouse splashed his way through <b>the</b> neighbouring pool—<b>she</b> could hear <b>the</b> rattle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teacups as <b>the</b> March Hare <b>and</b> his friends shared their never-ending meal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shrill voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen ordering off <b>her</b> unfortunate guests <b>to</b> execution—<b>once</b> more <b>the</b> pig-baby <b>was</b> sneezing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Duchess's knee, while plates <b>and</b> dishes crashed around <b>it</b>—<b>once</b> more <b>the</b> shriek <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>the</b> squeaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lizard's slate-pencil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> choking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppressed guinea-pigs, filled <b>the</b> air, mixed up with <b>the</b> distant sobs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> miserable Mock Turtle.
<br>So <b>she</b> sat <b>on</b>, with closed eyes, <b>and</b> half believed herself <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b>, though <b>she</b> knew <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>but</b> <b>to</b> open them again, <b>and</b> all would change <b>to</b> dull reality—<b>the</b> grass would be only rustling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pool rippling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reeds—<b>the</b> rattling teacups would change <b>to</b> tinkling sheep- bells, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen's shrill cries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shepherd boy—<b>and</b> <b>the</b> sneeze <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baby, <b>the</b> shriek <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gryphon, <b>and</b> all thy other queer noises, would change (<b>she</b> knew) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> confused clamour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> busy farm-yard—while <b>the</b> lowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance would take <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
<br>Lastly, <b>she</b> pictured <b>to</b> herself how this same little <b>sister</b> <b>of</b> hers would, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> after-time, be herself a grown woman; <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> would keep, through all <b>her</b> riper years, <b>the</b> simple <b>and</b> loving heart <b>of</b> <b>her</b> childhood: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> would gather about <b>her</b> other little children, <b>and</b> make THEIR eyes bright <b>and</b> eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with <b>the</b> dream <b>of</b> <b>Wonderland</b> <b>of</b> long ago: <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> would feel with all their simple sorrows, <b>and</b> find a pleasure <b>in</b> all their simple joys, remembering <b>her</b> own child-life, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> happy summer days.
