Alice was beginning to ;get very tired of
1
sit;ing by her sister on the blank, and of
1
having not;hing to do: once or tw;ice she had
2
peep;;ed into the book her sist;er was reading,

but it had no pi;ctures or conversations in it,

"and what is the use; of a book," thought Alice
1
"without p;;ictures or conver;;sation?"4
